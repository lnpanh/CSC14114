83	neg	Really annoying and unfortunately the problem developed just a few days outside the 1 year warranty window, so I replaced it with a Razer Viper Ultimate and I'm much happier with it than the G502
84	pos	I bought the original (non-Hero) G502 about 5 years ago and loved it
84	pos	I bought this mouse as a backup and just opened it up about a month ago when the scroll wheel of my original got a piece of dust stuck in it and would center click as I scrolled
84	pos	I've since got the piece out and it works fine again though
84	pos	I have larger hands and this mouse is a little longer than others I've tried so it fits me really well
84	pos	I love the freewheel scroll feature
84	pos	I don't think I will be able to go back to a mouse without that after using this thing
84	pos	This mouse has just about everything I could ask for
84	pos	Different profiles, on the fly sensitivity changes, plenty of buttons, customizable RGB
84	pos	Its a fairly heavy mouse even without the weights
84	pos	I have left the weights out completely of both of my mice
84	pos	I would say it is fairly durable
84	pos	I have 2 younger children and my original G502 has held up to years of their abuse and I'm sure the new one will as well
84	pos	At $37, I will probably be buying a 3rd one just to keep as a backup
85	neg	If I had to buy it over again based on the mouse alone I wouldn't
85	neg	Ergonomically, it feels bulky and a bit awkward
85	neg	Since that's a bit subjective, I'd say it might be worth a look at if your hands are on the larger side, however the software from day 1 has been buggy, and not worked properly
85	neg	Ive tinkered with it for a few weeks now and still cant get it to to start with the computer
85	neg	It still periodically freezes and requires a re-install to get it working again
85	neg	Google "LG hub error" and make your decision based off those results
85	neg	If the software's going to be integral it should be light, precise and stable
85	neg	It is none of those things
85	neg	3/19/21 update: Now Logitech Ghub sporadically switches profiles
85	neg	More errors
85	neg	Google results show many with the same issue
85	neg	Running this on a 2020 RTX laptop, so hardware compatibility should not be an issue
85	neg	Downgraded to 1 star because I am no longer using the mouse due to software issues
85	neg	7/13/21 update: More Ghub issues- freezes and there is an article on how to fix the problem online (so it's a known issue) but it is a tedious process to re-install the proper way (doing a simple add/remove wont work and the error persists) At this point, assuming GHUB is part of all logitech mice, I would avoid Logitech mice all together
86	pos	I got this because I thought it had some heft to it, but even with all the weights added to it it's still a bit light, but it is better than the ultra light 3 button mouse I was using
86	pos	I have large hands and it is just a touch small for me
86	pos	The scroll wheel seems to be a bit too sensitive, although that might be due to some software glitch that the last Windows update caused
86	pos	You can't turn the RGB off but you can set it to one colour and not have it flashing
86	pos	Also the DPI buttons are on the side where my thumb rests, I have no reason to change them on the fly, and would rather have the usual extra 2 buttons there instead of on the top left of the mouse
87	pos	I bought this mouse to replace a very disappointing Corsair mouse of similar design that finally wore out
87	pos	I can say that this mouse stands up next to the Corsair counterparts reasonably well albeit with a bit less "flair"
87	pos	I found the feel and movement to be comparable and the DPI setting ranges are equal if not a bit better in this case
87	pos	There are plenty of buttons and the customizable weight was a feature that I first thought was largely useless, but actually gave me a chance to improve the feel and movement from the "stock" configuration
87	pos	The one drawback I've found is the scroll wheel
87	pos	You have two options: rock hard or complete freewheel
87	pos	After using it for a few weeks I determined that the "rock hard" setting became tiresome when scrolling through webpages and that the freewheel setting enabled quick scrolling
87	pos	However, when in freewheel, the wheel has a terrible tendency to have backlash, most likely due to the sensor design
87	pos	I haven't encountered any broken switches or movements, but suspect several of the reports of "broken wheels" may be due either to the user not realizing the mode is toggled by the (undocumented) toggle "button" just below the wheel or using the "button" as a brake in freewheel mode, which I found will likely cause the ratcheting mechanism to bind and break
87	pos	Another somewhat disappointing feature of the wheel is that the left and right scroll wheel movements are single clicks rather than repeating, which requires repeated clicking left or right to scroll instead of having a continuous movement like older Logitech mice did
87	pos	I found the left-right scroll doesn't work with all programs either (Excel being one), which was also a disappointment
87	pos	Another recent discovery is that, like the Corsair I had previously, recent updates to their software can cause severe system crashes, which has led me to disable updating altogether
87	pos	Attempts to alert the company to this issue met with a canned response, leading me to believe they're not too concerned about the quality of their driver software, which is unfortunate
87	pos	This would be a five-star mouse if the scroll wheel was improved and if we didn't have to worry about a driver software update completely breaking our systems without warning
88	neg	The media could not be loaded
88	neg	For the first year this mouse was truly fantastic, would have whole-heartedly given it 5 stars, however after only a single year I have encountered a problem that renders the mouse nigh unusable
88	neg	After only a single year, the primary button, m1, suffers from severe stuttering and unreliable response from user inputs
88	neg	It is utterly ridiculous for a mouse at this price point to suffer from a hardware flaw like this so soon, and apparently it is a common issue with many other logitech brand mice
88	neg	Trying to navigate through the Logitech warranty website is a purposefully roundabout experience in order to do anything except give you a replacement under their own warranty policy
88	neg	This is  made increasingly more aggravating by attempting to fight your way through their site with a busted mouse
88	neg	Needless to say I am very disappointed in my purchase and will be avoiding Logitech for any future hardware needs
89	neg	This mouse is a major disappointment----1--The biggest problem is a defective left-click button ---- The button operates randomly and can take anywhere from 1 to 4 clicks to open a program
89	neg	When I went online to see if the defect was solvable, there were 100s of “Logitech Mouse Button Click Problems” hits
89	neg	Given the button defect, the mouse is being returned
89	neg	2--The new Logitech 9
89	neg	02 gaming software is a pain in the neck and worked so poorly that I uninstalled it and reverted to a prior version of the software that is far more user-friendly
89	neg	3--The mouse wheel has a slippery graphite feel, which is somewhat surprising for a mouse built for exact mouse movement
89	neg	4--The “user documentation” that came with the mouse was limited to a few small stick figures with text so small that I had to pull out a magnifying glass to read it
89	neg	The mouse did come with a large G decal and a fancy, but useless, color promo flyer----  I suspect that most users would prefer that you dump the flyer and decal and devote more focus to a decent instruction sheet
90	neg	Just holding this mouse makes my wrist cramp, it forces a claw-grip with your pinky and ring finger to hold the mouse and is extremely uncomfortable when you have to grip it hard
90	neg	The Software (G Hub) is required, and has to be RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND at all times in order for 90% of the mouse's features to work
90	neg	The mouse claims to have on-board memory but NONE of the settings can be customized with it, you can only use pre-made profiles which all suck
90	neg	So if you want to change DPI, Polling Rate, or any of the button functions, you need G Hub running at all times
90	neg	For folks like me who like to squeeze as much performance from their machines as possible, this is unacceptable
90	neg	In my task manager right now there are 6 different G Hub
90	neg	exes using up a total of 246 CPU threads, and an absurd 300mb of RAM
90	neg	If the mouse had working on-board memory this wouldn't even be worth mentioning, but it doesn't, so it is
90	neg	Coming from a G700 (another Logitech mouse) I thought this mouse would be an upgrade, little did I know that my 7 year old mouse was leaps and bounds ahead of this modern brick
90	neg	My G700 also needed Logitech software to customize, but it had WORKING ON-BOARD MEMORY, meaning if I wanted to set the DPI and save it to the mouse for use on another PC I could easily do so, with the new G Hub software this is impossible
91	pos	07/19/2021I've bought this product twice, once back in November of 2019, a second time a week ago
91	pos	The issue was that the left click was no longer working as intended
91	pos	I was not able to click and drag anything and would occasionally register a double click
91	pos	Apparently this is a common issue, but at the price, I just couldn't find another mouse that could compete
91	pos	At the price, it's reasonable, I just wish if it was such a common issue, for it to have been fixed already especially since it's one of their more popular gaming mouse
91	pos	Since then, I've also purchased a MX Master 3 and use them side by side depending on my uses
91	pos	It's still one of the better gaming mouse out there, especially for the price
92	pos	To fully take advantage of this mouse's precision, go to the mouse settings on Windows, set it to the slowest setting, then go into the Logitech software and up the DPI
92	pos	This will give you the most precise tracking you can get from the mouse
92	pos	A lost of people seem to just use a lower DPI in the mouse software and wonder why with small movements, the mouse becomes jumpy
92	pos	Don't be that person
92	pos	Set up your software correctly
92	pos	And why do you want to do it this way
92	pos	Well, because the mouse has buttons with which you can slow it down or speed it back up anytime - it works in normal windows mode and in games on a hardware level and there is no adjustment needed after you set it up initially
92	pos	The other way round, you would have to go into game and/or Windows settings to make those changes
92	pos	PS: I also have the G900 and G903 with PowerPlay
92	pos	I use the G502 HERO for my work machine I mainly use for office work and I used a cheaper mouse before that was just so annoying when trying to pull on Excel cell corners - you need the precision at that place
92	pos	However, I didn't want to break the bank after spending over $200 for a wireless low latency setup on my gaming PC
92	pos	This mouse has all that for less than $50 with the only limitation that it is wired
92	pos	I love heavier mice and this one has weights
92	pos	Surely a Plus as well for me
93	neg	if you want a great gaming mouse that remembers your settings, this is NOT what you're looking for
93	neg	look
93	neg	all the other positive reviews about the features, buttons, button sets, etc
93	neg	are true
93	neg	this has the potential to be SUCH a great mouse
93	neg	but *EVERY* time it does an update to its software (which is at least once a week) it WIPES OUT all your settings
93	neg	so you have to go back through and ONE BY ONE put each setting back on each button
93	neg	sometimes 3 times a week
93	neg	logitech has confirmed this is the EXPECTED behavior
93	neg	the "work around"
93	neg	they expect YOu to export your settings to the cloud, and then reimport EVERY time it updates
93	neg	so i turned off auto updates
93	neg	guess what
93	neg	IT AUTO UPDATES ANYWAY
93	neg	it COMPLETELY ignores your settings to not update
93	neg	this behavior exists on both mac and pc
93	neg	THIS
93	neg	THING
93	neg	IS
93	neg	GARBAGE
94	pos	I’ve read a lot of reviews where people complain about a double clicking issue or uncomfortable button locations and stuff so I thought I’d share my thoughts
94	pos	I got it a week ago and so far I’ve experienced zero issues with it whatsoever but the double clicking problem usually doesn’t develop until later so if it does come up eventually, I will update my review
94	pos	The sensor is this mouse is legit, one of the best I’ve ever come across and I’ve used a lot of gaming mice in my life
94	pos	From Razer to Alienware, this one competes with the best of them
94	pos	The adjustable weights are also a plus
94	pos	I’m not hardcore on FPS so I don’t use them but they can come in handy for those of you who are into shooters
94	pos	The extra buttons are also a big plus
94	pos	It has a couple and they can be very useful
94	pos	The only downside I can think of is the mouse itself is rather a bit small for my taste and I think it could use a pinky support but I do have large hands so perhaps it isn’t applicable for everyone
94	pos	Also while it does have many extra buttons, the thumb one is awkwardly positioned right under the thumb so I frequently press it by mistake
94	pos	The two index finger buttons next to left click are also a bit inconvenient because one would have to move the index finger off the important left click to use them
94	pos	Conclusion: I got it on sale for $39
94	pos	99 and for the price it’s a fantastic deal
94	pos	At its full price of $80 however they may be better options but either way, it is a solid product
95	pos	I've always loved the Magic Mouse and can't give that up because of the multitouch features, but this mouse is so comfortable, and moves so effortlessly, I actually look forward to using it for gaming
95	pos	Once I got it configured for a particular game, it's actually improved my playing because of the multi-button functionality
95	pos	Moving functions to the mouse instead of trying to handle multiple actions at once on the keyboard has been a huge benefit, and has actually made the game more enjoyable to play
95	pos	Nothing can replace the multi-gesture functionality of Apple's Magic Mouse surface, but this is fully in use now and I really enjoy it
95	pos	It feels very solid and slides effortlessly
95	pos	I have a small hand that has no trouble reaching all the buttons and features, and its response rate is fantastic
96	pos	So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5
96	pos	It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right
96	pos	Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great
96	pos	Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse
96	pos	The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached
96	pos	I saw another review with a similar complaint
96	pos	The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse
96	pos	It's apparently an issue
96	pos	Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb
96	pos	The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far
96	pos	I have pretty large hands
96	pos	XXL for gloves
96	pos	That button is way to far forward
96	pos	Finally, compared to the G5
96	pos	This thing feels really cheap
96	pos	The buttons are super flimsy
96	pos	The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance
96	pos	I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it
96	pos	I don't know
96	pos	I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid
96	pos	Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap
96	pos	Had I paid full price, I would be returning it
96	pos	Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more
96	pos	No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though
96	pos	Update:Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues
96	pos	First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse
96	pos	Which is fine
96	pos	The old Logitech software sucked
96	pos	Hard
96	pos	Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better
96	pos	First, it wants to do a firmware update
96	pos	So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware
96	pos	If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in
96	pos	That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software
96	pos	Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so
96	pos	You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays
96	pos	When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing
96	pos	Yet, it won't be doing it
96	pos	For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default
96	pos	So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there
96	pos	dark
96	pos	The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time
96	pos	But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights
96	pos	Instead you have to click on the main "Settings" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time
96	pos	I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this
96	pos	Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box
96	pos	Dumb dumb dumb
96	pos	I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb
96	pos	That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI
96	pos	That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much
96	pos	With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way
96	pos	As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly
96	pos	They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing
96	pos	I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice
96	pos	Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed
96	pos	Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use
96	pos	The center wheel
96	pos	Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy
96	pos	Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out
96	pos	Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture
96	pos	Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world
96	pos	Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel
96	pos	There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth
96	pos	Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars
96	pos	I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though
96	pos	It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box
96	pos	And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well
96	pos	I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well
96	pos	Still braided, but way more flexible
96	pos	Hopefully it holds up as well
97	pos	So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it
97	pos	First is the design:The design, while unusual, works fairly well
97	pos	I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons
97	pos	Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it
97	pos	It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do
97	pos	The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed
97	pos	It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons
97	pos	Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button)
97	pos	As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable
97	pos	If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB
97	pos	The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games
97	pos	In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play
97	pos	Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it
97	pos	Second is the software:The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same
97	pos	Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you
97	pos	It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind
97	pos	One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button)
97	pos	All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it
97	pos	G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded
97	pos	(G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside
97	pos	Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates
97	pos	Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well
97	pos	Third is the delivery:It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area
97	pos	I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive
97	pos	Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing
97	pos	As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time
97	pos	If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far
97	pos	But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly
98	pos	This is a fantastic mouse
98	pos	The buttons and even the scroll wheel are PERFECTLY clicky
98	pos	If you don't like that, the scroll wheel "click" can be turned off with the button directly under it, so it free spins
98	pos	You can also download it's user interface where you can download other users set-ups for specific games, etc
98	pos	and can built your own, along with setting up the "G" logo color palette
98	pos	The color vibrance and transition is so smooth and bright looking, I actually left it rainbow (my pics did not at all do the colors justice)
98	pos	The sides are rubberized, which provides excellent control for button use
98	pos	The 2 thumb buttons, 1 in front of the thumb rest & 1 above, and the 2 on the left button are extremely well placed, easy to use, but do not get accidently pushed easily
98	pos	The bottom is slighlt gridded for friction & the wire is covered in woven nylon & runs about 6 ft
98	pos	Oh, and it comes with a 5 pack of weights in their own case
98	pos	I couldn't be happier with this mouse
99	pos	I upgraded from Razer Basilisk (wired) and I would say, it is an upgrade
99	pos	Way better/more customization option, buttons clicks really good and overall build quality is awesome despite the cost of this mouse just being 40$
99	pos	Little plastic container contains multiple weights to weigh down your mouse is a surprise for me
99	pos	Those thing fits under discretely
99	pos	Now, there's one issue that has been really bothering me is the placement of G7 and G8 buttons mainly meant for upping and lowering DPI sensitivity into however many DPI stages you've added in G-Hub
99	pos	Placement sucks
99	pos	Left click is narrow and I can easily hit G7 and lowers my DPI sensitivity making me die, a lot while playing FPS such as Halo Infinite or while browsing through the internet I accidentally lower my DPI when I just want to casually browse
99	pos	If it was placed differently or had stiffer click to prevent accidents, then I wouldn't have any issues
99	pos	"But you can turn them off
99	pos	" Everyone has a different playing style and customization, I personally need them to adjust for whatever games I play so I keep accidentally lowering my sensitivity mid-game, it just ruins the moment
99	pos	Other than that issue, overall mouse is really good
99	pos	Like, actually good
100	neg	The weights are good but standard
100	neg	The resolution as expected
100	neg	Button presses require very little force (I would bet the switches would be the first things to fail)
100	neg	Update few months later: docked two stars, left button has developed switch bounce and now sometimes clicks multiple times with one press of the button
100	neg	Update months laterer: Oh man, you're gonna love this
100	neg	Button got worse (couldn't even drag anything; real fun playing the "which folder did the file get dropped into
100	neg	" game) then the right button started to display similar issues
100	neg	Logitech did send me a new one, buuuuuut
100	neg	It took me a month or two to actually get the warranty process started and it's a huge hassle
100	neg	Even once the warranty process starts and someone actually contacts you, it's only to give you a many-steps email to get you to do the troubleshooting for them (including removing their own software which makes sense as it's basically malware; it's bad)
100	neg	They make you, no joke, record a video of you clicking on a website they send you to with:- the mouse visible,- the website url visible,- the "double click counter" visible, AND- a HANDWRITTEN NOTE with the ticket number written on it
100	neg	If you can jump through all those flaming hoops and prove that, indeed, the issue you said it had (months ago) was really real they're going to have you then take a picture with:- the mouse visible,- the S/N visible (and it has to be the one on the product, not the box), AND-
100	neg	ANOTHER handwritten note with the S/N and the ticket number written on it
100	neg	I'll be honest, I expected them to next request I take a picture of myself holding the mouse with the ticket number scratched into my forehead while holding a newspaper like some sort of kidnapping victim
100	neg	They didn't ask for that, however; instead, they asked for all of my details and sent me a new one
100	neg	So, in summary:- they replaced defective product and I love being able to drag files or select text again, that's one (1) shiny gold star for Logitech added
100	neg	- they made the process so painful I'd rather have a cage-match with a gang of feral cats all hopped up on catnip and PCP than go through it again, TWO STAR: MINUS  >:-[If yours develops any issue at all during Amazon return/replace period, do it before that time runs out
100	neg	Interestingly, they don't even seem to want the mouse with the bad switch back, which would be an easy/cheap fix
100	neg	I thought they made me go through all that 'cause they're so expensive to make or something, heck they already spent a lot of money on labor hours, but
100	neg	nope
100	neg	That's right, the expensive (well
100	neg	more than $10) mouse they want you to perform 3 miracles to replace isn't worth shipping that tiny box over
101	pos	Generally, you hear a lot of good things about Logitech mice, but this one might possibly be the best one from them
101	pos	Between being able to customize the other buttons on your mouse, on top of your DPI, but it also has an unlockable mouse wheel
101	pos	Scrolling through a big inventory, or a long thread online
101	pos	Unhinge that bad boy, blare some eurobeat, and rip your finger off of the wheel
101	pos	The wheel itself is comfortable, and really sturdy when you're clicking, or even scrolling
101	pos	The other buttons don't get in the way of your clicks, and the wheel lock is completely out of the way when you're using it
101	pos	The only (probably personal) issue I have so far is, my mouse does glitch out, and moves either in one direction, or spasms
101	pos	I don't have any dust, nor debris on my mouth, so I'm unsure if I have a faulty mouse, or it could be one of those model-specific issues
101	pos	Regardless of that, this is a really nice mouse for its price
101	pos	The firmware is great (not needed), the mouse is comfortable, and if you're a fan of weighted mice like I am, it has a sizeable, adjustable weight you can fit inside
102	neg	Have gone through two of these mice already and same issue both times
102	neg	After about a year the mouse will cause the camera to look straight up and the M2 (right click) button completely gives out
102	neg	Good luck playing any FPS game without rage quitting when this inevitably occurs
102	neg	Its disappointing because brand new, the G520 Hero is a great gaming mouse
102	neg	It fits nicely in the hand, has adjustable weights, and the perfect number of buttons for most gaming styles
102	neg	Would love to purchase another but can not justify throwing more money at Logitech for a product I know will fail within a year
103	pos	The G502 is replacing two faulty Corsairs - the M65 Pro RGB and the Harpoon RGB
103	pos	Both are having typical left click failures, so I wanted something heavy with a larger footprint like the M65
103	pos	Logitech got a lot right with this design, which is why I'm not surprised it hasn't changed much over the years
103	pos	The ability to add weights is a huge plus for me since I love a large, heavy mouse for some weird reason
103	pos	The magnetic flap is one of my favorite design choices as well - it's dead simple and honestly really cool
103	pos	The scroll wheel is solid and tactile, and provides a rewarding click when using
103	pos	With the scroll button disengaged, the scroll wheel is buttery smoooooth
103	pos	I definitely dig it, especially because this mouse pulls double-duty between my gaming PC and my work laptop
103	pos	Honestly, the only issue I've found is that DPI switches positioned essentially on the left click (G7 and G8) can prove to be an annoyance if you miss the click and unintentionally increase/decrease the DPI
103	pos	I think this issue is mainly on me, though
103	pos	I change up my grips periodically, so it's really just acclimatizing to the mouse at this point
103	pos	Overall, I really dig the G502
103	pos	I've always avoided Logitech products because of their "office" products, but this mouse has definitely exceeded my expectations so far
103	pos	Since I'm still breaking it in, I'll probably update this review if it starts doing anything wonky
104	pos	I am having tracking issues with mine
104	pos	It's mainly my table to blame, but my Razor mouse don't have a problem with my desk and mouse pad
104	pos	The software does not allow me to calibrate my sensor for my mouse pad nor does it let me adjust the lift off distance like Razor software can
104	pos	My table is plastic table and the weight of my pc and monitor bow the middle of the my table causing a sunk in effect
104	pos	My table also has ripples / waves you can feel with your hand when you slide across
104	pos	The mouse pad I have hides the ripples to some degree
104	pos	So this mouse not taking a liking to this and thus not working out for me
104	pos	But when using it, you can feel it hang on something and stop moving for a sec
104	pos	My Razor mouse does not have any issue
104	pos	You can glide my Razor mouse across gravel and it still make head shots
104	pos	But this mouse not working for me
105	pos	I got this to replace a Logitech G403 Prodigy that I've had and enjoyed for 3yrs but recently developed a failing left-click switch
105	pos	I got this instead of another G403 because it was a little cheaper, apparently "the most popular gaming mouse", and has more buttons (though I don't think I'd really need all the extras)
105	pos	Two issues immediately stood out
105	pos	First, my ring finger has a place to rest on the right edge of the G403, while this mouse doesn't quite have room for it, so I'd need to modify my grip to either squeeze it on with my middle finger, or drop it over the side
105	pos	It probably wouldn't be a huge deal in the long run, but I noticed the difference in ergonomics right away
105	pos	Second, and the reason I chose to immediately return the mouse and order another G403 (a HERO this time, because that's what's available) is the scrollwheel
105	pos	The G502 scrollwheel has a slick metal surface that's almost slippery, and a LOUD clicking in step-mode
105	pos	The button for switching to smooth scrolling is a nice feature, but in step mode it's just too clunky
105	pos	By contrast, the G403 has a rubberized wheel surface that requires very little force to use and light detents that silently provide just the right amount of feedback for stepped scrolling without adding appreciable resistance
106	neg	I had an iBuyPower mouse that lasted me six years I got for $11 at a thrift store
106	neg	This g502 Logitech Hero hasn't even lasted me two years
106	neg	I was waiting to review this for this purpose
106	neg	I'm now back to using the thrift store mouse because the g502 Hero is no longer functioning
106	neg	The upside: The mouse feels nice and glides effortlessly across most surfaces
106	neg	It is comfortable
106	neg	Primary Issues: Comfort is about all this piece of junk has going for it
106	neg	Left click doesn't double click all the time, and actually stopped "clicking" a few months into use so now I just have to guess since there is no audible click or touch-sensory click
106	neg	The right click doesn't work at all most of the time and that's important for some games and functions I use on my computer, so I have to use my other mouse entirely for that purpose
106	neg	Glider Wheel broke several months in
106	neg	I was able to fix it by cleaning it out the first time, thinking it was just general build up or something, but the second time the button which allows you to utilize the smooth wheel versus the click wheel went out, and any time I try to up-scroll it doesn't register as a scroll and instead registers as me clicking the wheel
106	neg	Again, the right click stopped working
106	neg	It still clicks, I can feel it, I can hear it, but the mouse doesn't react
106	neg	I disassembled, cleaned, reassembled and still nothing
106	neg	Unreliable DPI stability feature
106	neg	Sometimes my DPI will drop well below acceptable usability, then recover on its own
106	neg	The entire software setup, this gHub or whatever, is absolute garbage
106	neg	Completely
106	neg	Ridiculous
106	neg	Trash
106	neg	It is a convoluted mess requiring so much more work than is necessary to use
106	neg	It crashes for no reason despite updates, does not save profiles, does not let you utilize macros, is not user friendly, and requires manual startup
106	neg	If you click to open it, it just sits on the "Update" screen indefinitely
106	neg	There are too many other things I want to say about this product, but overall, and being a lifelong fan of Logitech, I'm more than disappointed
106	neg	This is the second g502 Hero I've bought (the one I bought from Amazon was New/Unused) and to be quite honest I'd rather go through another company than deal with these issues anymore
106	neg	I won't be using their "gaming" mice ever again
107	pos	Someone said this is too heavy
107	pos	I don't think it is
107	pos	It's lighter than my old gaming mouse that broke
107	pos	It has too many buttons and some are near the primary ones
107	pos	You have to be careful how you hold your hand or you find yourself changing your sensitivity by accident
107	pos	Logitech's cancerous G-Hub program is required to set it up initially, but once you set the onboard memory it will work without it
107	pos	G-Hub did not work on Win 7 for me, and there's no Linux support
107	pos	You will need Windows 8+ to configure it
107	pos	I feel we're going backwards in technology and user experience here
108	pos	About a year ago I decided to get back to PC gaming
108	pos	I had started streaming and after mostly PS4 content with an underwhelming laptop to boot, I upgraded to a desktop last year which came with a good “gaming mouse”
108	pos	It was comfortable to use so I never put much thought into it
108	pos	About a month ago I decided to look around for a mouse though to see if it was even worth upgrading, talked to a few friends and they all recommended the G502
108	pos	I’ve known the Logitech brand for quite a few years and have used their cheaper wireless mice for my laptop so figured I’d give this one a shot
108	pos	And holy cow is this an awesome mouse
108	pos	The customization features in the Logitech Software alone is super easy to use and make adjustments for later
108	pos	Set different levels of sensitivity for my needs, set up the extra mouse buttons for different purposes in different games
108	pos	I’m still struggling to adjust to a mouse and keyboard after having a controller in my hands for almost three decades, this mouse has greatly assisted in my transition into the PC world
108	pos	Console gamers looking to dive into PC, give this mouse a shot, it has enough customization options to fit just about anyone’s needs
109	pos	I have/was a Razer fanboy for years
109	pos	Unfortunately razer products have started to go downhill & any support has become virtually laughable if best
109	pos	This isn't a crap on razer review but more a "thank god I found an alternative"
109	pos	When switching from my 3rd razer death adder to my first logitech G502, I immediately felt "comfortable"
109	pos	Added weights gave me the feel I wanted
109	pos	The ergonomics felt right, & the mouse overall just WORKED
109	pos	I am a huge fan if the scroll wheel now also & the fact that you can set it to both standard & infinite scroll is a nice touch
109	pos	Been several months now & I think it's time I make the complete jump for the rest of my products
109	pos	My current keyboard now randomly changes audio & phantom types keys from time to time
109	pos	Not something you want while gaming
110	pos	This is an extremely precise and reliable mouse, both with movement and scroll wheel
110	pos	The only annoying thing about it is the non-adjustable "thunk" of the scroll wheel, it's too "notchy"
110	pos	You can engage/disengage that notch, but:- if you disengage it, the scroll wheel becomes too sensitive, the slightest touch and it scrolls
110	pos	- if you engage it, the scroll wheel has a super annoying "thunk" every time you turn the mouse wheel
110	pos	becomes extremely precise, but super annoying (feel and sound)Tried the MX3 before this one -> the MX3 was better built, had a better scroll wheel feel, but was glitchy every so often (the scroll wheel was precise only ~99% of the time, couldn't find a way to get rid of that glitchiness in their "Logi Options" software, tried all possible settings/sensitivity)
110	pos	In the end, I went with the razer basilisk -> extremely precise, scroll wheel sensitivity can be adjusted with a knob under the mouse (no software needed
110	pos	- I hate having to install mouse/keyboard software, for any reason)
111	pos	This is competing with the g300s for my favorite mouse
111	pos	Buttons: It has enough buttons to assign several functions to them in games without going overboard
111	pos	I really wanted a mouse with extra buttons directly adjacent to the M1 or M2 button like the g300s had and this one has two next to the M1 button and a couple of thumb buttons
111	pos	Weight: Medium to heavy depending on weights added
111	pos	There is a hinged magnetic "door" on the bottom of the mouse that makes it extremely easy to adjust the weight of the mouse on a whim
111	pos	My g300s was ultra lightweight, which made flick shots extremely easy but glidey tracking wasn't perfectly smooth
111	pos	This one glides extremely well and flicks well with the weights taken out
111	pos	Adding too much weight can cause overshoot or a kind of rubber banding effect when I throw my hand quickly, but more weight feels like it has easier gliding and tracking
111	pos	Features: This has things like profile shifting and a temporary dpi shift "sniper" button but I never use those
111	pos	It does have a scroll wheel lock and unlock button that lets you choose between the clicky single line scrolling or the friction free high speed scrolling, which I change all the time as needed
111	pos	Usually for browsing
111	pos	Software: Let's you change your lights, button assignments, make macros, etc
111	pos	The usual
111	pos	Cons: The only minor con is that the scroll wheel very slightly jiggles when flicking the mouse quickly
111	pos	It has never caused me problems, but I can feel it when it happens
111	pos	I fixed it by using a thin nylon washer with a slit cut in it so I could lower it on the "axle" the scroll wheel is attached to
111	pos	The jiggle was nearly eliminated and the friction free scrolling still works fine
112	pos	I really wanted to love this mouse
112	pos	I am a casual gamer, and I thought this would up my game a bit with precision and programmable buttons, etc
112	pos	Sadly, after using it for an afternoon, I found to be a poor choice for me
112	pos	Pros:-The smoothness of the sensing is excellent
112	pos	I felt my ability to pick precise targets in shooting scenarios would be enhanced compared to my old Microsoft mouse
112	pos	-The ability to switch the scroll button to free-wheeling is handy and satisfying
112	pos	-Materials do seem to be nice and solid
112	pos	-The weights are a nice touch for customizability
112	pos	-The lights add visual appeal without being too flashy
112	pos	Colors are customizeable
112	pos	-The quantity of buttons available is good, and their locations are easily accessible by fingers without accidental touches just from gripping the mouse itself
112	pos	-The sliding surfaces on the bottom are smooth and large
112	pos	-The feel in my larger than average hands was nice
112	pos	Ergonomics were good compared to a more standard shape
112	pos	-The thumb button for engaging low DPI would be good if I could get used to it
112	pos	-The multiple profiles available for single or multiple customized DPI & programmed button settings is nice
112	pos	Cons:-There's too much resistance on the scroll wheel when free-wheeling is disengaged
112	pos	When my fingers were dry, they would actually slip on the metal wheel surface instead of rolling it
112	pos	-The left/right bump buttons on the scroll wheel are easy to press, but the center scroll button is hard to press
112	pos	I found it very difficult to consistently press only the center scroll button
112	pos	Most of the time I was accidentally pressing down and left or right at the same time
112	pos	-My habit of wedging my thumb against the mouse pad and mouse for extra precision is not possible with this mouse due to the ergonomic wing shape on the left side
112	pos	I found this highly annoying, and it made it harder for me to hit targets
112	pos	If I could get used to toggling the DPI on the fly, this might be ok, but for $50 I don't want to work that hard to love it
113	neg	I don't write reviews much but look another way for a gaming mouse
113	neg	The left click works when it wants too
113	neg	I play FPS shooters and much other games, but the clicks have been giving me issues
113	neg	When ADS in FPS shooters, it's like the mouse is in rapid fire or its to sensitive with clicks and acts like a double or triple click and this is really annoying in gaming or even casual use as when you try to drag and drop or click on a folder or app it will double or triple click most of the time
113	neg	I would've returned it but its been sometime
113	neg	Not sure if I would get another Logitech mouse as I've been let down twice already
113	neg	The other products they make are great but the mice in my experience are terrible
114	neg	I just wanted a simple mouse for a cheap price but I guess you get what you pay for
114	neg	I’ve had good luck with Logitech products in the past so I figured this mouse would be decent
114	neg	There’s not a lot of good, long-lasting gaming mice on the market anymore and I was worried about spending too much just to have them stop working in a couple months
114	neg	This one was great at first and appeared to work just right, and didn’t give me the dreaded double-click issue I had with previous gaming mice but after a month, the cursor started to do its own thing
114	neg	It would randomly drag itself across the screen and freeze and I’d have to unplug and re-plug-in the mouse to my computer in order for it to start up again
114	neg	Super annoying after the first two or three times and it began doing it more often as time went on
114	neg	I thought it was a computer issue but it did the same thing on other devices
114	neg	I ended up getting a different mouse recently
114	neg	This one is not worth buying
115	neg	G502 Hero Mouse from Logitech, Review
115	neg	I've been buying the "Inferior", non-"sick
115	neg	" G300s several years
115	neg	I've owned owned a total of three G300's
115	neg	Even though the G300s physically decay like cake in the rain, I strongly recommend buying a G300s instead of this G502 piece of absolute garbage
115	neg	LET ME EXPLAIN:To start, the Hand-Feel for me is really bad, and I usually end up holding it in a way that makes reaching two of the Thumb buttons very awkward
115	neg	I normally get Ambidextrous mice , so that's my fault
115	neg	And really, it's also my fault for having strange hands
115	neg	But that's not what makes the G502 the worst mouse I've touched in over a decade
115	neg	NEGATIVES:What is NOT my fault is the overly sensitive Click Pressure on all the face and side buttons
115	neg	I don't know if that's an intended feature, or I just got mouse from a lot that was over-tuned
115	neg	But it's far too easy to accidentally click when sliding the mouse across the pad
115	neg	ANY resistance from your surface and CLICK
115	neg	Glance any part of a button that isn't the exact center: CLICK
115	neg	Gently feel for where the buttons are in the dark, while being careful to use far less force than should reasonably be needed to depress a button far enough to engage the mechanism : CLICK
115	neg	CLICKCLICK
115	neg	CLICK
115	neg	MORE NEGATIVES:The Mouse Wheel has to be some cruel experiment in psychological warfare
115	neg	The Lock/Unlock implementation warrants detailed comment in both states
115	neg	Beyond the fact that it is an unwanted feature at the best of times -- when gaming, it will actively hinder your enjoyment and performance -- unless you dedicate your life mastering it, and I have no intention of doing anything remotely close to that
115	neg	* As a free spinning wheel, it fails due to floatiness
115	neg	Unless you just want to rip-scroll through several pages of product reviews on Amazon to record for a video project, it has no use case that is superior to any other scrolling function available to users, and that includes the Middle Mouse Button scrolling that the mouse still possesses (I'll get to MMB issues later)
115	neg	* As a tick wheel, it FAILS because the ratchet is far too loose to be trusted
115	neg	You get this awful effect where physically, the wheel will "back rock" or fore rock" to cradle itself between the teeth
115	neg	This then causes your scroll selection to tick up or down onto something other than your intent
115	neg	Not always, mind you
115	neg	But enough (and unpredictably so) to seriously impede, if not, ruin whatever gaming moment you might have been having
115	neg	Further exacerbating the issue is you cannot change the internal DPI of the mouse wheel sensor
115	neg	Not with your OS, not with G HUB, not with ANYTHING
115	neg	You can only change how your Operating System MULTIPLIES the Wheel Motion
115	neg	And even with a 1:1 multiple, you get that selection rocking issue
115	neg	And anything LESS than 1:1 results in no scrolling whatsoever unless you unlock and rip-scroll
115	neg	MOAR NEGATIVES:Oh and this is all before the issues of trying to get a clean Click out of the Middle Mouse Button buried under this infernal, Chroenburgian assembly
115	neg	It feels like trying to command a Two year old into behaving, using only soft verbal warnings, while sliding supine across a frozen lake, while also being used as hockey puck by competing teams of various drunken Canadian bears and moosen
115	neg	This would be an absolutely great mouse to lend to your competition
115	neg	if this was the design intent, hat's off to ya
115	neg	But, to put everything I've said even more viscerally
115	neg	I want to rip the wheel out of the mouse with my teeth and grind it until my gums bleed
115	neg	It's rare that I'm passionate at all about a design feature
115	neg	But this wheel, I HATE IT
115	neg	I want the person who designed it to feel as bad about making it, as I do trying to use it
115	neg	NEVER REVISIT THIS DESIGN EVER AGAIN
115	neg	You just don't get it
115	neg	It literally adds a layer of anxiety and distrust to EVERY SINGLE THING done with this mouse
115	neg	Even the tasks that have nothing to do with scrolling at all
115	neg	The fact that you know this boobytrap is a centimeter from your finger is all it takes
115	neg	Oh yeah
115	neg	AND IT'S LOUD
115	neg	It doesn't even have the common courtesy to make a satisfying noise
115	neg	NO
115	neg	Shifting a from 4th Gear to Reverse at Highway speed in your uncle's rustbucket Camaro is less audibly jarring
115	neg	POSITIVES:The software is actually fairly good
115	neg	With the caveat that you cannot change the Wheel DPI nor the Wheel Up/Down command assignments (wth
115	neg	)
115	neg	The Motion is spot on, but that's baseline expectation for a +$50 MouseAnd the Weight system is a fine option, even if I'm most comfortable taking all the wrights AND THE DOOR off
115	neg	CONCLUSION:The G502, in my humble opinion (at least THIS one I personally received) may as well be eWaste
115	neg	I genuinely tried "Getting Used to It"
115	neg	I gave the thing several months
115	neg	But as a result, I can no longer return it
115	neg	Seriously, Logitech
115	neg	If you would just use the G502's Software, Motion Sensor and Moulded Plastic Quality for the next iteration of the G300s series: I'd buy that day one
115	neg	Give the next G300s a SOLID wheel with a strong ratchet and Side-Pivot lateral scrolling
115	neg	You could even toss in a Thumb Toggle/Switch for DPI shifting or whatever
115	neg	All these things have mechanically solid examples in your other products
115	neg	Paint the dang thing Gold, charge $80, and call it the "G399gg Great Golden Calf Edition"
115	neg	I don't care
115	neg	Just stop with these ridiculously over-designed "srz gam3r" fad features
115	neg	YOU
115	neg	ARE
115	neg	NOT
115	neg	RAZER
115	neg	YOU
115	neg	SHOULD
115	neg	BE
115	neg	BETTER
115	neg	THAN
115	neg	RAZER
115	neg	PS
115	neg	I purchased this mouse via a recommendation from a friend
115	neg	Whom (upon finding out only too late) never uses the mouse wheel, extra buttons or G HUB
115	neg	So yeah, 5-Stars if you just want an overpriced 2-button Mouse
116	pos	Good well made mouse
116	pos	Packaging and shipping was excellent
116	pos	I had to give this mouse away though because it is just too large and uncomfortable for my hand size
116	pos	I also would prefer more buttons
116	pos	Size :I found the back of my hands hurting after using the mouse
116	pos	The "hump" or curve of the mouse seems high, making it a reach for the far left side button (default aim)
116	pos	This means I likely would not use it, bringing the amount of extra buttons down (at least for me)
116	pos	Although, my fingers did seem to automatically find the perfectly located middle back button
116	pos	I never once hit the front middle accidentally
116	pos	Perhaps because one button was too far and just the sheer size of the mouse, i did find that my fingers would sort of expect the four left buttons to be far as well, causing me reach further then they actually were and mis-press
116	pos	To be clear, those four and the middle back buttons are perfectly located so this is just me
116	pos	Buttons:The amount they state does not include the middle front button which serves as the switch for your scroll wheel (either free rolling or click
116	pos	both are great
116	pos	)
116	pos	While I like the option to choose this, I world have prefered having another mappable middle button like my current device
116	pos	Two of the mappable buttons are your scroll wheel left and right tilt
116	pos	This is cool but I felt it would have been better with more noticeable feedback like a soft click
116	pos	The wheel felt almost loose and I am curious if I would have ended up mistakenly clicking to the left or right while trying to just middle click
116	pos	I honestly think I wouldnt and it's just a matter of the user to get used to it
116	pos	Overall, a cool looking and good quality mouse with a few expertly placed buttons
116	pos	Just a bit too large and would have liked more buttons since one of them becomes semi unreachable
117	neg	**Updated review**Amazon replaced the mouse because Logitech was being difficult about honoring their warranty
117	neg	So the 2nd mouse had the same software issue as the original review but I had found a work around for the custom key assignments by using registry edits to let the mouse work with the older software
117	neg	Unfortunately this 2nd mouse has now developed the double click problem that many Logitech mice are prone to because they use cheap micro switches for the clicking mechanism
117	neg	Honestly I'm just going to switch to a different brand that uses better switches even though I've been using Logitech mice for over 20 years
117	neg	**Original review**I upgraded from an old G502 spectrum to this mouse
117	neg	FIrst of all the good things, it's of good quality construction and fits extremely well in my hand
117	neg	It slides fairly smoothly over my mouse pad and overall it's a pleasure to use
117	neg	The bad
117	neg	It is not compatible with Logitech Gaming Software and instead needs to be used with G-HUB in order to customize it's settings
117	neg	G-HUB is
117	neg	not so good
117	neg	G-HUB prevents the left/right wheel click from continuous horizontal scrolling like I could with the G502 Spectrum on LGS
117	neg	(not to be confused with the vertical scroll wheel)I can't assign custom key assignments to the mouse while using onboard-memory mode, it only works when onboard-memory is not turned on
117	neg	You can create a custom profile and then assign it to one of the 5 memory slots, but custom key assignments are for some reason not saved and/or applied
117	neg	What's the point of allowing 5 custom on-the-fly profiles to be assigned if they are not going to let you use custom key assignments
117	neg	It's one of the main features if the mouse that simply won't work because G-HUB doesn't work properly
117	neg	Logitech should enable compatibility with LGS or fix G-HUB
117	neg	Honestly I wish I could just get my money back
118	neg	Here's the bottom line for this mouse
118	neg	It's got average ergonomics, above average buttons and placement, but is spoiled by the terrible Logitech GHub software
118	neg	This mouse doesn't have any onboard memory, which means the Logitech software *has* to be running at all times for you to use anything but the basic functions
118	neg	If it closes on you (which
118	neg	it will), you immediately lose any functions you've set on those extra keys until you reopen the software
118	neg	I use this mouse on both my Mac and PC
118	neg	The interface is poorly designed, and I've yet to have it detect different games when they run on my PC
118	neg	The Mac software has even reset itself a couple times in the 3 weeks I've had it, meaning I have to go back and remap everything, reset the mouse speed, etc
118	neg	Also beware, Little Snitch shows that the G Hub software does phone home to Logitech
118	neg	You can't be sure what it's sending back and forth, especially when you're required to give it full access to your machine for it to function
118	neg	To cap it off, Logitech has *specifically* designed the extra buttons on this mouse so that they cannot be detected by any software other than G Hub
118	neg	Typically you could use an alternative like USB Overdrive or Steermouse on Mac to map buttons, but that's not an option
118	neg	To be clear, that is a deliberate design choice by Logitech to lock you in to their awful software
118	neg	I'd strongly recommend looking elsewhere for a mouse
119	pos	I got this mouse to replace my Razor Naga and my Predator(buttons quit working) for FPS
119	pos	My favorite aspect of the mouse is the adjustable weight
119	pos	i like my mouse to be heavier and i was pleasantly surprised that it came with quite a bit of weight i could add to it and make it the perfect weight
119	pos	The RGB lighting customization for the mouse is great and the software is super easy to use and that's where you can set your custom DPI and use the button on the mouse to quickly switch between the settings
119	pos	The one thing I don't like about the mouse that I've gotten used to is the size, my hand dwarfs this mouse
119	pos	Don't get me wrong its a decent size mouse but i have rather large hands so it was an adjustment but now after about 2 months of using it it feels natural and works great
119	pos	I would recommend this mouse to someone who is looking for a good FPS mouse that wont break the bank
119	pos	Fast forward 9 months the thing quit working
119	pos	Took it apart and the right click switch metal piece had broke and won't work anymore
119	pos	That little metal piece bricked the whole mouse
120	pos	I bought this mouse knowing about the double clicking problems plaguing Logitech mice
120	pos	Whether I come to regret this remains to be seen
120	pos	That said, I purchased the protection plan since everything I have heard about this mouse lead me to believe that it will fail within a few years
120	pos	Design flaws/QC defects aside, I really like this mouse so far
120	pos	It has a bunch of features not present on other mice, like the infinite scroll wheel, left and right scroll buttons on the scroll wheel, programmable profiles, and the button to temporarily change between DPI settings within a profile when held
120	pos	I'm not terribly keen on the shape of the mouse, but I'm getting used to it
120	pos	I don't like the nylon braiding on the wire
120	pos	I liked the cloth braided wires on older mice better
120	pos	Yes, they were prone to kinking over time, but that's just my personal preference in the end
120	pos	The customization software is fairly simple, but some features are easier to adjust than others
120	pos	No documentation on the software in the included instructions, but it's easy to figure out how to use it given a bit of time
120	pos	If it wasn't for the double clicking issues plaguing these mice I would say this is a solid 4
120	pos	5-5 star product, but knowing how widespread they are I'm giving this a 4 star rating instead
120	pos	This review is based on my experience so far
120	pos	If the mouse fails I will return and revise this review along with information on the RMA process
121	neg	EDIT: Beyond the minor difficulties in my original post, the software this comes with doesn't switch profiles when you're playing a game
121	neg	After spending an hour on Reddit trying every suggested fix, none of them have worked - it always reverts instantly to the default "Desktop" profile
121	neg	Really regret buying this mouse, should have stuck with Corsair
121	neg	It's a great mouse, a 5-star mouse, except for how loud the scroll wheel is
121	neg	I can't tell if I got an especially loud one, or if other people just don't notice the noise, or what, because every time I use the scroll wheel it's SO loud that I'm debating whether to keep using this mouse or not
121	neg	Hoping it'll get quieter over time because it really is a great mouse otherwise
121	neg	Just so, so, so very loud
121	neg	(You can switch between regular scroll and hyper scroll, and hyper scroll is totally silent, but it's also far too imprecise for me to use for most things
121	neg	If you're only looking for hyper scroll the noise wouldn't be an issue at all
121	neg	)
122	pos	A fine mouse it is with a lot of very nice settings and profiles that i find to work nicely
122	pos	I do think the sides are a bit slicker than i would prefer and if stickier/grippier might help with the narrowness
122	pos	As a fella with wider hands I find it to be a bit narrow with my pinky and other finger dragging the mat and I find it to be pretty low profile
122	pos	I think if you had smaller hands or likes a thinner and low profile mouse this is perfect
122	pos	If you have bigger hands and want a larger mouse I would look at the Anker precision gaming mouse, I will get another to replace my older one and give this nice mouse to my wife or daughter
122	pos	I like this mouse alot just wish they had an XL version
122	pos	BTW, the mouse wheel does not break it has a button to click rotate or free fly
123	neg	EDIT2 10/23: drifting has become way more noticeable
123	neg	This for MSRP of $80 is ridiculous
123	neg	Usually go Logitech, but it's time to try other miceEDIT: I thought I was going crazy, but my mouse has begun to drift on its own
123	neg	It's been getting worse and worse
123	neg	I don't even use this for gaming really so the durability is questionable
123	neg	I love the G602 and, besides the wireless version of the G502, the G502 wired is the closest thing to the G602
123	neg	The mouse clicks feel nice and sound quiet just like the G602
123	neg	The build quality is great and it doesn't feel cheap
123	neg	However, my biggest complaint about this mouse is that it does not have the same amount programmable buttons the G602 had
123	neg	It's a step backwards from the G602 in this regard and it would be amazing if more buttons were positioned on the left side of the mouse like the G602
124	pos	tl;dr: I have big hands, the mouse is too tapered for my palm grip and is uncomfortable
124	pos	This mouse is better for claw grips
124	pos	It's a cool mouse, but not for me
124	pos	If only the back end was thicccc enough or my palm
124	pos	I have large hands and from a diagram I was researching it was supposed to be one of the more larger sized mice
124	pos	7
124	pos	5" (~19cm) Middle to Base of Palm x 4" (~10cm) across (from the base pinky joint to index joint)
124	pos	I bought this to replace my Razer Death Adder which is far more comfortable
124	pos	I thought the Hero 502 felt narrow
124	pos	Hero 502 measures ~60mm across as the gripping area, but so does the Death Adder
124	pos	I think the problem is attributed to to the narrow tapering base where your palm sits
124	pos	On the 502 Hero, there is only about ~60mm in diameter at the base, but it's tapered so much near the top, there is almost nowhere for your palm to sit on
124	pos	(I like my palm grip when I'm aiming with my arm
124	pos	)
124	pos	In Comparison with the Death Adder at around ~73cm in diameter, my palm sits comfortably
124	pos	I've had a couple Razer products and I want to go try other things now
124	pos	The current DE Chroma, somethings are wearing off/out
124	pos	So it's time for a new mouse
124	pos	Nitpicks: The scroll wheel is more like a flywheel
124	pos	I don't want that much momentum when I flick that wheel around
124	pos	I do like the idea of tilting the wheel, cool feature
124	pos	Another nitpick is Ghub, I'm not familiar with it, but it did take a while for me to set up the DPI
124	pos	And man that was down a couple of rabbit holes
124	pos	I didn't realize GHUB had profiles for each game you had (Which can be a cool thing, but I was hoping the Desktop default was the global set for everything unless you manually change a profile for a game
124	pos	Last nitpick about GHUB, if you have a library of games, you have to keep clicking over this long horizontal list of icons
124	pos	Come on, why can't we set these to tiles of some sort
124	pos	Or just a line by line list of games
124	pos	Or a choice between all three
125	pos	PROS-Cool lights-Fits ergonomically, with adjustable weights-Lots of customizeable buttons
125	pos	For editing, I use a lot of Ctrl functions like Ctrl C, CtrlV, CtrlZ, and CtrlS, so making them each one click streamlines things a great deal
125	pos	CONS- Software is very glitchy and bloated
125	pos	Takes up a lot of memory just to assign a few buttons
125	pos	Sometimes the button assigns just reset to factory after a while
125	pos	Had to reinstall it
125	pos	-The mouse wheel is one of those free-spinning ones that you can either spin like a fidget spinner or lock into a more traditional motion
125	pos	After two months of web-browsing use, the scrolling action no longer registers accurately
125	pos	Clicking with the wheel works, but scrolling up and down has about a 20% success rate
126	neg	My proteus g502 started doing the dreaded double click after a few years so I pulled the trigger on this new "HERO" version of the g502
126	neg	I didn't know it at the time but if you buy a mouse with one of these new "HERO" sensors you will no longer be able to use the sensor/surface calibration that comes with LGS
126	neg	Logitech claims that this new "HERO" sensor does surface calibration on the fly and thus you can no longer manually calibrate it
126	neg	I've been using the mouse for about 24 hours now and its almost completely unusable even for regular web browsing, constant stuttering and deadspots
126	neg	I am using a good quality black neoprene mouse pad with a clean surface
126	neg	My g502 proteus used to do this as well but a quick surface tuning would easily resolve the problem for 6-12 months
126	neg	I found a tip online to uninstall the virtual mouse driver and reboot, this seems to have worked for a few hours but now the problems are back again
126	neg	Don't buy this "HERO" version, get the proteus version if you want a g502 (which is now twice as expensive as this mouse and more expensive than it used to be - gee i wonder why)
127	pos	I've used Logitech Mice for several years now
127	pos	I lost my old Logitech Mouse in my move to another state and I needed a replacement I bought the wireless lightspeed mouse
127	pos	It started having double clicking issues, and I ended up chucking it
127	pos	I decided to go with the standard wired mouse, and I saw the Logitech G502 Gaming mouse with the hero sensor
127	pos	It was cheap so I bought it

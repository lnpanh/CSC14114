144	neg	Your grapple hook just went out because your mouse registered two clicks instead of one, and now the cooldown is causing you to fall to your death
145	neg	Going on 45 days now, 14 emails, a tracking number where nothing has shipped and multiple attempts to resolve a warranty claim, as usual, Logitech simply ignores you as user once they run of excuses in their agent script-book
145	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again
146	neg	I bought this on sale and I'll buy Logitech over the flashy garbage that Razer puts out for gamers any day
146	neg	I decided to move on from the Corsair mouse I liked after I went through two in 4 years
146	neg	When a mouse is ~$100 it shouldn't break from moderate use
146	neg	I was looking for something that felt nice and I could stand it breaking in the next two years
146	pos	The weight adjustment is a nice feature, and the handful of programmable buttons is great
146	pos	I use various macros or prefer to have some oft-used keys on in reach of my thumb quite a bit
146	pos	The G Hub software is easy to use, so getting all set up the way I wanted took less than 20 minutes
146	pos	After I read another review after thinking the scroll wheel just sucked, I was very satisfied
146	pos	I initially thought there was no tactile feedback to the wheel, but there was a button for it
146	pos	It must have come in one position, or I accidentally hit it, but once I clicked it everything felt great
146	neg	My only other issue is I keep accidentally pushing the DPI shift button at the tip of my thumb consistently
146	neg	I can get used to it and adjust, but it's enough to prevent a full five stars
147	neg	The first thing that I thought when I first used the mouse is it's narrow profile, which is much too narrow for the average man's hands, leaving your pinky and ring finger dragging on the desk or struggling to find room to grip the mouse
147	neg	The RGB LEDs are not all that impressive because only two parts of the mouse light up
147	neg	) Another quirk: this mouse is strongly magnetic at the bottom which causes it to stick somewhat to my stainless steel desk
148	pos	It feels great, nostalgic for Proteus Core users and of course with the extra DPI range can make gaming rather engaging albeit a little bit
148	pos	For the time being, I enjoy it and would be open to see what else Logitech would do to top it off
148	neg	UPDATE: So a notable error has occurred that I felt should be brought up to which I have not found a "reliable" solution to yet
148	neg	DO NOT PURCHASE THISUnless you're willing to adapt to its faults
149	neg	The media could not be loaded
149	pos	So far the 502 is living up to the high logitech standards I'm used to
149	neg	I needed a replacement for my old G402, the left button switch was randomly double clicking on single press
149	pos	Just like the 402, the 502 Hero is good for people with larger hands
149	pos	The buttons schemes are almost identical which made the transition to the 502 seamless
149	pos	The shape of the mouse is comfortable and easy to get used to
149	neg	One thing I'm a little apprehensive about is the scroll wheel
149	neg	It rattles around and seems to shake the entire mouse when scrolling in regular mode, not hyperfast mode (free spin)
149	neg	I'll update if it gets worse
149	pos	The feet seem good it glides across my mousepad with ease
149	pos	There is slightly more friction than my old 402, but that may just be because it's not broken in yet
149	pos	All in all it seems like a good buy, but if you get it on sale then it's almost a MUST buy
149	pos	There are enough features for the hard core gamer and it's easy and comfortable enough to use for the average gamer
150	neg	Be aware that the double click issue may not be the hardware, other words the internal micro switch
151	pos	I wasn’t sure if I’d like the DPI shift button or not, and figured I’d just re-bind it to another function, but I actually like it
151	pos	I wish this had one more thumb button, as I tend to bind this to the “inventory” of the games I play
151	pos	The cable is super flexible, so it doesn’t “spring” the mouse when you let go of it, like my old mouse occasionally did
151	pos	The mouse has a decent weight to it without using the supplied weights, but that’s personal preference
151	neg	The mode wheel is a little too stiff for my liking, it really ka-chunk ka-chunks into the detents
151	pos	I have rather large hands and it fits nice in my hand
151	pos	All of the buttons are reachable for me
152	pos	Bought this mouse in hopes to use it and program it for gaming
152	neg	Turns out the onboard memory cannot be programmed for macros or most other useful functions
152	neg	These functions are only available if you have G Hub open at ALL TIMES, which is very annoying
152	neg	This means if you do not have G Hub installed on any of the devices you plan on using this with, it will only do the basic functions of a mouse
152	neg	I tried calling support only to find myself talking to someone who barely spoke English, and he couldn’t give me a good answer on why I can’t program a macro onto my mouse
152	neg	Unless Logitech is able to fix this with an update, I would not recommend this mouse to anyone
153	neg	Low quality materials
153	neg	The wheel barely lasted a month and is now a weighted fly wheel
153	neg	So you end up just unintentionally increasing the DPI setting to ridiculously high settings forcing you to somehow open the utility to fix it
153	neg	Yeah, the software sucks too
153	pos	The only thing decent about this is the magnetic bottom
154	pos	This mouse is super comfortable and fit my hand very well
154	neg	Problem is the main right button was very finicky
154	neg	I need to right click and hold the button for my games to aim and it the mouse would act like I wasn't holding the button down
154	neg	I'd click and hold and it would act like I just clicked sometimes id have to click and hold 2,3,4,5 times before it would work right and let me aim
154	pos	The only fix I could find was to pull the button up gently and then press it back down hard and that fixed it for a while
154	neg	But it started doing it again a few weeks later and while trying to fix it myself again it finally broke
154	neg	Definitely not happy with it and even less pleased with logitechs lack of customer service
154	neg	Definitely won't be buying any more of their products
155	pos	I've purchased Logitech products since the 90s and have been an avid game, and they are always known for having top quality egonomics
155	neg	The g502 does not meet my expectations in for a daily use nor gaming mouse
155	neg	I have small hands, and this mouse is actually too small for my palm that i'm actually squeezing my fingers to grip the mouse--this will be an even bigger issue for larger hands
155	neg	Secondly, they sacrificed comfort and ergonomics and tried to make it look futuristic and stylish
155	neg	They put an a steeper incline at the index finger, which is not the correct shape for your hands
155	neg	Also the scroll wheel on free mode is unusable, and on click mode is very clunky and inaccurate
155	neg	It's a very cheap and inaccurate wheel to control, and their gaming software gives no options to change this
156	neg	Update: My prior Chinese manufactured G502 Hero died on me after I dropped it a few too many times
156	pos	Other than the failure of the prior G502 Mouse I had purchased, this mouse is the best I have used to this date
156	pos	I hope it doesn't spontaneously burn out after the warranty period ends
156	pos	This mouse was fantastic
156	neg	After owning this mouse for a total of two months, it is no longer fantastic
156	neg	The mouse died on me without explanation
156	neg	There is no conceivable reason for it having done so
156	neg	It just suddenly connected and disconnected to my PC randomly before refusing to connect or power on ever again
156	neg	This one does not work anymore
156	neg	And, unfortunately, it died before I could return it
156	neg	The lights on the mouse were erratic and not working properly
156	neg	The mouse connected for a few minutes but the laser tracker was not functioning on the bottom of the mouse
156	neg	The problem was with the G502 Hero mouse that suddenly died after I unplugged it the first time to try another port
156	neg	It never turned on again and remained disconnected
156	neg	Something short-circuited inside the mouse; it is a hardware issue
157	pos	The good: the mouse fits my hand quite well, and it glides very nicely
157	neg	The bad: the mouse buttons take almost no effort to click - maybe half the effort compared to G602, so I end up clicking both buttons instead of one pretty often
157	neg	Also, although I like being able to switch between the clicky and smooth motion of the wheel, the clicky mode is too loud, much louder than G602
157	neg	Bottom line, I am returning this one and will look for something that fits my needs better
158	pos	It is fantastik
158	pos	It is very responsive
158	pos	I love the left thumb button on the G502 which the G700 did not have
158	pos	It is a great mouse
159	neg	Missing a foot, right button barely registers the click
159	pos	It's a little smaller than the old one, but fits my hand better, even though I have big hands
159	pos	I love the feel of the body, Very smooth
159	pos	The response of the mouse is fantastic, but I still am learning what setting to use
159	pos	Also getting use to the wheel, definitely a different feel from the old one
159	pos	Over-all I believe this was a good buy - I actually got this here at a really good discount
159	pos	I recommend this for the casual gamer - I have to try it with a FPS soon
160	neg	The replacement mouse has four pads/feet on the bottom, whereas the initial mouse only has three—it’s missing the thin pad right below the G502 Hero logo
160	neg	But here’s the kicker: the pad on the replacement mouse was misaligned and sticking up at its smallest point
160	neg	The G502 Hero is a great mouse design, but unfortunately I’m not convinced it’ll last very long
161	neg	I have been through 3 of these G502 mice in the last year and a half
161	neg	All of them suffer from defective clickers
161	neg	The left and right mouse buttons will often extra click, when you only want to click once
161	neg	This is such a common problem for G502's that it has turned into a JOKE
161	neg	Logitech should be ashamed of their disgusting product reliability
161	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again, I am moving over to Corsair for everything
161	neg	Stay away from Logitech products, you have been warned
162	pos	I initially liked the mouse
162	neg	At times, when I held down the button it would send random click up and down events
162	neg	If I pressed harder they would often stop so it was obvious that the switch was malfunctioning
163	neg	It's extremely cheap plastic, I feel like this thing is going to break in my hands, I found myself treating it like a priceless artifact
163	neg	The buttons move around and feel and sound so cheap, just that typical cheap plastic sound you get from toys at the Dollar Store
163	neg	The weights don't fit well inside the mouse, I picked up the mouse to move it and the cheap bottom feel out as well as two weights
163	neg	I'd had enough of this mouse after a night's worth of gaming when the adhesive at the top used to promote frictionless movement started to peel off and scratch my mouse pad
163	neg	I'm speechless, I'm not sure how this could be one of the most sold gaming mice on the market
164	neg	It was fantastic while it worked, but I have to dock two stars for not even lasting 2 years
165	neg	Right mouse button randomly sticks or feels like a "short throw" and doesn't fully engage
165	neg	It's damn frustrating for a mouse that costs this much
165	neg	The "shift" button doesn't get much use, it's rather awkward and nearly pointless
165	neg	Logitech, you've lost another loyal, disappointed customer
166	pos	Day 1 review, so just my initial impressions
166	pos	Pluses: Build quality, weight, button feel are all on point
166	pos	Tracking seems accurate
166	neg	Weight is almost too much, even without the (seemingly) unnecessary extra weights (included) that you can install
166	pos	The 'thumb rest' (for right handed people anyway) is weird, though I think with more use it will be fine, maybe even a nice plus
166	neg	Misses:  The mouse wheel
166	neg	It has no other texture, isn't rubberized or textured in a way that helps prevent slippage
166	pos	It feels too smooth
166	neg	Couple that with the clunky 'speed bump' mechanism and it makes accurately scrolling the wheel difficult at best
166	neg	Definitely not a high performance feature, and honestly it doesn't work particularly well for normal use
166	neg	I'd love to love this, especially at the price point, but the wheel is such a constant issue that I'm not certain if it's something I can get past
167	pos	good mouse and has what most people need
167	neg	mine broke after 3 years but i can see why people put up with it
168	pos	I have to say, it's one of the most ergonomic peripherals I've used, very comfortable
168	pos	The DPI on the fly button is something I'm used to and consider necessary
168	pos	It's pretty good
168	pos	Left and right click are standard, not to tight, not too loose
168	neg	The scroll wheel feels way too loose, regardless of whether the clicker is on or off
168	pos	For the price, it's a great mouse and feels really solid
169	pos	I bought this mouse because a few reviews indicated it was both a quality product and comfortable for people with big hands
169	neg	I wouldn't call it uncomfortable, but there's something about the angle your hand rests that makes certain actions a little awkward, at least for big hands
169	neg	Another problem I have is that the DPI adjustment buttons are constantly being pressed by accident, one way or the other
169	neg	After owning the mouse for about six months, the notorious g502 left-click issues began
169	neg	It was spotty for a little while, but now it can't hold a click at all, making it essentially unusable
170	pos	It's a great mouse, it kills me that the scroll wheel sucks so much
170	pos	It's accurate, the weights system is great, the clicking feels awesome, it has a lot of customizable buttons, all in all it's pretty awesome
170	neg	The scroll wheel is hot garbage
170	pos	It's made of metal, which everyone here seems to love, great, I don't have a problem with that part
170	neg	First issues is that it's SUPER hard to scroll with it, scrolling takes a lot more finger strength than on a regular mouse and that's bad enough, you can turn off the click scrolling for smooth but then you have the problem that it's way too lose
170	neg	The biggest issue I have with it is how insanely sensitive the mouse is when it comes to left and right click on the wheel button
171	pos	This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features
171	pos	The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed
171	pos	Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse
171	pos	With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better
171	pos	The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant
171	neg	ConsRGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand
171	pos	The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well
171	pos	The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons
171	pos	The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate
171	pos	This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse
172	neg	Also, the definition between the buttons are not very defined, and I feel you can easily click the wrong button
173	pos	Overall I'm happy with this mouse
173	pos	It connected easily enough and has a good amount of configurations available with the Logitech software
173	pos	Weights are easy enough to add with a magnetic closure plate to make it sleek
173	neg	Myonly complaint would be for the DPI
174	pos	This mouse was great the soon I got it
174	pos	3 or 4 months pass, no issue
174	neg	6 months, that's when it appears, the double-clicking
174	neg	And it doesn't seem that I'm the one who keeps getting issues, it's a flaw in the construction
174	neg	It's especially frustrating when trying to work and be productive because the double click causes a lot of issues with editing work or creating assignments
174	neg	And when you're gaming, you're at a major disadvantage because it double clicks more in games than in general use
176	pos	I bought a G502 years ago, when the line first launched, and I loved it
176	pos	I used it for hours each day for those years, and I never regretted that purchase
176	neg	However, a few weeks ago the left mouse button started double clicking
176	neg	I tried it with different computers and reset the settings on the mouse but nothing fixed it
176	neg	It seems the switch is dying
176	pos	It is every bit as good as the original
176	neg	My only complaint in all of this is the software
176	neg	I had to recreate my profiles manually, which was a pain, but not enough to detract a star
177	pos	Mouse seems to track well and the g hub software is adequate
177	neg	My main issue with this mouse is how easy it is to accidentally bump the dpi change buttons while gaming
177	neg	Also the tactile feel of the side thumb buttons is not as good as my older G700s
177	pos	The forward and back buttons are smooth and the feel between them is almost indistinguishable
177	neg	I will seek out a better alternative as the inadvertent dpi switching is becoming an issue while gaming
178	pos	This mouse is way more than satisfactory for my preferences, and I am picky about weight, adjustable weights, feet that glide smoothly, supportive software, customization, lighting, scroll wheel functionality, ergonomics, and of course braided cable
178	neg	No brain buy here
179	neg	This thing has been an absolute nightmare since I’ve bought it
179	neg	Holding down the left mouse button and performing things like simple click and drag functions, were close to impossible as the mouse would without warning unclick or register the holding of the mouse as a double click
180	neg	I'm not the only one with this problem it seems, but the switches in this mouse don't hold up to even light gaming
180	neg	I've had it for 3 months minus a day, and already I have lost the ability to click and drag *at all*
180	neg	Overall the left click died far too fast
180	pos	Great ergonomics, great sensor
181	neg	____________________CONS_____________________weight:This mouse is too heavy for actual competitive gaming
181	pos	This mouse's curvature makes it so that in order to get a comfortable grip, your pinky and ring finger are forced to hang off the side and drag on my desk
181	pos	I game a lot with this mouse, and so far it's held up great
181	neg	However, some days the left mouse button (lmb) and right mouse button (rmb) would just stop working properly
181	neg	If holding down the lmb, it would stutter and would stop shooting mid-spray
181	pos	_____________________PROS_____________________extremely customizable:Installing logitech G-hub is little to no hassle, and making macros makes using this mouse extremely fun
181	pos	visually satisfying:it looks sleek and, for lack of a better word, cool
181	pos	cool scroll button:you can toggle it between going by intervals or just flat-out spinning like a wheel
181	pos	Pretty useful for any tasks that require spamming inputs really quickly
181	neg	Point is, the g502 hero is one of the worse mice you can get from logitech
183	neg	When you are scrolling through things it tends to "jump" really far ahead or really far back and it is incredibly annoying
184	pos	I can easily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice gaming or regular mouse with additional comfort
185	pos	The Pros:The mouse itself is well built
185	pos	I love the dual mode scroll wheel as well
185	neg	The Cons:LG Hub software is garbage
185	neg	It installed but would not run on my Win 10 x64 PC
185	neg	I have tried re-installing several times without any success
185	neg	Instructions for the mouse are also quite poor
185	neg	The updated Logitech software is trash though
186	neg	Update: After about 6 months, this mouse has broken in some way that makes it unusable
186	neg	The sensor no longer tracks accurately and something as simple as clicking a link on a web page is nearly impossible due to the random movement it's adding to my motion
187	neg	Within a month my left mouse button developed issues that resulted in clicking when there is no input, clicks not registering when there is input, and double clicking when releasing the button
187	neg	My replacement mouse is already displaying the same symptoms of the first mouse
187	neg	Less than a month in and I get phantom clicks and unintended double clicks
187	neg	If you're looking to buy this for gaming, I recommend you look elsewhere
188	neg	I'm a huge Logitech fan but this one is a failure, pretty much anything with the name HERO from them is a ZERO
189	pos	This mouse has a solid build quality and is comfortable for any grip style
189	neg	The G502 is more on the heavy side for a mouse and I don't see a need to use any of the included weights
189	neg	The mass of this mouse could be an issue for some people, as they may notice some fatigue with constantly moving the mouse around
189	neg	Straightening it was simple enough and getting it to maintain a curve wasn't terribly hard
189	pos	Gaming and general usage so far have been great
189	pos	The sensor seems to work on just about any normal desk surface
190	pos	This is the best gaming mouse I have ever owned
190	pos	I love the software, buttons, and all the cool stuff you can do
190	pos	The top feature for me in particular is the scroll wheel, which with the press of a button lets you scroll freely instead of having it click in steps
190	pos	I can't go to any other mouse now since to my knowledge none have that feature, and makes me wonder why other brands haven't universally adopted the feature
191	pos	A fully programmable mouse with plenty of easy to reach buttons and a fun lighting scheme
191	pos	The embedded software is easy to use and low maintenance
191	pos	The mouse feels great and has simple weights that can be added to increase the heft
191	pos	Lots of buttons that can be programmed for intuitive use
191	neg	1 star off for the DPI buttons being to easy to click in between the left click and the back click
191	neg	So all of a sudden having your mouse speed up or slow down means you need to train yourself as to how you position your fingers
191	pos	Beyond that minor qualm, it's a great gaming mouse
192	neg	i have owned 3 g502 heros in the span of around 8 months with each one having the ending up with the same problem, the right click will begin to freak out; registering several clicks with a single press/hold
192	neg	this makes aiming down sights in games impossible and has remained a consistent issue through out all 3 of the g502 heros I've owned
192	neg	the first one started showing issues 4 months after i bought it
192	neg	same problem, Spazzy right click
192	neg	Spazzy right click
192	neg	honestly i don't really care to buy another mouse, or any product from Logitech going forward
192	neg	it's a shame too, because this used to be a really good mouse
193	pos	I own a lot of 'gaming' mice and this is the best of the bunch, worth every penny
193	neg	Only issues for me is this mouse is bigger than I expected (doesn't work for my wife, who has smaller hands) and I don't like the placement of the buttons by the thumb
193	pos	Other than that this mouse is outstanding
193	pos	Buttery smooth mouse movements
193	pos	I love the programmability of all the buttons, I love the apps, you can adjust settings to a fine level of detail
193	pos	The craftmanship/feel is top-notch
193	pos	There is a huge difference between this mouse and other cheaper gaming mice, definitely worth the price if it's in your budget
194	pos	* The cord is well thought out
194	pos	* Smooth as butter
194	pos	* Not just great for gaming, but also great for photo editing
194	pos	I'm always doing very tiny meticulous details & no other mouse has been good for that except this one
195	pos	The mouse itself is okay
195	neg	But the LED for the logo which you can change doesn't show pure white color
195	neg	It has blue tone of color added to the white color and comes out in this weird color
195	neg	No patterns or anything
195	neg	There's no pattern to choose even if you set it to one color
196	pos	However, I do love what I have customized with the settings for my regular day-to-day uses
196	pos	I like that I can add weights to the mouse
196	pos	The mouse is very responsive when I click around
196	pos	I did discover with this mouse the delight of having a scroll wheel that you can change how it scrolls
196	pos	Overall, an excellent mouse worth the price point of $40
196	neg	Don't pay over that
196	pos	Also, the pleasure of making the DPI setting faster than what the computer's DPI setting is maxed out at is great
197	neg	This is a garbage product, especially since its marketed to the FPS market
197	neg	This mouse has been a waste of time, money, and energy
197	neg	This is a garbage product
197	neg	I bought this mouse on March 29 of 2019, and its already having a lot of problems
197	neg	Sensor and most of the buttons work fine, but the left mouse button is not working properly
197	neg	It will either register a click, double click, no click, or 'unclick' when holding the button down
197	neg	Its sorely disappointing after only having it for a year
197	neg	Lots of people on tech forums are exacting the same frustrations
197	neg	Its an endemic issue for this particular model
198	pos	This mouse has on-board memory, which let's you save your configuration into it
198	pos	This is nice, since I don't want to always run the Logitech software, and it's good for when you use this mouse on another computer and don't have the software there
198	pos	With this mouse, it's so easy to change DPI with the DPI buttons
198	pos	It's a plus that it has on-board memory
198	pos	The side buttons are very tactile and feel really solid
198	pos	Also, the left and right mouse click buttons have very low travel time and feel very responsive
198	pos	I highly recommend this mouse for anyone that has big hands
199	neg	The build quality felt cheap especially when it came to the rattling of the mouse wheel
199	neg	Well since I procrastinated i had to use the g502 for the month and at the end of that month the left click feature started to double left click aprox
199	neg	To sum it up, the mouse is ugly, cheap, looks like it was made for a child gamer to beg his parents to buy for them bc it looks futuristic and has a high DPI
199	neg	BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, the left click feature started failing after a little over 2 months of use
200	neg	Even if you adjust your sensitivity or add some of the weights the mouse comes with it is still really sensitive
200	neg	For the price, I would not buy it again
201	pos	The Logitech G502 in my opinion, is one of the best mice on the market you would ever get
201	pos	Every button on the mouse is programmable, but there are 5 extras that you can use for DPI or macros
201	pos	The ergonomics of the mouse are really good
201	pos	I can keep a really good grip on the mouse, and its textured rubber on the sides help with gripping
201	pos	I have quite large hands, and it still works flawlessly for me
201	pos	The mouse has on-board memory in case of no internet or if you need to play somewhere other than your house
201	pos	It only saves your RGB profiles and your sensitivity/DPI profiles
201	neg	This mouse cannot save macros onto the onboard memory
201	pos	The weight actually comes in advantage for me, as the weight of the mouse balances the speed at which I move it
201	neg	There is one issue that is common for the mouse, and that is the dreaded double-click issue that occurs with the G502
201	neg	The switches for the buttons may begin to register two presses
201	pos	Overall this mouse is a godsend, and is what made me use Logitech for all of my peripherals
202	pos	The Logitech Gaming Software is also amazing, no issues
202	neg	The only issue i have is a bit with the build quality its mostly plastic which is fine it has a decent feel for durability for a few months for me personally the side rubber grips get worn out so i end up buying a replacement
202	pos	But other than that i highly recommend it
203	neg	This product has a massive design flaw
203	neg	Logitech choose to go with cheap Chinese switches for this mouse and in a short period of time the switches are going to break
203	neg	This causes the LMB and RMB double-click for no reason, a lot of times while still holding the button down
204	pos	This is a great mouse
204	pos	I bought it for gaming, and it is ergonomic and the click of the mouse is just right, not too loud
204	pos	You can quickly interchange between DPI speed with a certain button, so it’s very convenient
204	pos	It has lots of buttons that make navigating your computer a breeze
204	pos	It also comes with some weights that you can put within the mouse to make it heavier or lighter based on what you like
204	pos	This mouse works for drag clicking and the scroll button can click sideways and downward, as well as two scrolling settings, you can make it scroll very fast and smoothly or have normal scrolling
204	pos	Definitely a great buy
205	pos	I was pleasantly surprised at how easily I was able to program keys to the mouse via their software which didn't take very long to download
205	pos	You could also close the program and open from your desktop in seconds
205	pos	I haven't had any mechanical issues
205	pos	All the buttons work well (no double clicking)
205	pos	I love the feature of the mouse wheel where if you push the button in below the wheel, it either opens fully or restricts slightly the motion of the wheel
205	pos	It's really cool
205	pos	I noticed that compared to any standard mouse I've ever used, my precision and accuracy of mouse movements has been greatly increased when using this mouse
205	pos	I haven't messed around with the weights, but you can add/remove weights to make the mouse heavier/lighter
205	pos	It's everything else about the mouse that I like
205	pos	Overall, It's a great mouse
206	neg	It's extremely frustrating to say the least
206	neg	Except the setting is from a much older version so can't do that either
206	neg	It's been 2 weeks and I already hate this thing
206	neg	Trying to do anything when your mouse flicks across the screen because you're trying to use it, is beyond annoying
207	pos	_-------_The moose was great while it worked, it pairs well with Logitech keyboards and the color is consistent because why not have LEDs everywhere
207	neg	But somewhere in the added complexity of including stuff like that reduces the shelf life
208	neg	Right mouse button started to fail after about a year
208	neg	I mostly use it for computer graphics work so it was incredibly frustrating when the mouse would basically unclick in the middle of a drag and drop or resizing of a window
208	neg	I was able to remap right click to another button, but for what I paid for it this is incredibly annoying
209	neg	First one was great till it had a double click issue, I assumed it was just me being unlucky and got a second one because it felt great
209	neg	And 1 year into it's life span it gets the double click issue again
209	neg	Updating drivers doesn't work
209	neg	Just poor quality in whatever they put into the clicker
209	neg	Clarification on the double click issue, pressing the right side for me will double click every time you press it
209	neg	Sometimes sticking so you cannot drag any windows anymore
210	neg	CONS:Mistakenly hitting the sniper button
210	pos	I would recommend this product
210	neg	UPDATE 4/30/19: Had it for a few months i think but now it's causing an issue
210	neg	Random double clicks when i try to hold down and drag something on my screen, noticed it when i was playing a game, caused my character to drop it on the ground instead of move it
210	neg	Seems this is a big issue going on with ANY G502 models
211	neg	First, the box was damaged a bit (As shown in picture) but that's okay, when I opened it up the mouse was dusty and dirty, it clearly had been used and refurbished (The box was sealed)
211	neg	There were smudges and scratches beneath the mouse
211	neg	The mouse looks sick and all, but it's actually not comfortable at all
211	neg	After using it for an hour, the feeling of discomfort is ON
211	neg	The scroll wheel is so stiff
211	neg	Overall I'm not happy with this mouse for its price, I have better choices for even cheaper prices
212	pos	The mouse feels great in the hand and all of the programable buttons are easy to reach
212	pos	It also has additional weights to get your desired amount of drag resistance
212	pos	The build quality seems pretty good
212	pos	The scroll wheel is solid, the cable is braided, and the buttons all have a good feel to them
212	pos	The Logitech software is very good for setting up macros, mapping buttons, changing RGB settings, etc
212	pos	Overall it seems like a great mouse for the price
213	pos	Plus, it's an excellent workout for your hand and arm movement
213	pos	And it's comfortable too when holding it
213	pos	The mouse response is good, plus the side buttons are an excellent feature
213	neg	Minor issues to keep in mind, it has a lot of open edges/corners that can collect dust and dead skin cells
213	pos	Steep price aside, I'd say it's a near-perfect mouse for your gaming and content creation needs
214	neg	I took a chance on this mouse and yep, the hardware broke in short order
214	neg	This mouse has just been on my desk with light use and already has issues
215	neg	It doesn't happen on every click, but as the mouse ages, it happens more and more until it is eventually unusable
216	neg	Unfortunately the Special Edition started having sustained click & drag problems, making it difficult drag & drop or highlight items after around a year of use
216	pos	Both of my standard G502s have worked perfectly for me
216	pos	The ergonomics are great, the button features are pleasant without being over riddled
218	pos	That will be well used in World of Warcraft and Grounded the Game
218	pos	This manufacturer has a very good rep especially with me
218	pos	Rubber with bumpy grips on left and right, helps hold the hand in place
218	pos	The cord is fabric lined so it doesn't have a "memory" of staying in a position it shouldn't
219	pos	This particular model has been one of my favorites and I use it on my main gaming desktop as well as my work laptop
219	pos	It has enough buttons to make it flexible without having so many as to make it overly complicated, especially for fingers that are not in the small glove category
220	pos	The mouse itself is great, from a hardware standpoint
220	pos	Fastest sensor, max of 25k dpi, reliable switches, what's not to like
220	pos	There are 2 buttons right next to the left mouse button, the most used button on a mouse, the 2 buttons adjust the dpi (sensitivity) of the mouse
220	neg	Because they are literally right next to the left mouse button, it is super easy to accidentally press on it
221	pos	First of all, this is a really comfortable mouse to use
221	neg	At that point - almost as if there was a timer in it, the left mouse button becomes intermittent
221	neg	You are at an extreme disadvantage when the trigger fails 50% of the time - until a few days later it is completely gone
221	pos	But it is so comfortable
222	neg	Holding the RMB down will intermittently register multiple clicks
223	pos	I absolutely love this mouse as a device
223	pos	The buttons are great, it feels good in the hand, it's very responsive
223	neg	What drives me insane is how awful the "GHub" software is
223	neg	It periodically updates and then randomly my mouse stops working until I spend 10-15 minutes fighting with the software to not default to a different profile or update firmware for a feature I don't need
224	pos	I love this mouse
224	pos	My girlfriend, who is a recent PC gamer convert, loves this mouse
224	pos	This mouse feels comfortable
224	pos	The customizable weights is a great idea
224	pos	The customizable buttons are also great, too
225	neg	Bought this a little over a year ago, started having issues with my left click button clicking multiple times with one click- very annoying and makes it impossible to use
225	neg	Basically, Logitech uses cheap & poorly designed switches that wear out easily
226	pos	Most of them have great response time, click well, and aren't mushy at all
226	pos	DPI can be adjusted on-the-fly or if you're like me, those buttons can be used for other purposes like macros, in-game actions, etc
226	pos	The good: 9 high-quality programmable buttons, and the scroll wheel
226	pos	The scroll wheel can be toggled from having a "bumpy" mode to free-spinning using a mechanical button (can't be programmed cause it functions mechanically)
226	pos	Weight can be changed
226	pos	DPI display (3 bars of light) allow easy checking of DPI
226	pos	Mouse can be tuned any way you want
226	neg	Scroll wheel tilt functions are a little more mushy, and it's hard to tell when they're activated
226	neg	The triangle patterns on both side of the mouse pick up dirt
226	pos	Pretty good mouse
227	neg	After a couple of months of use, this mouse wouldn't function properly, the pointer is jittery and won't hold among other things
227	neg	The 2nd mouse is doing the same malfunctions as the first
228	neg	You can have this problem with either the left or right buttons, or both
228	neg	But it got worse over time until it was clearly an issue with the mouse
228	neg	More often I get around 10 bad clicks out of 100
229	pos	I have slightly large hands, and even though this mouse has a slightly smaller footprint than the g602 it still fits my hand better
229	pos	I mean it REALLY feels great in my hand
229	pos	Well worth the $80
229	pos	I also love the logitech gaming software and the ability to adjust your DPI profile settings and such
231	pos	This mouse feels great
231	neg	The two buttons on the left side are a little too low
231	neg	My biggest complaint is the scroll wheel is free flowing
231	neg	It spins too easily and there's no click sensation
232	neg	It requires different software (G Hub) which also requires uninstalling LGS
233	neg	And this mouse failed me 5 days ago
233	neg	it will drop the signal suddenly
233	neg	Failed within half year is a totally new experience for me
233	pos	Beside this problem, it is a comfortable mouse
233	neg	However, it failed to deliver the basic mouse function
234	neg	The left click on this startes getting flaky about 6months after purchase
234	neg	It would randomly drop the click, so click-and-holds were frustrating
234	neg	A full force press causes the drop, while a minimal force seems to work fine
236	pos	Pros:- Easy to map new bindings to each button with the software available
236	pos	- Good solid feel to the mouse overall and about the same size as the razer 2013 deathadder (meaning it's decent for larger hands)
236	pos	- There are included weoghts allowing for adjustment based on personal preference
236	pos	I find certain mice to be too light, so the option for additional weight is personally greatly appreciated
236	neg	Cons:- You are required to download the software for this mouse manually and it isn't the easiest interface I have ever used
236	neg	Without previous software experience (mine being from razer synapse), it might be a challenge for inexperienced users
236	pos	All in all:This mouse is a great choice for the most seasoned veterans of gaming and the new-comers alike
237	pos	This mouse is faster and more responsive than my previous one, which was the Gamdias Ourea mouse
237	neg	Sometimes the mouse would stop being recognized in my windows 10 pro 64bit 20H2 system
237	pos	Software and drivers work perfectly and the support is excellent
237	pos	Highly recommend this mouse for all your gaming needs
238	pos	The software is intiutive and doesn't feel bloated
238	pos	Has everything you need to control RGB, DPI and other settings
238	pos	I love the option of customizeable weights
238	pos	Highly recommend for this price range
239	pos	This is a great mouse
239	pos	Very responsive and comfortable
239	neg	But expect to have to buy a new one every year because the switches for the left and right click wear out and start double clicking shortly after a year of normal use
239	neg	Issue is, you can only click a certain number of times before it's deemed defective or not
239	neg	Mine was having an issue, but not reliably enough to be caught by their check so I wasn't able to exchange the mouse
240	neg	I am extremely disappointed with this mouse
240	neg	Earlier this month, I started to notice that the right mouse button wasn't detecting when I clicked
240	neg	Now even that doesn't work
240	neg	The only thing that seems to reliably get it to detect the click is pressing down VERY hard whenever I right click
240	neg	In addition, starting yesterday I ran into the same issue others have described where it double-right clicks with only a single click of the button
240	neg	It's getting to the point where a number of games are becoming almost unplayable, so I have to replace the thing
240	neg	Words cannot begin to express my disappointment
240	neg	It is possible that what I've experienced is a freak incident
240	neg	I do not intend to buy this mouse ever again
241	pos	No double clicking, very "hefty" feeling (not heavy as in "I can't move the mouse quickly", but heavy as in "that feels sturdy and of good quality"), feels great to hold in my hand
241	pos	You can also add or remove weights from the mouse to control how light you want it to be, which I think is really cool
241	pos	I haven't programmed many of the buttons yet (I guess I'm lazy), but it does have the option for those shortcuts to be customized
241	pos	If you're hesitant, I would definitely recommend this mouse
242	neg	He is on his second mouse and told me that it is the worst mouse to buy since left click has a defect
242	neg	I am on my third mouse and confirmed with him that my third mouse has a defect on left click as well
242	neg	DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES OR ANY PC EDITING
242	neg	This mouse will double click with a single click or when clicking and holding/dragging items it will not register or let the item go
243	pos	First off, this is a great mouse when it works properly
243	neg	Unfortunately when I lift off the pad to reposition during gaming it sometimes loses tracking for a moment and launches my view all over the place until it reestablishes tracking
243	neg	I've searched for solutions and it seems to be an somewhat common issue with the Hero sensor
243	pos	As for ergonomics, I would love to meet the person who decided to put the 2 dpi selector switches right next to the left click button
243	neg	I wouldn't buy it, the new hero sensors dont live up to the hype and were going backwards in ergonomics
244	neg	The right click on this mouse stopped functioning properly within 8 months
244	neg	After two weeks of back and forth, providing a video of the problem, providing a picture with my ticket and serial, I get a message saying it's out of stock and to wait another 3 weeks
245	pos	This one is even better with the ability to change the color and the new cable
245	pos	My favorite is between this and the original r
245	pos	With the thinner, lighter cable on the hero and the ability to change the lighting, it's near perfect for me
246	neg	However, I am frustrated that after a little over a year, this mouse developed the same left click issues my last one (Logitech Wired Pro which also lasted a little over a year) did
246	neg	Whenever I perform a single left click, it often clicks twice and when I hold the left mouse button to drag (like you do all the time in a strategy game or moving files around) it will regularly disengage as if I lifted my finger, even though I am not changing pressure
246	neg	Nearly every time I single clicked a space in this text box, while writing this review, I selected the word next to the space like I double clicked or the entire paragraph like I triple clicked
247	neg	It has an infamous problem where it gets stuck in an infinite loading screen after a fresh install or update
248	pos	The mouse is heavy and feels very premium
248	pos	It works just fine without any programs or special drivers, but I recommend the GHUB program since you can customize the sensitivity more precisely
248	neg	This normally wasn't an issue, but during games where you hold right click to aim, it made them unplayable
249	neg	Right-click does not hold consistently, frequently unpressing/pressing the button while you hold it down
249	neg	It gets a lot worse if you right-click and drag
249	neg	Unacceptable for any game that relies on this
249	neg	Both left and right click buttons will frequently double-click when you single-click
249	neg	Awful for moments where double-click confirms, or when you mean to click+drag and it double-clicks instead
249	pos	Pointer precision and response is good, it's ergonomic, wheel works (for me but I've read others having issues with it) - everything else with the mouse is fine
249	neg	But this is absolutely awful for gaming anything that requires left/right-click precision and consistency
251	pos	Everything is working great
251	pos	GREAT MOUSE
251	pos	This mouse feels great in my hand and the weights are a great option to fit this thing just right
251	neg	****They recently moved away from LGS to some ghub TERRIBLE software
251	neg	Incredibly unintuitive and clunky to use
251	neg	They will map on the software but they will not register on any application, not even a word document
252	pos	This mouse is comfortable and precise
252	pos	The G glows too, and you can change the color
252	neg	My only complaint is the positioning of navigation buttons
252	neg	Sometimes I bump the dpi setting buttons against the side of my keyboard if I run out of room, but that's on me for not allowing enough space
252	pos	Aside from that, it's everything I want in a mouse
252	pos	My favorite feature is the mouse wheel is unlockable
252	pos	You've got your normal clicky mouse wheel scrolling, but you can unlock it to make the wheel free-spinning
252	pos	This is extremely useful in any game with a semi-auto weapon and a high fire rate (faster than you can normally click)
254	pos	The G502 feels great in my hand
254	pos	The software isn't anything special, but it works fine
254	pos	I've bought Logitech mice for about 2 decades now and they've always done well for me until now
254	neg	This mouse has a design flaw
254	neg	The first mouse survived 6 months
254	neg	The second survived 4
254	neg	For me the failure mode has been if I hold down the left mouse button, it can randomly register multiple clicks while the button is held down
254	neg	It's a shame
255	neg	Sounds and looks cheap
255	neg	Mouse tracks well but tends to reset its settings on reboot
255	pos	Mouse wheel is highest quality part
255	neg	They get dirty and kink and frey
256	pos	software works great with it, and it feels a lot more responsive in games than other mice
256	pos	its also cool to have people look at it and get confused by the alien shape
256	pos	free scroll wheel is extremely satisfying and i find myself unlocking it every so often to play with it like a fidget spinner
256	pos	definitely a 5/5
256	neg	the only downside i had with this mouse is that the top left 2 keys are a bit harder to reach as well as the one on the top, but i usually use them for the likes of music\volume controlls becasue the other 3 are more than enough
257	pos	It glides easier and is more responsive than my old mouse, which should be a good thing
258	pos	I've been lucky so far with the mouse scroll wheel still working
258	pos	The extra mouse buttons helps with secondary roles like switching optics and fire select modes
258	pos	Very comfortable mouse to use and the Logitech app is very easy to use and navigate
258	pos	Mouse clicks are light and with a positive tactile click
259	neg	my logitech mouse left mouse pointer button slowly stopped registering input
259	neg	at first it was here and there then got worse and worse eventually i had to buy a new mouse
259	neg	Now i own the logitech hero 502 and after a little over a year it has begun doing the same thing
260	pos	Mouse has a great build quality, works well, feels good in the hand and is very responsive
260	pos	The software is easy to use and navigate
260	neg	I really like the mouse but days after I purchased it, the right mouse button was intermittent and not consistent(I'm not hard on my hardware and treat it with care)
261	pos	This is just a great mouse for gaming and productivity
261	pos	You can save different profiles to the mouse and switch between them depending on what you are doing
261	pos	The hyperscroll wheel is a beast at helping get through long PDFs and Excel files at work
261	pos	Also being able to switch sensitivity on the fly comes in handy too
262	pos	Nice mouse all in all
262	pos	More buttons than I've found uses for yet, highly programmable
262	pos	Better fit than most mice for large hands, but a perfectly sized mouse would still be a bit longer
262	neg	Down side, when I add the included weights to it, the magnetic panel on the bottom can't close
262	neg	I'm really disappointed in Logitech with this mouse
263	pos	I love this mouse
263	pos	This mouse is really nice
263	pos	Feels great and works well
264	pos	Still works amazingly after now many many years
264	neg	Now with the newwer G502 Hero, they have made the G502 essentially flawless
264	neg	The new mouse is basically flawless
264	pos	No issues with the sensor, rgb, or anything
264	pos	I'd be surprised if anyone is on the edge with this mouse, it's entirely worth buying
265	neg	Sometimes when I scroll down, stop the wheel and start moving the mouse around it would scroll up or down on it's own
266	neg	Also had my key binds not work at all
266	pos	Pretty small mouse and quite heavy for the size
266	neg	The button layout on the side is kind of bad, you will have to reach for the bigger button because the forward and back buttons are set back
266	neg	Sometimes the scroll wheel lags, currently have it set to switch weapons and sometimes doesn't switch right away
267	pos	The click this mouse produces is so much better than other mice I've owned
267	pos	- Adjustable weight- This mouse is heavier than some of my other mice but somehow the weight is distributed better
267	neg	Cons:- The weight, yes, I know I stated it's weight is distributed very well
267	pos	I highly recommend this mouse and to be honest any other mouse made by Logitech they're really good quality products and they're built to last
268	neg	This mouse was great, until it started having a left click problem
268	neg	It was registering plenty of extra clicks
268	neg	I again expressed my dissatisfaction and that I need to use the mouse until the new one arrives
269	pos	I've got pretty big hands and this mouse feels great to me
269	pos	All the buttons are easy to reach without feeling like I have to stretch or pull my hand back
269	pos	The ghub software is easy enough to work with
269	pos	Overall, nothing but positive feedback from me
269	pos	I don't think you'll find a better mouse at this price point
270	pos	Got it for the amount of buttons and was surprised by the level of customization
271	neg	The only issues that make these unreliable, is there is a defect that causes the left click to double click
272	pos	I had many mice before this one, but I have to say that this one has won the gold medal so far
272	pos	The quality feels nice, the clickiness is responsive, the setup is economical, and the bottoms are efficient
273	pos	I love this little guy
273	pos	I love the ability to switch to different dpi on the spot or its ability to work on almost all surfaces — including bed sheets with lines on them or glass surfaces
273	neg	Also, the profiles can have a hard time sticking and being saved
273	neg	This can be a bit frustrating with having to adjust your options every so often
273	pos	I love the response and action on the buttons
273	pos	I especially love the ergonomic positioning of the additional buttons and the ability to program all the buttons to macros or keyboard strokes
274	pos	I love my Logitech mice and this one performs very well too
274	pos	The software is simple and it tracks great on my mouse pad
274	neg	My main problem with this mouse is that it is too small for most grown men or adults who would wear size large gloves
274	neg	This negates any ergonomic benefits because you have to grip it incorrectly
275	pos	The mouse itself has good build quality, crisp clicks and a good amount of programmable buttons
275	neg	Another major issue for me is the weight, it is way heavy for an FPS mouse
275	pos	Finally, the ergonomics is very counter intuitive
276	neg	I have to press down pretty hard to keep it from slipping
276	neg	It is just too slippery
276	neg	This is especially problematic when gaming
277	pos	I like the adjustable weights
277	pos	I was much happier with the size when I found a good weight for me
277	neg	The software, G-Hub is hot garbage
277	neg	I had trouble getting some key combinations working as expected
277	neg	That's disappointing
278	pos	Overall this is a great mouse
278	pos	Very happy
279	pos	I loved the feel of the mouse
279	pos	It fit my hand well
279	pos	I liked being able to adjust the weight of the mouse
279	pos	The software was alright
279	pos	My previous Logitech mice lasted years of heavy gaming for hours each day before experiencing the same issues
279	neg	Disappointed at the quality
280	pos	A decent mouse for the money, lots of buttons
280	pos	For normal computer use, it's outstanding
280	neg	My one complaint with it applies to every single gaming mouse I've ever used:  the mouse wheel doesn't have enough resistance, so when you use it as a button while gaming, it tends to roll forward or backward too, which has unintended consequences in 99% of games
281	pos	It just feels good
281	pos	Just nothing but quality
282	pos	Totally worth the 80$
284	neg	There's no way any of these mice would have passed that test unless shortcuts were taken
284	neg	Like many have posted here, after a while the mouse starts clicking 10 times for every 1 click you do
284	neg	It starts to effect both left and right clicking
284	neg	I can't even drag files on my comp anymore because it drops them or opens them up because it's registering me clicking 80 times
285	pos	The big benefit to me is the adjustable weights
285	pos	Overall, this mouse is incredible and there is nothing so far I can report to dislike about it
285	pos	Highly recommended
286	pos	It's a Logitech mouse, so it seems to be sturdy and functions well so far
286	pos	Otherwise, it's a great mouse
286	pos	Definetely still worth the money
288	pos	This member of the 502 family, the Logitech G502 HERO, takes a great mouse (G502 Proteus Spectrum RGB Tunable) with a great heritage (G502 Proteus Core) and makes it even greater
289	pos	This thing is pretty darn good
289	pos	Very responsive without being touchy
289	pos	Able to set the G keys to be any key I want them to be
289	pos	Easy to do macros for gaming
290	neg	After several months of use, left mouse button starts to register multiple click even though only one click pressed
290	neg	This can be very frustrating when you need do an drag function, like dragging files to different folder or highlighted text
291	neg	The only downside is that the software is required if you want any of the features
292	pos	This mouse is amazing, until it isn't
292	neg	With both of the mouses, the left and right click would release randomly while I would have the button pressed down
292	neg	Making it impossible to aim in FPS titles
292	neg	At first I thought it was just a bad mouse the first time, but when I got a second one the same exact thing happened
292	neg	Something is wrong with the build quality or the parts they use inside of this mouse
292	neg	It worked great for a couple of months, and then the problems started
293	pos	The mouse itself seems fine
293	pos	It's reasonably comfortable and adjustable weight
293	neg	The problem is the Logitech G Hub is absolute garbage software
293	neg	Issues I've had include losing profiles, not switching profiles, hanging on firmware updates, graphical problems in the software, crashes, and just a general terrible UI and UX design
294	neg	This thing will let you down with double click issues within the first or second month of use, so you better look something else, save your money
295	neg	Cons:-The mouse wheel is ridiculous, it spins like crazy, I struggle to model 3d or animate anything with this mouse, like just a touch and your camera/scroll is all the way up or down, so I'm at odds
296	pos	Compare against several Razer mice and other Logitech mice, this is my favorite for gaming
296	pos	Ergonomics are perfect(assuming you don't need it to be ambidextrous)
296	pos	Three thumb keys and two extra index finger keys are perfect for assigning vital actions in a game
296	pos	Adjustable sensitivity
296	pos	Smooth or lock to click scroll wheel is a must have in every mouse
297	pos	To put it simply, this mouse seems perfectly fine in terms of form and function
297	neg	The only issue is that the design of the mouse makes it some what annoying to clean
297	neg	Dirt and grime and accumulate within the textured triangles and can be very annoying to clean unless you are wiping it down daily
298	pos	But this mouse is absolutely perfect for me
298	pos	The thumb wrest on the side is perfect
298	pos	The thumb buttons are also in a really good place, I never find myself accidently hitting any or finding I can't reach one, with the exception of the button furthest forward, but I never use that anyway
299	pos	Seems like a nice mouse
299	neg	Has software/hardware issues
299	neg	This makes me not be able to control my DPI
299	neg	Super annoying
300	pos	the mouse is just so precise - aiming in video games is much steadier, and it helps me so much with productivity because i can move the mouse so quickly and not overshoot whatever I'm trying to click
300	pos	it's also ergonomically so comfortable - my hands are quite large (can easily reach 10ths on a piano if that means anything to you), so a lot of mice feel a bit small to me
300	pos	This mouse's shape somehow fits my hand comfortably, and the rubber sides make for a very nice grip
300	pos	there's some extra things that aren't crucial to me but are nice, such as the RGB, adjustable weights, and scroll wheel free/notched toggle, but they're certainly appreciated
301	pos	This mice is just so comfortable to hold in my hand
301	pos	The grip on the mice is perfect for me, I can move this thing on my entire pad without a break, smoothly
301	pos	Another thing never appealed to me was the weights
301	pos	I popped them all in, and played around with the mouse for an hour or two, and honestly, I like it more than I thought I would
302	pos	Customizable color RGB through the G Hub app as well
302	pos	Gaming feels like a breeze with everything more precise, the buttons more responsive, and a clear rise in quality from my last model
302	pos	I recommend this mouse to anyone who prefers a wired model and is looking for something to game with
304	neg	Big cons IMO, the scroll wheel is absolute garbage
304	neg	Buttons do not feel solid in any way
305	pos	This is probably the best mouse I ever used
305	neg	The other mouse was very light weighted and felt cheap
305	pos	This is built like a brick and works amazingly
305	pos	It gives a nice speed to the mouse
305	pos	Lastly the mouse is fully custom with lighting with full rgb
305	pos	So far this has been really great
306	neg	The dpi buttons are in a bad places as I was always hitting one with my left figure and the adjustment of dpi was bad
306	neg	The design of the mouse is not great as it is rounded on the right side so I was always lifting the mouse when moving right and losing movement on screen
307	neg	This will manifest in either the mouse double clicking with a single press, or not being able to maintain a held press without registering additional clicks
308	pos	Positives: Comfortable to hold, weighty, nice to the touch, cool lights, lots of features
309	neg	after that, it started acting up with some random double-clicking and click+hold interruption
310	neg	Second mouse had two issues, the right click button sometimes double clicks so if I am scoping in playing any FPS game, it will scope out or jitter
310	neg	Super annoying
310	neg	Like a tiny piece of the plastic sticks outwards and scratches the mouse pad
310	neg	Anyway the ergonomics are actually trash
310	neg	Some of the "extra" buttons are too easy to accidentally press
310	neg	Boom accidentally touched like 4 buttons
310	neg	The 2 extra buttons on the left mouse button are just too out of reach of the index finger
311	neg	I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase
311	neg	The mouse will randomly disconnect while I am in the middle of using it
311	neg	The mouse will disconnect for about a second from my computer and reconnect again right after, but in the middle of gaming that is not acceptable
312	pos	I’ve been looking for a nice gaming mouse, and if you are too, you can click Add to Cart
312	pos	The Logitech G502 Hero works absolute wonders
312	pos	For starters, the weight customization is amazing
312	pos	You can change how heavy the mouse is to fit your own needs, and it comes with plenty of extra weights
312	pos	It has a nice clicking sound and it’s easy to click fast on it
312	pos	It also has a very nice scroll wheel, and overall it feels very sturdy and well-made
312	pos	Logitech GHub is a simple install for this, and it is very user friendly
312	pos	I have had no issues with it thus far, and it is likely my favourite accessory to my computer
313	neg	Just under a year old and the double click/click and drag fail has begun
313	neg	The problem is clicking, holding and dragging
313	neg	The click releases and then clicks again while dragging
313	neg	I have updated and still not working properly
314	pos	The weights are a cool concept (although I ended up only using one, usually I like light mice)
314	neg	The main con: The unlockable scroll wheel sort of moves a bit/creates a rattle if you move the mouse quickly, whether locked or unlocked
315	pos	build quality is good and egos are great
315	neg	It's impossible to play games or even drag a window from one monitor to another
316	pos	I want to start by saying I love love love this mouse
316	pos	Feels nice in my hand, love the weight adjustability option
316	pos	For just every day use and playing my favorite games, this worked wonderful
316	neg	Unfortunately, I have now experienced the constant click/double click issue
316	neg	This creates a lot of issues with my gaming so I will be purchasing a different mouse to replace this one :(
317	pos	Third, this mouse is incredibly budget friendly, especially when it's on sale
317	pos	To be honest, I don't actually know how Razer and Corsair compete with this thing on the market
317	pos	You will not be disappointed
318	pos	The mouse overall was decent while it lasted
318	neg	However the software for the mouse is pretty poop
318	neg	There were numerous bugs with the software, manually starting the Logitech app every time I boot up was pretty annoying after awhile
318	neg	The same day the left click broke the rgb decided to go out
318	neg	When I plugged it into a different port the port then shorted and broke the usb3 ports on the front of my computer
319	neg	I tried to just straighten the cord, but it kept deforming and causing high friction against the mouse pad
319	pos	So yay, I finally have a nice mouse
321	neg	Shame on Logitech for using this faulty design
322	neg	The mouse wheel was either to tight or if I used the free wheel it was to loose
322	neg	After fiddling with it I finally just threw it in the trash and replaced it with a $20 mouse
323	neg	Not more than 4 months after I got it I started noticing the right click would "double click" when clicked once or it wouldn't hold a click either
323	neg	Now 9 months later and the left click is going out too, whenever I click on the top of a window it double clicks for me maximizing the window
324	pos	I didn't think the provided weights would be enough but they actually work well
324	pos	I work 10+ hours a day with a lot of mouse use and this is a great mouse
325	neg	For about a month and a half now, the left mouse button doesn't click properly, sometimes it doesn't single click, often it doesn't hold a click (i
326	neg	Unfortunately, the left mouse button started double clicking when I was single clicking or attempting to click and drag
326	neg	Within 2 months the new mouse had the same issue
327	neg	This issue is called double-clicking and is well documented with this mouse
329	pos	The mouse is otherwise functional, nice shape and feel
330	neg	the ergonomics are not great, it is very flat and long compared to other ergo mice i have
330	pos	The only positive is the easy to program buttons
331	pos	I love the ability to add or remove the extra weights as needed
331	pos	The Logitech G hub software is easy to find and download, this is the app that allows to easily change advanced settings like LED color/brightness, and most importantly to customize the programmable buttons
332	pos	The mouse itself is fine
333	neg	First off, it was really easy to hit the wheel left or right while scrolling, which could make my browser switch tabs
333	neg	It was also difficult to click the wheel without it registering as a lateral movement
333	neg	The odd curves were really uncomfortable and caused some pretty intense cramps in my hand after little use
334	neg	The app's interface is also awful
336	neg	In addition, a single & long click is considered as double-click for some reason
337	neg	I cant click a tab and drag it
338	pos	DPI setting flexibility is great
338	pos	Tracks very smoothly and I like the weights
338	pos	A heavier mouse feels better for some reason
339	neg	Mouse is randomly double clicking both left and right
340	pos	Initially this is a really great mouse
340	pos	It has very smooth control, finely tunable speeds, easy to access buttons, easy to understand lighting controls and DPI schemes
340	neg	The click and hold fails often now
341	pos	The scroll wheel lock is an awesome feature, and while the locked-wheel is a bit more clunky than I'd like, the unlocked wheel rolls around with ease
341	pos	Such a nice feature
343	pos	The build quality of the G502 is nice
343	neg	The G502 is unfortunately not compatible with the older Logitech Gaming Software
344	neg	Unfortunately, yesterday it started having an issue where it registers a single click or a click and drag as a double click
344	neg	I use this mouse for CAD, graphic design, and gaming so this issue is quite debilitating

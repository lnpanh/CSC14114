The button location are solid enough for me to be satisfied the only issue I have with this mouse is that the scroll wheel now spins freely and is one hell of a headache playing most fps games as the wheel usually switches weapons in most games.So for example you run out of ammo in game and want to switch to your secondary.. well you'll switch to it but switch right back about 3 times. Kind of a deal breaker for clutch moment gaming.***edit***Turns out i'm an idiot.

The first one I had for a very short time. During that time I was doing a lot of gaming/designing and the click issue showed up very quickly. Amazon was great and provided an exchange. During the time I had the new one, I was not doing as much gaming/designing so the click issue took longer to show up. I am convinced this is a design flaw in the mouse itself. I will not purchase another one of these. The price is not worth it at all with the click issue.  To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or double clicks. I have tested this extensively. If it wasn't for that issue, this mouse would be wonderful. However, this creates a lot of issues with gaming, graphic design and so much more when trying to work and renders the mouse almost useless because of productivity.\n\n"], "2": ["neg", "\n\n  It seems logitech has either a quality control problem or a supply problem because the switches in these mice are absolute garbage. The mouse is honestly one of the best mice I have ever used while it worked - until it didn't. Less than a year old and $75 gets you a mouse that feels great in the hand until the scroll wheel starts jumping around and the left click starts randomly double clicking, and then not clicking at all - all intermittently. There are numerous reviews out there one can find by simply googling \"g502 double click\" in which people either return them and hope their next one doesn't do the same, refund them, or the more technical self swap of a mechanical switch for the left click.I will not be going any of these routes and I'm sad to say it because Logitech used to be a staple in PC peripherals. Now it's not the plastic it's made of.edit: As I write this update, I have actually taken another star off for the true, 1 star review. I typically don't believe in one star reviews because it's generally an overreaction and everything is either 5 stars great or 1 star horrible, but Logitech has sunken to the 1 star territory. After literally 15 emails back and forth with Logitech support, I had to use their website to prove I was having a double click issue, which was easily done, but had to film both myself, the mouse, and the serial number from the mouse in the video while doing it. I could easily reproduce the double click fault in both the left AND right click function and sent proof. I sent my mouse back to Logitech on approx the 10th of January 2020. They received my mouse the 15th of January 2020. I don't hear anything for 8 days until I first contact them again asking for an update. Still nothing. Finally I receive an email stating that my product is not faulty, and therefore doesn't qualify for the warranty. Nevermind the evidence I had to first email them. Nevermind the 100% reproduce able error in both left and right clicking.I will never buy a logitech product again.Do yourself a favor and google 'logitech double click' and question whether you want to buy this mouse, likely have the issue, and then not have the warranty honored. I bought a cheap mouse replacement to tide me over and it works much better anyway.\n\n"], "3": ["pos", "\n\n  Let me start by saying that I've used a lot of gaming mice, like, over 50 of them. The Logitech g502 was always a quality mouse and tons of people love the thing just based on the design and overall quality of the mouse; That being said, there are a few things to consider if you're thinking about getting this one in particular.The Pros of this mouse are fairly straightforward, and are as follows:- Comfortable shape for most right handed people, but should be more comfortable for people with medium to large size hands.- Good build quality which easily places it in the same category as other 'premium' around this price point or even a bit higher.-  Scroll wheel: this is one of my personal favorite features of the mouse. Allows infinite scroll to get through annoying EULA pages quicker and also quickly raise or lower volume on YouTube or other video streaming sites, but without sacrificing the much needed precision of the standard mouse wheel steps. Feels satisfying to use, but it is made of metal, which leads to a negative I'll be mentioning later on.- Sensor: The Logitech Hero sensor has been tested numerous times and found to be roughly on par with the PMW3360 series sensors (including the 3366 on the original g502) while being advantageous for usage in wireless mice due to the lessened draw of power which allows for a longer battery life.The Cons of this mouse make it hard to recommend to everyone, and are why I don't usually recommend it as a first choice.-Weight: My god. This thing is one of the heaviest mice I've used for an extended period of time. I don't know exactly how much this weighs, but it feels pretty similar to the original, which I believe weighed in a little over 130 grams. Most gaming mice target a weight of 100g or LIGHTER, since lowering the weight of the mouse will make extended use easier and will allow for a greater degree of control.- Not a truly \"safe\" shape, this may or may not matter to you, but I felt that it's worth mentioning. Obviously this is a mouse for right handed people, and it may not necessarily be a great fit for you if your hands are very small (I have very small hands and cannot reach the sniper button at all, but the mouse is still comfortable).I would say it's a top tier mouse, but only if you can look past the weight. I would recommend that, as always, if you have the ability to do so, you should go to a local store and try some of the mice out to see which feels best to you, and make your decision after you have an idea what type of mouse shape you want.I won't recommend that you do or don't buy a product, so I'll leave it at that.\n\n"], "4": ["pos", "\n\n  Scroll wheel broke within the first week and now it freewheels like fidget spinner.

I have stopped using Logitech mice since they discontinued G9. I have been using Roccat Kone XTD since then that died after serving me for over 5 years. After reading reviews about G502 I decided to give it a try as I really liked the overall design and feel , it reminded me of G9.So when I learned they are refreshing the 502 with a new sensor I was skeptical to pay $30 more for the new one. Now that I used it I am glad I did. The refreshed model has a really thick and flexible cord that was apparently a major weakness in the original 502. Couple that with a really awesome sensor that is super accurate and sensitive to slightest movements and tracks on any surface (seriously I tried everything from a white paper to the palm of my hand) and you have a potential winner. However, the best part of this mouse is not that or the the materials that they used which also feels really nice and durable.While subjective and relevant to how big or small your hands are for me the way the mouse sits in my hand and how easy it is to access the buttons are the best indicators . The buttons themselves feel very satisfying to press thanks to the spring loaded mechanism. Last but not least is the scroll wheel. This... this scrollwheel I can probably write a whole paragraph on how good it is... Not only does it have the infinite mode that rolls beautifully but also its made from METAL. Its a nice chunk of metal that is just better than a plastic one in every way. I dont think I can go back to plastic mouse-wheels after using my G502. You might never use the 16000DPI sensor but if you used G502 and similar mice in the past and are due for an upgrade the refresh 502 is totally worth the money Logitech is asking for.\n\n"], "7": ["neg", "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0ORDERED = 05/11/2019 || SELLER = Amazon.com LLC || PAID = $59.35((FAILED ON 09/18/2020)):: PROS ::1.) Improved braided cable over previous G502 model.2.) The weight options are exact same as previous model. (Feels identical in all ways, easy to get used to.)3.) I'm about 6'-6\" and little over 200 lbs - fits my hand fairly well. (They don't make many BIG HAND mice :)4.) DPI shift button is epic for sniping btw!!! (Great for nudging objects in Adobe too.)5.) LIGHTSYNC added to this model is cool for custom rigs & lighting. (Single click, easy to enable.)6.) Fully customizable RGB LED, you can set color, cycle speed & mode indicators.7.) VERY VERY accurate mouse, 4,000 DPI higher than previous 12,000 DPI 502 model.  16,000 DPI is insane resolution tbh.8.) Rubberized areas can handle greasy, salty gamer hands lol (see pics.)....they are the most durable grips I have ever seen in my 30 years of using mice.:: CONS ::((FAILED)) LEFT MOUSE BUTTON FAILURE - The older version I have is more reliable after 3 years.  Logitech products across the board are having durability issues.  Their OLDER 2015 - 2018 Products were far superior.  Not sure what is going on with their design and quality control, but after MANY years and thousands of dollars of products there is a noticeable DROP in QUALITY & more specifically DURABILITY.  ((Possibly they are too trick for their own good)1.) The cord is much better, but this mouse still has one. (It's hard to find CONS with the G502 HERO.)2.) Really miss the cordless days, but this mouse catches every signal & the slightest movements.3.) The RGB is usually not prominent as it's under your hand or in sleep mode.4.) Free wheel mouse mode can be sensitive to twitch gaming.  Some rolling can occur, but you gotta be really shaking it.:: OVERALL :: I HATE CORDS, but I love this mouse so I am always torn between both worlds. I need to be highly accurate in my video, photography & gaming life, all the G502 series mice have enhanced my computer work & play!I have purchased 3 of them now, 2 of which have HEAVY use & abuse....they still work perfectly and remain accurate. Seriously this mouse brought my K/D up to new highs, it's so much better than the $100 cordless laser I'm still kind of in shock. It's a gaming AND business must have. Using this for websites, photo editing & detail alignments in Adobe is a dream come true.DON'T FORGET IT's EVEN GOT MACROS!?!? I don't use them to their full potential, but the few macros I have are awesome!FINAL NOTE: My first G502 is still rock solid even after years of abuse, nothing has failed.  Mouse wheel is 100% & so is the weight latch.I hated Logitech until I used the 502's, their mousewheels fail, wireless signal loss is constant (with exception to the $100 wireless lasers.) AND the rubberized grips always turned to 'sticky goo' after 3-4 years.  I was pissed off at Logitech when I bought the 502 & was ready to rip apart this mouse in a review if it SUCKED.\n\n"], "8": ["neg", "\n\n  I bought this mouse to replace the Logitech Performance MX, I had 4 of those in the past two years and they are great until they get the infamous double click issue. I did not want to spend another $99 on that and hopped this mouse would work better.The good:- It is a nice looking mouse from outsideThe bad:- Right out of the box, this mouse started randomly double clicking or needed to click multiple times for it to react.- On free-wheel mode, it just scrolls with the movement of the mouse, even if the wheel is not moving at all.- Not at all ergonomic, it will hurt your hand after 10 minutes using it. The back is too narrow, no support for the right side of your hand, and to hold it properly you have to close your hand in an awkward way.- Both options of the software to program/change settings are unnecessarily intrusive on your computer, and every 30 minutes or so, make it go sluggish with the mouse barely responding. If you remove the software the default settings for the buttons are useless.I have been a loyal Logitech buyer for over 20 years, but the quality of their products has been on a free fall for a while now, and this is the last product I buy from them. The quality of the product no longer justifies the price.So long Logitech, we had a good run!\n\n"], "9": ["neg", "\n\n  I really wanted to love this mouse. This style of form factor, with a nice little ledge for your thumb to rest on, doesn't get enough love from mouse OEMs. I also am a contrarian in still liking heavier mice, despite the recent trend in favor of ultra-light mice, and this thing feels nice and solid with the weights added. Finally, I really liked that the mouse is WIRED. Having run the gamut of wireless mice, I have found no matter what the claims are, they always are prone to connection glitches and, even when they work well for a time, are a PITA to always remember to keep charged. The new hero sensor is also awesome.Because of these desirable properties I lived in a state of denial about the mouse's many glaring flaws for months.Sadly, I am out of denial and into grief.The main issue with this mouse is the scroll wheel. It just sucks. The mouse semi-regularly just decides the scroll wheel is being clicked, resulting in lots of odd behavior. And then it's hard to know when you've successfully clicked the scroll wheel down, because it requires so much actuation force and yet has so little travel.The free-wheeling mode of the scroll wheel is reasonably nice, with a satisfying long spin, but it's almost impossible not to occasionally click the button that puts it back into incremental scrolling mode. This is a big deal, because the incremental scrolling mode is unbelievably ghastly and thus something you would never use voluntarily The tactility feels all wrong--both too abrupt/tactile and not sticky enough for something that is so abrupt/tactile. At the same time, the scroll wheel actually rattles because of the force of the increments--but only like maybe half the time. The combination of these features induces an overall sensation of unpredictability and randomness along with an unpleasant sound.A less critical but still painful flaw is the button placement.  The idea of a little ledge sticking out is to use a palm grip and rest your thumb there, right? One would think so. However, doing so places one of the other two main side buttons totally out of reach. You have bend your thumb back so hard to reach back button that it basically means only a claw grip is truly comfortable--in which case the thumb ledge goes unused.So, all in all, yeah I think Logitech should go back to the drawing board and generate this style of mouse with different button placement and a much more nicely tuned scroll wheel.\n\n"], "10": ["neg", "\n\n  Purchased this mouse on July 2nd and as of the day of this review the mouse went from being a 5 to a 1. I really expected so much more out of Logitech and incredibly upset that in less then a month the mouse is already giving me issues. I purchased this mouse to replace my old razer deathadder which lasted me for approximately 3 years. I figured since I already owned the G402 that it would make sense to upgrade to a G502 and give it a shot with the weights feature. The weights were pretty nice and helped in a way, but what makes me give this mouse a 1 rating is the right click problem that so many people complained about. So when I play Overwatch I play A LOT of widow and recently the right click would always double click as I'm sitting there scoped in. It happened so frequently that I can't even play the game properly. So if you're looking for a game that you need to scope STAY AWAY. The double clicking is truly a problem and I decided to risk purchasing this mouse even after seeing so many complain about it in the reviews. So again, if you need to hold your clicks, keep searching for another mouse.  Shame on you Logitech :(\n\n"], "11": ["neg", "\n\n  Loved this mouse for 3 months, absolutely everything. Then one day it started to randomly double click on the right mouse button, but only maybe once per 1,000 clicks, no big deal right? Wrong. This escalates and quickly becomes to 1 in every 10 clicks just a month after you notice the first double click issue starting. Being a \"gaming mouse\", and a reputable company, I expected more. I took the time to write the review now because after 4 months with my right click double clicking every 1 out of 10 clicks the left mouse button has started the 1 out of 1,000. My fear is that in another month I'll have the same issue with the left click. This mouse is already un-usable for gaming as any fps with scopes become unplayable as you cannot reliably ADS or hold scopes in fear that it will double click and make you lose ADS or lose your scope.\n\n"], "12": ["neg", "\n\n  This was a really great mouse prior to it developing a double left click issue under a year of use.  I did some digging online and found that this seems to be due to their mouse switches.I've been a big Logitech fan since the G15 and G9 days.  I'm currently still using a G13 and G910 but I will be avoiding Logitech mice going forward.  I'm currently thinking about going back to Razer mice due to this cheaping out on the switches issue to save a few dollars.Logitech, if you are reading this: if you need to charge an extra 5 dollars to put great switches in your mice, then DO IT!  Making cheap products like this only hurts your brand and will make people move away from you.  I went from Razer mice to Logitech because their mice had a fraying issue with their cords and Logitech was one of the first to start making them with a reinforced wire to prevent it!  Looks like I'm going back to Razer as the tables have turned now.  Fix your products Logitech!I'm just glad I still have my older G502 Proteus Core and Proteus Spectrum mice to fall back on for the time being as those had switches that don't seem to have the issue.RMA is not worth it to me as I've read the review people have had them go bad again due to their bad switches.  It's not worth my time and or money of sending this back and forth.\n\n"], "13": ["pos", "\n\n  I was a big fan of Logitech, all the mice that I have purchased for all my computers since the 1990's have been either Logitech (95%) or Razer (5%) and ive had over 20 mice over the years. I dont mistreat my mice, the reason that I usually end up replacing mice is because a newer one comes out with more buttons or features and I replace my current mouse. Unfortunately on the Logitech  G502 Hero the left mouse button starts to malfunction and to click an extra time or wont hold the left mouse button down when I have my finger held down on it (to drag objects on the screen) it will release the button without me letting go of the button effectively making it impossible to drag objects across the screen. The left mouse button will also start experiencing issues where it starts to click more than the times that you actually clicked, 1 click will register as 2-3 clicks and double clicking will register as if you clicked 4+ times.The Logitech G502 Hero that I purchased from Amazon for $68.29 on 04/18/2019 started experiencing the dreaded extra clicking and unable to hold the left mouse button down issues on 03/30/2020  (a little less than a year after purchase) and I contacted Logitech support which then had me follow several troubleshooting steps and film a video of the issue with my phone's camera and send it to them. Logitech replaced the original defective mouse for free on 04/05/2020 but now on 01/15/2021 the replacement mouse that Logitech sent me is starting to experience the same issue agian with the left mouse button clicking extra times and releasing the left mouse button when I have my finger held down without me letting go of the button, thats the second G502 Hero thats failed in under a year.Almost all the 20+ mice that I have purchased since the 1990's have been Logitech (95%) which were excellent quality and the other 5% have been Razer mice which were not as good as the Logitech mice and were overpriced. I dont really think its worth it to spend $50+ on a mouse and then have it fail at 12 months or less so this time I purchased a $20 Asus TUF M3 to replace my $68.29 Logitech G502 Hero, at least if the Asus mouse starts having the same issue at a year or less I only spent $20 on it. I hope that Logitech quality improves in the future because I was reading 3 star and under reviews online for the Logitech G502 Hero and the issues that I am experiencing seem to be pretty common (it seems that the sensor that registers the clicks is made in China and is poor quality) some people mention that they replaced the sensor that registers mouse clicks with a Japanese sensor and it got rid of the issues but im not technical enough to open up the mouse, find the replacement part online, and then put it in the defective mouse so ill just buy a replacement $20 mouse from Asus.\n\n"], "14": ["neg", "\n\n  I've always loved Logitech products, and have used them for decades because of their quality and customer service.But this mouse, even when it's working, is just above average for a gaming mouse IMO. It has high DPI settings which is nice, but mostly useless because not many people even get close to touching those settings. They're far too sensitive for the vast majority of people.The main problem with this mouse is quality. It'll last you between 6 months and a year before the left click stops working properly. There have been issues with left click problems for YEARS on Logitech mice, and it doesn't seem like they've done anything to try to fix the problem.I have 4 versions of this mouse in my house. My girlfriend has the previous non-Hero version, and that worked great for about 2 solid years of very light use before it started having issues. When you click, it double clicks. It's very frustrating and annoying.I built my daughter a computer a year ago, and got her the Hero. It worked great at first, so I decided to get me one too. Mine lasted until the RMA period was over, and then the left click stopped working. Not the typical double click problem though. Mine can't register a click+hold for long. So when you try to drag an icon on your desktop to the trash, it'll just keep dropping the icon in random places. If you try to bookmark a tab in your browser? Drag it half way and it'll suddenly let go of the tab and create a new browser window out of the tab. Try to drag mail to a folder in Outlook? It'll probably let go of the mail and drop it in the wrong folder, etc... If you have to click+hold in a game to register an action? It won't work.At this point, my daughters mouse was still working, so I thought maybe I just got a defective mouse. I went to Fry's (instead of buying on Amazon this time, because I was in a hurry) and bought the exact same mouse. It hasn't even been 6 months and it already has the same exact problem.All 4 of our Logitech mice, similar make and model, have all had problems with the left click. All of them purchased from different places over 2+ years of time. The problems I'm having aren't just a fluke. They're not a result of getting a unlucky bad mouse. There's a very good chance if you buy this mouse, you'll have similar problems within a year, even with light use. As a gaming mouse, this thing should be able to stand up to abuse, but it'll break even with light use. That makes it a BAD gaming mouse, and a bad mouse in general. Even writing this review, I tried to highlight some text to copy/paste it to another section, and I can't even do that. I had to hold shift+arrow keys to highlight the text because my mouse will just delete it or move it to some random places while I'm still holding left click/dragging. Ugh.On top of that, this mouse is fairly skinny and does not fit large hands very well. It's not comfortable at all unless you have fairly small hands. The Corsiars M65 was a much better fit for large hands, and is just as good as the G502 in pretty much every way except looks, and far better in terms of quality/longevity.As an old school Logitech fanboy, it makes me really sad to write this review.Don't buy this mouse. There's 10-20 other gaming mice out there that are just as good, and better quality. Look elsewhere.\n\n"], "15": ["neg", "\n\n  From the standpoint of how this mouse feels, it is amazing.  In the short period of time it actually works it is wonderful.  Having said that, from a quality aspect it is a pile of flaming trash.I am now on my second G502 Hero mouse.  Both have the exact same problem where the left mouse button starts double-clicking for any presses after about 3 months of use and therefore holding the mouse button does not work.Additionally, now that Logitech has reduced capacity due to COVID getting in touch with a person is impossible and the warranty submission and ticket creation systems DO NOT work.  Both take me directly back to the product page creating an endless cycle.  I also tried the \"Support Bot\" and go to the point where it asked if I wanted to create a ticket, but it just shows a repeated progress meter like it is going to do something and never actually completes.While not directly related to this issue, I also had a Logitech K810 keyboard fail, which was BEFORE COVID and the device was quickly replaced (when I could actually reach someone); however, it was within a 3 month period of having purchased that product as well.I have used Logitech products since the 1980s, but given this many failures in such short periods of time I cannot and will not recommend using their products any longer.\n\n"], "16": ["neg", "\n\n  Bought this for my husband and he really liked it however it didn\u2019t last long.

But, like all good things, electronics must come to an end.  I chose the G502 Hero to replace my beloved G500 and am rather happy with this little guy.  I'm not a gamer, I use this mouse for work mostly doing data analysis and TSQL, so my wants & needs are quite a bit different than most.Pros:- Since the weights are customizable, I still get to have the nice heavy mouse I've always loved.- Granular DPI adjustments let me set up the speed just how I like it and lets me pick and choose just the right places for the 9,485 screenshots I need to take daily to show people why they're wrong.- All buttons are able to be unassigned, so if you're not a gamer and you're worried about hitting the wrong thing, don't, it's not a big deal.- The lighting is totally customizable, so if you don't want to see cool glowing lights on your mouse, don't.  If you think it's cool, have fun.- Still ergonomic as ever.  I use mine with an old IMAK ergoBeads wrist pad and no pain.- The cord is REALLY LONG, so if your main desktop/laptop/docking device is far away, it's not a problem.Cons:- I prefer to have a clicking scroll wheel (you can also choose to have the scroll wheel free-scroll with the push of a button).  It's kind of loud.  Not loud enough to bother anyone while I'm scrolling on a conference call, but louder than the G500.- The bottom part to get to the weights is a little difficult to remove.  Once it's set though, you don't need to worry about it anymore.May this mouse give as many years as it's predecessor.\n\n"], "18": ["neg", "\n\n  I still have my MX518 from 15 years ago and the only think that has gone bad is the cable, which I easily replaced with a quick search online.

I am a casual gamer and the only one who uses my computer is me, so I know the device was not abused in any way or form.Logitech support is a joke. After wasting 2 hours trying to have a representative online, they were not able to process my RMA because their \"system\" was not able to process my serial number. So no, they just gave me a phone number. I called the phone number and it was a labyrinth of menus until finally I was able to reach the correct team. Waited and waited until I hung up exactly 15 minutes after no one replied. Take my advice and don't waste your hard earn money in a company that can't stand behind their products.  The mouse went directly into the trash bin.\n\n"], "19": ["neg", "\n\n  I ignored the reviews that reported the double-click issue. There's been times I've bought products others said were defective and never had a problem, so I figured I would still get it. That was just gambling for quality, trying to beat the odds. Boy, is my face red. Bought at the end of April, double-clicking severely by October. Trying to do anything with this mouse is now a hassle. Most games are unplayable. If I click once, I need it to register one click. Not two, three, or more. I contacted Logitech support, as it is under warranty. After about a week they responded with a process that almost completely would absolve them of having to follow through - jumping through hoops with steps up to and including a click testing website where you have to record video with your phone and send it to them to prove it. I'm not going to deal with such an absurd process, so while they may have saved on having to honor the warranty, they've lost a customer. I'll never buy a Logitech product again. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Don't buy this. You will get the same issue, almost guaranteed.Aside from the issue above, the mouse has programmable DPI settings. Which is nice, and only necessary because the default settings are weirdly too fast or too slow. The buttons to change the DPI settings is in a spot where I constantly hit them accidentally, which is annoying, but I think that's more a me problem. The RGB lights change colors, but the mouse doesn't remember that until the Logitech software you need to have is turned on. The mouse wheel either spins freely, which is stupid, or turns into a chunky megalithic clickmonster if you lock it. The scroll left/right by moving the mouse wheel left or right doesn't really work correctly. Neither does pressing in the mouse wheel to scroll up or down by holding it. It just stops. Very frustrating.Decent heavy duty cord, ergonomically ok, comfortable at least. You can change the little weights inside but I'll be honest, unless you're some kind of die-hard gamer playing semi-professionally I can't see any reason someone would need that. Ultimately, I give the whole thing two stars; it probably would have been four but it loses one for the multi click problem almost everyone seems to get, and another for the unbelievable burden their support places on people to discourage anyone from actually being able to get a fix or replacement under warranty. Bad business, that. Again - don't buy this. Odds are a cheap no-name brand would last longer.\n\n"], "20": ["pos", "\n\n  UPDATE 4/21/20: Just received a warranty replacement for the mouse. Increased my rating to 3 stars. Still unhappy that the mouse broke so quickly, especially for the price and target use.I purchased the mouse in May 2019. Beginning in March 2020, the mouse started acting funny. The left mouse button would not work correctly in 2 ways: 1) single clicks were sent as double clicks and vice versa, and 2) click-and-drag stopped working. Instead, it acted as if I released the mouse button mid-movement and then clicked again. This would have the effect of dragging a different item than I originally selected.Both of these issues affect gaming, but they also affects work, as dragging formulas in Excel or moving e-mails to folders no longer work. Also, trying to select a word or sentence by double-clicking is nearly impossible.Searching Logitech's forums, this appears to be a known issue, reported by many users.I have contacted Logitech support, but have not received a reply yet. I will update this review once/if I do. Otherwise, I would warn others to avoid a mouse that stops working correctly after only a few months.\n\n"], "21": ["pos", "\n\n  I am unfortunately replacing a mouse I really liked, the Corsair M65, which suffered from a way too early failure.  I've used Logitech mice forever and they just keep going, so that'll likely be the last time I venture off to another brand.  Comparing these two, they have a very similar size, look and feel.  This one is nearly as heavy without the weights as was the M65 with all three weights.  I think I liked the M65's aluminum construction a bit better, but the plastic on this one doesn't leave anything to be desired and the grippy material on this mouse sides is a nice touch.  This unit's button placement is far superior over the M65, I don't find myself inadvertently activating any buttons like I did with the Corsair.  The scroll resistance on this mouse wheel is also a bit better, very defined clicks and it's also adjustable to free spin if desired.  It is comfortable enough to use as an every day mouse and has optional features that can be used for gaming.  Overall, I think this is a better mouse than the Corsair and so long as it holds up, I'll keep my review at 5 stars.Update:  I'm starting to think these rather expensive gaming mice are just a cash grab.  The middle mouse button on this one failed to scroll properly after only 29 days of use.  Thank goodness I was still within the Amazon return window.  Mice have been around for a long time and the tech to make them reliable has also been around for a long time.  Something is wrong with the middle mouse button on these gaming mice, this is the second one from two different companies to fail shortly after purchase.  I'll get this one replaced, but my next mouse is going to be a cheap one.  At least they work reliably for a good long time.  This is unacceptable to have premature failures like this on $50 mice when the $12 special will go for a decade.Update 2:  The replacement mouse has held up so far, so I'm upgrading the review stars a bit.  I do have semi-frequent problems with dust getting stuck in the laser's sensor area.  When this happens, I get really bad tracking and have to blow on it to clear whatever's in there.  Not super inconvenient, but also not a \"feature\" that I've seen from any other mouse that I've used in 20 years.Update 3:  Middle mouse wheel failed at about 16 months, back down to 1 star.  I'm done with these expensive mice.  I've had mice last 10+ years, but can't get a single \"high-end gaming mouse\" to last even 2 years.  I'm either the unluckiest guy ever, or I suspect these are just a cash grab.  $13 off brand mouse it is.\n\n"], "22": ["pos", "\n\n  You can easily and quickly switch between the pre-programmed sensitivity or adjust your own sensitivity presets.

However, as a side note, there was no noticeable performance increase with the hero sensor compared to their last generation. That was to be expected since Logitech already had phenomenal sensors so any difference is probably on the test results not human use.That being said, I'll just do a quick pro, con list.Pros:- Solid construction- good button placement- buttons are light, and crisp- Decent support software whether that is Logitech gaming software or the hub.- Comparable price to competitor mice with similar features.Cons:- Scroll wheel is not rubberized like the G900 and is very hard to grip.- There is no comfort groove in the right mouse button like there is with the left (preference)- Mouse is heavy, even without the weights. If you like to do flick shots or lift your mouse up you may feel fatigue over time compared to other Logitech mice that weigh around 75grams.- Edit: There is no support for forward and backward scroll wheel as buttons in their software per this review. Would be nice to have like Roccats swarm software.Conclusion: This is a well priced product. The sensor is incredible, comparable to other brands such as Roccat, Razer, and Steel Series (among others like Zowie). It is heavy, more for larger hands, and the scroll wheel could have been rubber for grip. I'll personally use this for MOBAS and RTS but it is far too heavy for dedicated fps like Overwatch and COD. I'd personally recommend the Logitech G Pro/Pro Hero if you are an FPS player that needs fewer buttons.\n\n"], "24": ["neg", "\n\n  The design and ergonomics of this mouse are outstanding. All the buttons are placed perfectly, the freewheeling ability of the scroll wheel makes traversing long web pages or documents incredibly easy. Even the companion software doesn't give me that much to complain about.But the Chinese Omron switches Logitech puts in this mouse are terrible, and Logitech knows it.Within two months of my original purchase, I began experiencing the dreaded double click issue, and quickly opened a ticket with Logitech support. To their credit, they were able to quickly send me a replacement with very little fuss.Now, less than 10 months of only moderate use later, not only has the left click started to intermittently have the double clicking issue, but the mouse 5 button has failed entirely. I have opened another support ticket, and hope to be able to get yet another replacement, but this is unacceptable. They know these switches are bad. Consumers have had to resort to repairing the switches themselves or even buying the higher quality Japanese made Omron switches to drop in as replacements.If I do get a SECOND replacement (within only the first year of owning this mouse) I will gladly continue to use it until it too starts to display these issues, but I can't in good conscience recommend this mouse to anyone. Which is a terrible shame because I love almost everything about it, but a mouse that cannot click things as intended is not a mouse worth paying for.\n\n"], "25": ["neg", "\n\n  Many years ago Logitech was the go-to brand for computer peripherals but for the last decade my experience with their mice has been quite poor. I have Logitech webcams that after many years are still great, an illuminated keyboard that's lasted a decade and a 5.1 speaker set that's lasted even longer. My first Logitech mouse the 518 similarly lasted many years before the middle mouse button started to fail. Next I replaced it with another one which failed within a year. After that I went to a G400 that within 2 years started to have button fails / produce the double click error. Maybe it's a fluke, got another G400. Failed at about a year. Will try the G502, again not even a whole year before it started failing along with the double click error. 2nd G502 - same result 1 year. This is in a dry, temperature controlled, clean environment with no liquids or foods being spilled on it. I've already gotten the new out of retirement version of the Mx518 but if it produces the same result I'm looking elsewhere for my next mouse.Update: I tried to return the two mice I had that were within warranty. Logitech wants you to record yourself clicking the mouse over 100 times on a 3rd party site designed to check for double clicks while holding the serial number in the frame. That's just the first step of the potential return process. No more Logitech mice for me. The double click issue is well know enough by Logitech to already have a process in place for you, not them to document it, then they know its a widespread issue and should stop wasting the customers time.\n\n"], "26": ["neg", "\n\n  Update Aug 29, 2019: I submitted a support ticket to Logitech a week ago, and I have not gotten any response from their support other than the initial confirmation with the support ticket number. The same day I submitted my support ticket I went and bought a SteelSeries Rival 600 to hold me over until I would hopefully receive a replacement from Logitech, but after using the Rival 600 I can say I will not be going back to Logitech for a gaming mouse ever again.TL;DR: This mouse has a sensor issue present in both of the ones I have and the 2nd one I received directly from Logitech support had developed an issue with its right-click in only 3 months of use.I got the G502 HERO as a replacement to my long time favorite mouse the G502 Proteus Core. The decision to upgrade was due to natural wear on the Proteus Core from over years of use along with the desire to have better software support for managing mouse profiles and settings through the newer Logitech G HUB software.My first HERO mouse arrived at the beginning of April, and from day one I had some issues getting the thing configured. With the Proteus Core I had been using the Logitech Gaming Software to manage profiles, lights, and configurations but I want to make sure I was using the recommended software with the new HERO mouse. I opted to uninstall the LGS so that I could install G Hub without any worry of problem or conflict between the two pieces of software. When attempting to install G Hub it would get stuck at the \"Downloading and Installing\" part of the installer, and this was after leaving it be for almost an hour. After killing the install process, I scoured my systems for remnants of LGS from AppData folders to Registry entries to make sure I deleted anything that could cause conflict. Upon rebooting I attempted to install G Hub again only to yield the same issue I encountered before all of this taking on Windows 10 Pro 1809 at the time. Since I couldn't get the G Hub software working I figured I would have to reset or reinstall Windows to make sure the software was working with a blank slate, but I was not about to reinstall my whole OS to test that theory just to get my mouse to work so I resorted to reinstalling LGS to get my new HERO mouse configured.Now that the mouse had been configured to my preferred button layout and DPI setting, I was able to starting using it normally. To make sure everything felt normal I quickly went through a couple of my regular games to verify that my muscle memory was still relevant since the HERO is the exactly same form factor as the Proteus Core. The new mouse was proving to be what I had hoped for, barring the earlier dilemma with the software.Over the course of April I occasionally had something very strange happen while in use; at random times without predictors or warning my cursor on screen would shoot to one of the corners of my screen and get pinned there. In FPS games this would cause my character to suddenly start staring at the ground or the sky while rapidly spinning in one direction, indicating that the mouse was perceiving continuous horizontal and vertical inputs despite the mouse being stationary. This could only be interrupted by lifting the mouse off of the mousepad, a CORSAIR MM600,  and setting it back down, which would stop the constant input and everything would go back to normal. In over 6 years of gaming on PC, 3 of which were with the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, I had never encountered any issue like this with any of the Razer or Logitech mice I had used up to that point.Come mid May the issue had persisted, so I found a day to reinstall Windows 10 to the latest version 1903 in the hopes that finally being able to run the G Hub software would somehow magically fix what I believe to be a sensor issue with the mouse itself. With Windows 10 1903 installed, the G Hub software finally complete its own installation without an issue, but the cursor still continued to randomly get pinned to a corner of the screen without warning.Since I had confidently ruled out software, I decided to contact Logitech support. After explaining everything to the support agent, they decided that they would send me a new replacement mouse which arrived only a few days later. Within only a couple weeks I experienced the cursor issue again with the replacement HERO mouse from Logitech support, but it seemed to happen less often so I dealt with it.It has been over 3 months since getting the replacement and now the replacement had developed its own issue with the right-click being unable to be consistently held down.I want to love this mouse, but unless Logitech can improve their QC I cannot recommend them at this time.\n\n"], "27": ["neg", "\n\n  This is the second G502 I bought in my lifetime. I bought this to back up my G903 mouse (that also broke in under 2 years). Now, I bought this G502, because the first one I bought worked really well! It lasted a long while, no issues, and it's what has sold me on keeping on with Logi products. Well, shame on me, because I've been fooled.What's wrong with this new G502? Plenty.It just started up, and it's a doozy. The mouse, when sitting still, sends signals to my PC to move my cursor, when... I'm not even... touching the mouse? Not only that, but the mouse seems to disconnect from my pc and reset the DPI to a higher DPI than I'm comfortable with. Basically, the mouse has a spasm and just does its own thing for a little while until it decides to say hello to the pc again.What was wrong with the G903? Bad, cheap, switches. I did not learn about them until the G903 went kaput. Logi uses cheap switches doomed to fail, fantastic.After all this, I can't help but to be severely disappointed. I bought this G502 a few days ago, it already has issues. And trust me when I say, you're probably better off biting the bullet and just buying a mouse from a different brand. I certainly don't want to bother trying to get a refund from the stingy corporation that is Logi with cheap switches and horrible customer service.GG, I got played. It is what it is.

The fact that it died in only 7 months is terrible. There are some good qualities but comparing it to the downsides I just can\u2019t recommend that anyone buys it.

I cannot find a comfortable grip of this mouse. When I place my hand how it most naturally fits on the mouse, the extra buttons are out of reach.

Maybe it's the aesthetic or the fact that I usually prefer mice with more buttons (I play a lot of MMOs) but I tried a lot of alternatives before I finally decided to give in an try the G502, but boy do I wish I had just done so sooner. After having used the Logitech G Pro mouse for the last year, I decided I was ready to try something different. Don't get me wrong, the Pro is a great mouse, but it's very lightweight which I didn't find terribly comfortable to use (it makes sense in the Pro gamer context, though, so I get it.) The G502 is perfect. It's hefty, and you can customize it using the weights. The button placement is nearly perfect (I find the thumb button a tad hard to reach for my hands) and, like the Pro, the Hero engine is incredibly accurate and satisfying to use. I've ended up using it as my all day mouse, even for work, as it's just so pleasant in the hand. If you're looking for a great mouse at a very reasonable price point, give the G502 a try.

Just like my previous Logitech hardware, the buttons are sub-par.When it was working correctly, I enjoyed using this mouse.

However, it is having the same \"press the left mouse button once it automatically double clicks issue\" that my previous trackball developed.

In order to be able to use them for console (at least for xbox) for anything other than dpi adjustment, you will need to download the Logitech program on a computer and re-map those buttons. I found some videos for it on youtube but long story short, you will need to map those 3 dpi buttons to another button on the keyboard that you don't use for gaming. Once you've done that, go to the mouse and keyboard button mapping settings on whatever game you are playing and map those random keyboard buttons that you set the dpi buttons to, to whatever you actions you want it to complete. For example, if you want the dpi increase button to be \"reload\", on your computer, map that dpi increase button to, let's say, \"[\". Then open up your game settings on your console and map \"reload\" to \"[\". Then when you press the dpi increase button on your mouse, the console will think you are clicking \"[\", and your ge will recognize \"[\" as how you want to reload and will reload.The YouTube videos are probably easier to understand, but hey, I tried.

If you dont know what Gshift is, its like rolling your hotkeys in MMORPGS.

I couldn't do this with my Corsair Glaive Pro and tbh, spending $60 then compared to this made me regret everything. The program that comes with this mouse is foreign at first, but in the end, gets simple to use. I have both the Ique (Corsiar keyboard) paired with this mouse and both run great with each other. This app like the ique (program for corsair), can both pair games to profile, so as you launch the game, it switches to that specific profile without you having to change the macros all the time.I personally dont like the looks, but the utility of this mouse, makes me love the heck out of this. If you are looking for the best under $50 gaming mouse, this has to the the top pick in my opinion. Do yourself a favor when you bu this mouse - learn it, and learn about all the different things you can do it with. Trust me its worth knowing the hundreds of different configs and things you can do with this mouse and the program together.\n\n"], "39": ["pos", "\n\n  I am writing this after having the mouse a day and a half, so things may change.  So far this mouse is working great for me both in Linux and Windows as I am using it through a KVM.  My previous older gaming mouse had a few different limitations that really stuck out once I went up to higher resolution and could more consistently hold higher frame rates.  Basically at the higher display capabilities my old mouse movements looks rather stuttery and jerky.  This mouse has solved this with some rather quick and easy tuning.  So for a run down on how this has improved over an older generation gaming mouse is:1. Turned down mouse sensitivity in Windows, Linux, and in games.  At the same time turned up DPI resolution on the mouse.  The main thing you are really after is turning off \"mouse acceleration\".  The difference in smoothness is night and day.  I simply did not have the mouse resolution and responsiveness before, at least for first person shooters.  With this mouse and a few quick tweaks I do.2. Can run this mouse on smoother, very low static friction free surfaces.  My older gaming mouse just did not have the sensor for this, so it would stick on the mouse pad a little and then the movement would be a little jerky as it transitioned to kinetic friction.  This mouse can do it, so problem solved.3. This mouse allows balancing with weights.  I guesstimated where I thought I needed the weights and so far it is working out pretty nice.  The previous gaming mouse had a wireless option with a battery in the back and especially with my big hands not making much contact with the back of the mouse, this would cause things to shift around and not track quite right.For my recommendations to get the most out of Linux is to:1. Setup under Windows.  The mouse has a memory, so once it is setup under Windows, it is setup everywhere in terms of DPI settings and polling rate.2. In Linux (I am doing this under Ubuntu 18.04, but should work with any distro) first order of business is to disable acceleration.  Create the file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.confand enter in the following:Section \"InputClass\"  Identifier \"My Mouse\"  Driver \"libinput\"  MatchIsPointer \"yes\"  Option \"AccelProfile\" \"flat\"  Option \"AccelSpeed\" \"0\"EndSection3. Restart your X server by logging out and back in.4. Make mouse adjustments such as sensitivity levels in X windows and in games and enjoy!  The main games to benefit from this are FPS (first person shooter) games.  Other games any old mouse will do, but it wasn't those games that pushed you to get this mouse, right?As a summary, even within a few hours of having this mouse I am finding that I am not getting nauseous as much with FPS gaming, movement looks a lot smoother, and I am quickly getting in a lot more shots and especially a lot more sniping head shots.  Even in a window manager doing things like grabbing the edge of a window to move it around is a lot easier now.While some may debate whether this mouse is as good as another mouse currently on the market, at least going from an older generation gaming mouse to this one is a big improvement.  I suppose my only qualm so far is I fired up the utility in Windows to configure it where Linux is my primary OS.  Also while some people say DPI does not matter, it seems like it helps when you turn off mouse acceleration and then use higher DPI resolutions to compensate along with a good polling rate.  I would consider the result from this mouse once finding the right settings to be \"perfect tracking\".\n\n"], "40": ["pos", "\n\n  As an entry level gaming mouse it's decent.

I think it's over complicated for mouse only.  Others' may be better or worse, I don't know.  I don't tend to save macros or do any custom programming.  I prefer to just change dpi and the LED.

Suddenly, the cursor is flying across the screen so fast I can't find it and I have to stop and hit the \"slower\" button to return to the speed I want.

Razer is usually overpriced and doesn't feel that great. Logitech comes in clutch.This thing is built like a tank. It's heavy. It's solid.

Getting used to it takes about two to three days, but when you do, its like wow, why didn't we normalize this sooner.I play league and wow, genshin impact, stardew valley, and almost any survival horror game that comes out. Works great for everything. As well I use this in my recording studio as my macro mighty mouse. Keybinding things on the go for quick and easy access. Again, works great. 10/10This is far superiors to any other mmo mouse out IMO.My only gripe is because its so big, and if you have little hands, you might get some wrist, hand cramps. If I game for 10+ hours it really starts to become an issue. So take that for what you will. This isn't just the logitech, all big mice do it. Just know that its fat and thiccc, and feels amazing. Just too much of an amazing thing can sometimes get to be a bother.\n\n"], "44": ["pos", "\n\n  I've had the mouse for a little while now. First, I want to say that if you're on the fence about this mouse, then just go for it. It's a great mouse.Pros:Removable weights allow you to customize how hefty it is in hand. I added all the weights and enjoy it being a heavier mouse.DPI settings are great. Really let's you set your sensitivity level and quickly make changes to it based on what you're doing.Customizable lighting. You will need to download the app, but you can change the lighting to what color you want and also how it lights up or reacts to sound.Ergonomics. This mouse feels great in the hand. I have large hands and it still feels great to me. The grips and textures compliment your hand quite well and I've not had any issues with it.Cons:DPI buttons are a little too close to the left mouse button. This has caused me to inadvertently change DPI settings a few times. It's easy and fast to switch back, but can be annoying.Width. As noted, I have large hands. So this may only apply to others like me. I feel this mouse could be wider for a better fill of my hand. However, it might be too much for others with smaller hands.Overall, the negatives are minimal at best. This has been an amazing mouse so far and I'm really enjoying it.\n\n"], "45": ["pos", "\n\n  Pros:Solid sensor, good programmable button options, software worked well on Windows 10 and Mac OSX.Wired, so no dealing with batteries, chargers, connections, or lag. The rubber on the side grips feels good.Settings can be saved to onboard memory, so the color and speed and button tweaks work on any machine, not just ones with the driver and your profile installed, unlike Razor.Cons:Feels light/cheap even with the added weights, like every piece of plastic was as thin as they could make it without it shattering during shipping.The scroll wheel wobbles just slightly left and right (it is supposed to move left right when pushed, but I mean just by moving the mouse on the desk, the wheel flops a 1/2 millimeter back and forth, causing a distracting rattle. It does it less when you turn off freewheel and use clicky wheel, but it's still audible there, too.Some settings don't seem to be editable in onboard memory, you have to download the profile, update it there, then re-upload it. Wouldn't be a big deal, but you can't even view the button customizations without downloading, it just tells you how many buttons were programmed, not what they do.Not built for large hands - feels 80% of normal size. For example my thumb can't rest in the thumb slot below the two side buttons; with my thumb resting against the bottom of the groove, the top of my thumb is still against the two top buttons, not nestled into the recess below them.\n\n"], "46": ["neg", "\n\n  Bought it thinking I was getting a good deal since it was on sale for $40 at the time of purchase. As it would be a good replacement after the micro switches in my G9x died. The profile is bit high and it kind of hurts my index finger, its as if my index and middle fingers are slightly extended. I'm not sure if I have a defective product but the mouse wheel is off balanced. If you slowly move the mouse wheel up in increments (as if you're browsing a webpage), the wheel will slightly rock backwards.  At first I thought it was some kind of issue with the scroll bar in my browser, spent a good evening trying to locate a bug in Chrome that didn't exist, and it was the mouse wheel the entire time. Looked up the issue online and apparently this is a common production flaw with the G502 series. The only real fix is to buy a replacement mouse wheel but for G500/G500s and swap it in. If you're shopping around for a Logitech mouse, please try and avoid any mice with this mouse wheel type.Furthermore, having to use G Hub to program the mouse is an absolute nightmare of an experience, honestly I think I hated having to use that software than the issue with the mouse wheel.

The programmable buttons on this mouse have weak action and are easy to press by accident. The previous logitech mouse I used for years (sadly no longer available) worked much better. I would be willing to put up with this inferior replacement for its predecessor except after a couple of weeks it started misbehaving. The cursor would start randomly moving. The mouse was sending a continual \"right\" or \"up\" or other signal to the computer.  Sometimes the mouse would return to normal use with some vigorous scrolling. Sometimes I would have to disconnect/reconnect the USB to get it to work again. The final straw was when I accidentally deleted a document when the mouse decided to move just as I was clicking.I looked around the internet and apparently this has been a common problem for years that Logitech cannot be bothered to fix. I tried seven \"solutions\" to the problem including new drivers, new firmware, and turning off power saving features.  Nothing worked.I was also sad to see the Logitech, after all these years, is still using the most counter-intuitive app to program the mouse I have ever seen. Until Logitech decides that quality is important I am done with their mice.\n\n"], "50": ["neg", "\n\n  I'll preface this by saying I've pretty much been a one-brand guy for the last 10+ years when it comes to computer peripherals - pretty much every mouse, keyboard, and webcam I've purchased since starting to build computers has been a Logitech product. This mouse was great...while it lasted. About 6 months after purchasing, the mouse lost the ability to hold a left-click. In other words, you'd click and hold the left mouse button to drag something, but the mouse would let off the hold even though you were still holding the left mouse button down. This makes any task that involves dragging and dropping (or drawing something by holding the left mouse button) infuriating if not impossible. After reading around, it sounds like it's a known hardware issue with this mouse. Unfortunately, Logitech's support answer is to try spraying compressed air in the mouse to clear any debris - this did not work. I submitted a support request to Logitech and haven't heard back in a week. I certainly won't buy another G502 to replace this one, and I'll have to consider other brands based on this experience.\n\n"], "51": ["neg", "\n\n  This is absolutely the best mouse that I've ever owned. But you need to understand that the issues mentioned in review after review are correct and widespread. If Logitech were to actually fix these issues, they'd likely have about 99% of the market.The issue for mine occurred in the right button and involved double clicks/the button not recognizing being held. It was a hardware issue, not a software one as I had a separate Logitech to test the software. The mouse button was even tested on two computers as well.The same issue has just started to pop up for a friend as well with their system. Double clicks/phantom presses/non-consistent presses.Save yourself the aggravation and find a more reliable mouse, even if this one will be the best one you'll ever have (until issues pop up). I guess this is why the G502 has been taken off quite a few updated mouse buying guides.\n\n"], "52": ["pos", "\n\n  First thing I noticed, the free spinning of the scroll wheel is completely useless.  I thought for a moment I was going to have to return the mouse, then realized there's a button to turn off free spin.  But!  Then it's super clunky, better, not great.  Continuing with the scroll wheel, using the associated button is hit or miss.  I play FPS shooters and this is a button I use often.  Half the time it seems to not trigger until I let go of pushing it and then the timing is completely off, obviously.The three buttons on the left side of the mouse:  I have decent sized hands, I'm 6'1\"  I have to reach back with my thumb to get to one of them (most used of course) and this is super uncomfortable.  There's a sticky area for grip by your thumb that really should have been the place to put the side mouse buttons, they would have been much easier to use.The movement seems fine so far.  The issues really stem from button placement and a VERY horrible scroll wheel.I would not get this mouse again even though it's #1 in computer mice category at the time of this review.  I don't know if I can return it after a couple weeks use, but, I'm going to see.For reference, I came from a Logitech MX518 and wanted more buttons which is what brought me to this mouse.\n\n"], "53": ["neg", "\n\n  I am so very disappointed with this mouse, so-called one of the best gamer mouse at the moment. I couldn't stand using it for more than an hour, and had to switch back to my cheap, 6-year-old, discontinued, MSI Interceptor DS200. I wish I've done more research before buying and did not get carried away with the gamer community reviews.There are two main reasons for me not liking this mouse: the wheel (which is poorly designed in many ways) and the Logitech software.In almost every other aspect the mouse is very good. It looks great, very comfortable for the hand, and the thumb button setup is just perfect.THE WHEEL, OMG THE WHEEL...How a little part can be so flawed to totally ruin the experience? The very first thing you will notice when you unbox the mouse is that the wheel is released and will spin freely. After freaking out for a second you will also notice that there is a button that will lock the wheel allowing for the use we all like and need.However, there are three problems with the locked wheel: The first is that it is extremely noisy, more than you can imagine. The second is that it does not scroll easily, the movement is not smooth at all. And the third is that the wheel is made of metal, which causes your finger to slide occasionally (when the wheel is locked) and miss a few scrolls, which is a big flaw.And finally, there is the rattling sound. As soon as you start moving the mouse with moderate speed you will feel like something is loose in the inside. It is the wheel, again, moving from side to side, clashing against the plastic, and this is very, very annoying. There are some YouTube tutorials that teach you how to stick a tape on the side to prevent the rattling. Although I'm not into cheap hacks to my new hardware I was about to accept all these flaws and try to get used to them as soon as possible. But then I met the Logitech software problem...LOGITECH VS LOGITECHI have a Logitech G910 keyboard which I love and I have been using for quite some time, along with the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS). The LGS is supposed to detect your Logitech hardware and let you configure all of them from one place. However, despite my efforts LGS never detected my G502 mouse.That left me no choice but to download and install G-Hub, a newer Logitech software that is supposed to be better than LGS. But it's not, It's actually much worse, although it did detect my keyboard and my mouse.G-Hub is poorly designed, it is bugged and it is missing many cool features that LGS had, making a hassle out of the simpler tasks like coloring your keyboard for a specific game, or keeping a custom default DPI for the mouse. Also, the import feature for your LGS profiles is just broken. G-Hub wont import anything and you will lose all your LGS customizations and macros.Ok, I thought: maybe I can use G-Hub for the mouse and LGS for the keyboard. Nope, Logitech wont let you use both, and as soon as you install G-Hub it will block LGS.I was not keen to ruin my experience with the G-910 in order to use a flawed mouse, so I decided I will not use the G502 for now.I live outside of the US and getting a refund is not an option. Besides, the mouse is not broken, it's just flawed by design.\n\n"], "54": ["pos", "\n\n  So, this mouse is really good for what it's supposed to do, which is be a mouse. It responds well, I haven't had any of the issues I normally do with other brands such as Corsair, like buttons not responding, registering 2 clicks when it was only one, the wheel giving out or just generally dying after a few months.But at the same time the design is frankly, just weird. The left click button is on the thin side, which I never seem to have an issue with having thin fingers myself. But right beside the left click button are 2 buttons that will adjust the speed of your pointer on screen and these 2 buttons are entirely too easy to misclick with even the slightest shift of your finger.You can adjust the speed the pointer changes too with each click on the logitec app, but I cannot seem to get the fastest button to go below 3000 dpi, the app simply stops at that number and won't go below it, so I go from my standard slow mouse speed, that I love to one that shoots my pointer across the screen so fast I can't find it half the time. Causing a lot of unnecessary and aggravating deaths or stealth breaks. I would buy this mouse again, but it would have to be without those 2 buttons, or at least have a function on the app that doesn't force me into an insane dpi.\n\n"], "55": ["neg", "\n\n  This Logitech G502 Hero mouse is garbage. I own three and within 6-9 months of light-to-moderate use in a climate-controlled room, all three now consistently double-click on a single press, or release the click while I\u2019m still holding the button down. This makes FPS games impossible as releasing the right mouse button will un-scope my ranged weapon. For regular use, accidental double clicks will open files or links I didn\u2019t intend to.  I have accidentally opened a few folders, only to have to use my keyboard to go back safely. A gaming mouse only has two real functions: tracking movements (this mouse did this well), and clicking properly (frustratingly bad). I\u2019ve since replaced all three with Corsair mice for less cost, and those mice\u2019s buttons are rated in the millions of clicks. I will not purchase Logitech again.\n\n"], "56": ["neg", "\n\n  The mouse feels great, just like my 6 year old g502 that finally bit the bullet on me. Good weight, good cable, scrolling and buttons all feel good.The one huge giant issue I've already run into in my first week of owning it is the new version of the horrible \"G HUB\" software. It constantly ignores my profile and button assignments. I have the mouse set to use 400 dpi with all profile switching and DPI switching buttons disabled. At least once a day I need to un plug and re plug in my mouse as it seems to go to the default 1200 dpi, and ignores all my configured buttons. This alone really makes the mouse feel like a huge pain in the butt, and a real step down from the previous model. I hope this gets fixed in the near future, because I don't see myself sticking out with these annoying problems for another 5 years.\n\n"], "57": ["neg", "\n\n  For an item that supposedly lists for $100 retail, this thig really has some seriously poor quality workmanship and materials: The mouse wheel is made of some cheap plastic with NO rubber or layer of grip that will provide traction for your finger when scrolling and especially when attempting to use the left and right wheel buttons, my finger just slides right off. The mechanical aspects of the wheel also are very poor, as the \"free wheel\" and the \"resistance mode\" of the mouse feel pretty much the same, resistance mode I can almost free spin the mouse to the same extent of free wheel. Added to the fact that it just feels clunky, loose, and wobbles around making a rattling sound when Im using it. I was feeling more like the mouse wheel was made for some $3 trash mouse you would buy in a swap meet and they just threw it in there.I dont know exactly what it was about the design, but from the first moment I used it, it just felt wrong in my hand. Perhaps it was just some small aspect of how they designed the body but it really felt like the fit was just off.The programable buttons were decent, and the software was pretty easy to figure out and worked fine, the only issue I had with it was that some of the games I have installed, very popular games, it would not recognize on a search and I had to add them in manually.They could also start using optical switches for the main buttons which would make me feel better about the longevity and accuracy of the item as well.Considering their closest competitor has made a product without these glaring flaws it may behoove Logitech to get on the ball and make some serious design changes. Im sending this one back.\n\n"], "58": ["neg", "\n\n  I got this to attempt to replace my wonderful, but old and failing, Logitech G700s mouse.It has fewer buttons and they are arranged differently from the 700s model.  I use it for productivity and not gaming, so the buttons are for copying, deleting and moving around web pages.  The 2 by 2 side buttons of the G700s are perfect for my hand and the left top row of buttons is perfect for page up and down scrolling.  This G520 has three side buttons instead of four which are spaced in an \"L\" shape instead of a rectangle of two and two.  It has the same three top, left edge buttons, but they are spaced further apart with less tactile feel.This model suffers from a design or manufacturing flaw.It has a replaceable bottom plate that covers a recessed area where you can install thin pieces of metal to change the weight of the mouse.  The design or manufacture of this unit made the bottom plate sit higher than the rest of the mouse.  So when you press one of the main buttons, the mouse rocks forward and then back.  That causes the laser tracker to move your cursor.  So you point and click, but the mouse moves the cursor a little, so you miss your target.  Removing and keeping the bottom plate off allows the mouse to work just fine.  The weights are friction fit, so they stay in place.  I'm afraid to bump the mouse too hard, though, as that might dislodge one or more of the weights.The Logitech Gaming Software works well enough but is not intuitive or easy to master for productivity.  It seems the manufacturers of mice aren't aware that multi-button mice are being used for productivity as well as gaming.I marked it down one star for the software and button arrangement, and down two more stars for the bottom plate defect.\n\n"], "59": ["neg", "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Hype and marketing aside, this mouse has serious flaws, immediate quality control ones as well as general design ones.The BAD:This mouse doesn\u2019t glide side-to-side or up-and-down as much as it scratches and grinds all over the place. Issue here is the new and NOT improved weight system. Unlike the old push-of-a-button slide out tray on G500, the boomerang shaped weights need to be wedged into the bottom of the mouse once you pop the side corner and peel off the underside. (By the way, this is completely counter intuitive and not mentioned in the tiny sheet of a paper that passes for a \u201cmanual\u201d. Instead you are supposed to find an official YouTube video by Logitech describing the procedure. What?! What happened with the button-push system?) The entire door is held, barely at that, by a super weak 1g magnet and two tiny plastic latches that seem like a major part endurance oversight. (No way they won\u2019t break at some point in the future).As reported on reddit and elsewhere, the mouse underside weights compartment door does not close all the way. There is some give and it makes the mouse uneven on the bottom. That said, even removing the weights AND the door entirely, the mouse will still scratch and grate since the mouse feet elsewhere were positioned unevenly ( There are no feet positioned on right side at all for example, which makes the mouse uneven door-issue-aside.). All of this can be mitigated by not using the G502 on a hard surface like wood, glass, or those new \u201cpro-gamer\u201d plastic or metal pads. But even on a cloth mat after a few hours there were tracks and tiny rips in the cloth material. Wow, Logitech!? How the mighty have fallen!Another issue is plastic. Cheap plastic everywhere that is. Nowadays even never-heard-of-brands making \u201cCool Gamer RGB overload\u201d mice for $10-$15 come with rubberized coating. Other than the side grips, the entirety of G502 is cheap slick plastic which will make the mouse slide around\u2026 well, grind around let\u2019s be honest. Also, it has been shrunken in all possible dimensions compared to G500. It is narrower, shorter and much lower than the G500. Seems like something designed for your average teenage/tween hand, which I\u2019m sure is the target demographic now anyway.All in all, all of the above can explained by down-costing. This mouse (G502) screams \u201ccut-costs\u201d, for the manufacturer that is. You, the user, are still expected to pay 2 to 2.5 times as much as you did for the G5 or G500 10-15 years ago while getting something much inferior. Smaller, more plasticky with horrible QC and design decisions. (The underside of the mouse does not shut clean making the bottom of the mouse uneven? How was this overlooked?! And then made by the million?)The GOOD:The sensor is top notch. While not majorly improved, the increase in precision is noticeable and measurable vs G500 for instance. Jitter is lower and bizarre acceleration issues seem to be non-existent on G502. Cord is pretty nice. Extremely flexible and seems to be of high quality. Something easily frayed G500 cord could have used. Logitech software is still intuitive, relatively low resource, and available in most common language including English.Summary:Downcosted all around, overly plasticky, poor quality control, worse than poor design choices, lack of rubberized coating where needed, shrunken, shrunken, tiny, TINY, mouse. 10 years ago this would have been a\u2026 well, still a downgrade to a G500, but not many options were as available back then, so it might have been an option of some  kind. Now, even no-name \u201cGamer-Cool\u201d brands come with decent enough software, (macros, RGB configurability, profiles, DPI tweaking and all), rubberized coating, latest Pixart sensors, weight systems, you name it, all for under $20, sometimes even for under $15. It seems the no-names have gotten a bit better, if not a whole lot better and name brands like Logitech have gotten a bit worse and down-costed to the absolute maximum, so now everything sits in the middle and luck-of-the-draw is what rules the day and the mouse pad.I would say G502 is on par with your average random $15 no-name brand \u201cGamer-Cool\u201d mouse on Amazon, but even those have rubberized coating, proper height and size for a grown man\u2019s hand, and actual metal feet. How the mighty have fallen...\n\n"], "60": ["pos", "\n\n  Been using Logitech mice for decades, love the features, the customization, the utility, the ergonomics, & this mouse does well in most of those categories. But, for me anyway, for my uses it has a major flaw: It's kind of small, so anyone who uses a Palm Mouse Grip will find it uncomfortable.To explain, my previous mouse on my main gaming desktop was a Logitech G700, & that mouse is large enough that my hand \"sits\" on it, so during my gaming sessions my hand can \"rest\" on top of it. That factor comes into play during long/er gaming sessions, because to a large degree it majorly reduces hand fatigue & maximizes comfort. A larger mouse fills up your hand, which enables you to not have to adopt an unnatural hand position to grip it, because having to adjust your hand in order to grip your mouse correctly or press the side buttons makes your hand tired, & more importantly, contributes to carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms.But this mouse is small/er, so I have to use a modified Claw Grip on it, & using that grip makes me hand hurt. I've used Palm Grip gaming mice for so long, I may be able to adjust somewhat to using Claw Grip mouse, but the whole reason I stopped using Claw Grip mice is because it gave me hand pain & carpal tunnel.I'm disappointed because I really like the RGB & the features of the new Logitech 'G' software, but I will most likely be returning this mouse.\n\n"], "61": ["neg", "\n\n  I wanted to like this mouse. I like the position of the buttons (particularly the toggle DPI that lets you have a \"snipe\" button - more mice need that) and the general shape of the mouse, but it's just got so many problems, including abysmal build quality (which is shocking for logitech)For starters, it's weirdly draggy and a bit heavy, even wired and with zero weights in it. I can't see anyone wanting to add more of the included weights - the point of this kind of mouse is to start LIGHT and let you tune it, not start heavy and let you make it worse. Genuinely heavier than my full size WIRELESS teknet mouse that I use for my media PC.The feet lasted okay, they're starting to feel worn after a year of use on an aluminum banshee pad mousepad (I usually got about 2-3 years out of a set of feet on a Razer Deathadder) And they're very sensitive to picking up schmutz. Replacement feet are not readily found, you're gonna be using teflon tape. The combination of really meh feet and really heavy/draggy weight makes the mouse wildly imprecise after only a couple months. Even with teflon tape over the feet, I still can't make a \"clean\" drag across my mousepad with a smooth cursor movement. Not even sure it would when it was new. The  aforementioned teknet mouse still absolutely glides after years. I think it's just because the 502 has SIX absolutely gigantic pads, and other mice I use tend to have 3 or 4 much smaller feet at most, which keeps the inherent friction lower.Cord is okay if used with a mouse bungie.The scroll wheel is abysmal. It has a side/side rock, which is already not good for a proper gaming mouse (they all have a habit of mis-registering mouse 3 clicks) but this is easily the worst I've ever experienced. I am used to the design, but this one is so bad and vague that I had to straight up disable the rocker, so now I only get about 15% of my middle clicks mis-sensed. The ability to unlock a scroll wheel is nice when I have to turbo scroll through a 300 page document, but again, in GAMING practice, is just one more way the scroll wheel feels incredibly vague and inaccurate.mouse 4 is just set too far back. You have to press it with the knuckle of your thumb, which requires an incredibly awkward \"palm pinch\". If you use all the mouse buttons in a game, you're going to hate this thing so much.And the thing is INCREDIBLY fragile. My first one's left click broke just sliding off my chair onto carpet, the whole mouse button itself sheared off. The second one's L2 switch itself is now failing, as it registers right click but doesn't register HOLDING it. After only a year, this is appalling. If you play MMO's, this makes steering an absolute nightmare. If you play FPS games, right click iron sight/scope becomes agony.And there's something about this mouse that gives me really sweaty palms, which is weird because I have a kind of hybrid palm/fingertip grip that keeps my palm usually hovering just above the mouseMy deathadder was only replaced by this mouse because I suspected the skin flakes embedded in the chassis had evolved a new form of life. This one is getting hucked in the garbage because it fell to pieces in a little over a year and a half. I am staying away from Logitech for a few years after two absolutely atrocious peripherals and going back to the good old iron duke of a Razer Deathadder.\n\n"], "62": ["neg", "\n\n  I used a Proteus version for a decade. It was an amazing mouse, never had issues.Had to get a new one and only Hero was available. Figured a newer version would be better. Wrong.Lots of people are plagued by weird \"stuttering\" on this mouse. You can google it and find dozens on dozens of reports of it, with virtually no solutions. Just people guessing and trying random things. Lots of placebo and then they come back and report the issue came back.I've tried all these steps and more:-Reinstalling logitech-uninstalling any and all mouse drivers-disabling any RGB controlling software like Gigabyte RGB Fusion someone claimed messed with it-disable \"allow games to control RGB\"-Reducing mouse polling rates-Different USB ports-Disabling USB power suspension in Windows 10-Cleaning the sensor-Cleaning the mouse pad-Changing the mouse pad.I previously had an acrylic mouse pad. Hard surface. Logitech G Hub used to have a \"tuning\" option where you could tinker with settings and calibrate the mouse to that mouse pad. Worked great with Proteus.Hero doesn't have that and/or Logitech removed the tuning option entirely. So this option which possibly would fix the issue is no longer available.I bought 2 new mouse pads that I didn't want - soft fabric type and one that is a bit thicker fabric like a traditional mouse pad. At first I thought maybe it improved but I still get the issue. The mouse will stutter especially if I try to move fast to click something precise, or highlight text. I have shaky hands sometimes but this thing looks like I'm taking the mouse off the matt or something. Which, interestingly, is a nice way to reproduce the issue. If you raise the mouse slightly off the matt, it will exhibit similar stuttering on demand.Logitech ceased responding to me when I raised the issue.Such a disappointment.\n\n"], "63": ["pos", "\n\n  This mouse is precision.

Nice to be able to change dpi on the fly.Where it shines:  Precision and smooothe sliders make it a snag free accurate mouse, clicky scroll wheelmouse cable never noticed while in use.  A+++  (don't pay more for wireless)Where it fails:  Size of an animal mouse. Might be for a specific type of grip style?  Cat food style?Meaning, it fits fine if you use your pinky and ring finger pads to push into the right side of it.I drag my pinky and ring finger very loosely off the right side, on to the mouse pad.ANY other grip is PAINFUL.  If you do not drag your 2 extra fingers on the table, you end up holding them up with nothing to support them underneath.  That will cause your fingers to wear out quickly, say in 2 minutes.  I'm NOT SAYING it doesn't work WELL, just that it has extremely limited grip styles.  I personally prefer for the mouse to support my other fingers.  I am paying the mouse after all.  Lazy brat mouse.  Anyway The G 502 is functionally awesome, ergonomically lacking for large (meaning AVERAGE sized adult MALE) hands.  to the point I would strongly consider Razer's horrible bloat ware if i were able to try this out before buying it.

Also, what to do when one runs out of mouse pad?  Why, lift the mouse and bring it back to the middle, of course.The G502 is a great mouse except it's difficult to use without activating one of the G4 or G5 buttons, especially when lifting to reposition.  One of the reasons for this is the sides of the mouse body are too straight up and down which cause ones fingers to slide up.  Coupled with the thumb scoop area being too small--even in normal use, ones thumb is very close to those buttons-- that in the heat of battle, they're far, far, too easy to accidentally press and, poof, you lost that battle.Overall the mouse seems robustly built but I feel that all of the switches activate with too light and too shallow of a press.  Otherwise, it's a great gaming mouse except the thumb scoop needs to be bigger/deeper.  Likewise (but to a lesser degree) the finger scoop on the other side of the body.

I've got 5 broken G502s in the past year that don't last 4-6 months before it starts having quality issues.  Issues I've encountered:  1) double-click on single for both left and right, rarely at the same time.  2) Mouse wheel gets stuck in a push (I barely use the mouse wheel as is, but seen it get stuck in the shift function) 3) Mouse wheel keeps spinning after touch (basically, the weight is off and keeps spinning until it corrects where it thinks it wants to be, not where user places wheel).  Throwing in a fourth item that is software Logitech GHub focused, not so much on the mouse but is impacted:  4) software updates requires a system reboot and locks all functionality until restarted.Like I said, this used to be a great product and well produced.  If it was 1 out of 5 purchases, I could say maybe a manufacturing defect on that one device.  Unfortunately, it's been 5 out of 5 over the past two years; I seriously doubt it's a one time bad batch product issue.Looking at other gaming mice for future enjoyment.  Dropping Logitech from future considerations.Usage:  standard games from RPGs to FPS; office work.

Boy was I wrong!Let\u2019s start with the software: I installed it easily enough but it wouldn\u2019t recognize the mouse. Fine, restarted and it still wouldn\u2019t, uninstalled and reinstalled and restarted before connecting: now it finally did. Great, except figuring out how to program the buttons was a pain largely because it was bugging out hard and things wouldn\u2019t show, I only found out after I had to turn my laptop off to go somewhere else and turning it on again.Finally, after wasting my lunch and half an afternoon trying to figure it out, I managed to set it up. Great! Except scrolling was inverted and it would go up when I tried scrolling down and viceversa.\u201cOk, I\u2019ll fix that on settings\u201d there was no option on settings, so I fixed that on Apple configuration.

Cue more time wasted on a solution I could not find.Finally I gave up, willing to suck it up and enjoy my shortcuts that change from program to program, that would be dreamy, at least. Except it wasn\u2019t, because no sooner had I started enjoying them when they stopped working for no reason.So it\u2019s back to troubleshooting. More wasted time, more restarts and more reinstalls and setups later and best I would get was a couple hours of work before shortcuts crapped out again.I really wanted this to work so I asked for a replacement.

I wanted something that had the same similar style with enough buttons for my MMO games and a thumb rest. Long story short, I thought for 40 bucks I was getting a cheaper quality mouse compared to my other one. Instead I received a great quality mouse that felt better in my hand and even shocked me with its great remapping software. The integrated games mapping is awesome. Before I had to go into a game and find the mapping to make a profile on my mouse and remap that to whatever button I wanted. With the Logitech software it scans the games and tells you exactly what mappings do what. It's kind of hard to explain but it makes things so much easier! If you try this out you'll see what I mean.

I prefer how the G700s felt in my hands to this, but that's probably just personal preference. The DPI shift button (the button by the thumb) feels too far forward for me, but I probably just need to get used to it. My main issue with the mouse itself is that I find myself accidentally clicking the left mouse button pretty often with the G502, so I think buttons are quite a bit lighter/easier to press on this mouse.The thing that I really dislike the most about this mouse is  G Hub, the software Logitech pretty much forces you to use if you want to get the most out of the mouse. Yes, there is onboard memory for five different profiles, but it's not nearly as convenient to access and change these onboard profiles as it was with the previous Logitech software: Logitech Gaming Software. LGS was also faster, used fewer system resources, and more intuitive than G Hub. Overall, better in all the ways that count. But it looks like Logitech won't let you use the old LGS software with this mouse anymore.Overall, I'm pretty displeased with this mouse. The only reason I bought it, is because it was on sale.

It also feels incredibly cheap, especially the scroll wheel which feels very flimsy. The scroll wheel is also annoyingly loud when not in frictionless mode. It does not have a smooth clicking sound like the G700s, but sounds like its grinding. Frictionless mode is really loose scrolling up and down pages, far more than a G700s.Ergonomically its smaller than a G700s, sitting much lower and does not feel like any the older G-series mice, forcing me to uncomfortably extend my wrist. It seems like it may be better suited for a child.The other reviews make me question if I got the real thing. Amazon can be like Russian roulette on hardware. If this is a legit Logitech product, I am not happy.

Bought back when they were in the $100 range.  Loved the mouse.  So naturally its hard not to go for the updated version for $41 since mine is getting ragged.  Saw that the special edition was $29 but not digging the black and white scheme.  Much rather have the all black and since that was the only difference, I paid the extra $12 for the regular version.  Weird.Honestly I really wanted to go to a the wireless G502 but since its literally a $110 up charge ($41 vs $149) for being cordless, theres no way.  Shame on you Logitech for being ridiculous in your cordless pricing.  Oh well.  I'm happy as every with my new G502 and should be for another 2-3 years I imagine.**EDIT** 12/25/19Have to send this back for a replacement.  The mouse wheel buttons are defective.  If you press down on the middle mouse button it presses the left and right side wheel buttons as well (randomly).  The left and right wheel buttons are ridiculously sensitive to the slightest touch.  They even get pressed when I'm just using the wheel and not meaning to press a button.  Really hoping this is a defect in this particular mouse and not a widespread problem with the new HERO line of the G502.  My old G502 has no issue with this whatsoever even after years of hard use.**EDIT** 12/27/19First off, big ups to AMAZON for sending me a replacement so quickly!  Great customer service.  Bad news is it seems the issue I am having wasn't a one off problem.  You literally can't click the middle mouse button without clicking a left or right side wheel click simultaneously.  I hope I am explaining this right.  I guess it would be buttons 10 and 11 that depress when you push the mouse wheel left or right.  I bind all 11 mouse buttons for games and nearly every time I click the middle mouse, it clicks button 10 or 11 as well.  I've decided to keep the mouse because its still a great everyday driver but for a gaming mouse, I wouldn't recommended it if you like to use the middle mouse click.\n\n"], "74": ["pos", "\n\n  So during the TOTALLY necessary lockdowns where no one was allowed to do anything being a teenage nerd I got ridiculously addicted to gaming again.  Top 1% of Warzone, nightly 5+ squad get togethers, solo stomping, all of it.Point is, in my many years of PC gaming (starting all the way back at Wolfenstein 3D) I have never been as impressed with a mouse as this one.Let me start by saying how rock solid it is.  I\u2019m one of those rage gamers.  It was worse when I was drunk.

So that said\u2026I\u2019ve purchased this mouse twice, and I gotta say\u2026. I his mouse has taken physical abuse better than any gaming peripheral I\u2019ve ever seen.  It even worked when mostly broken.When it\u2019s not broken it works fantastic as well.

They used to be top of their game.  I bought this mouse as a replacement for my old, worn out, logitech gaming mouse which had developed an issue of double clicking on a single click, or not clicking at all.  This new mouse (logitech hero), developed the same issue in less then a couple months.  I gave it a try over the next several months trying everything to fix it.  I haven't reached out to logitech yet (will be doing so asap), but I do see the logitech forums plastered with people having these same problems, with no response from Logitech.  I would highly suggest that you check out all the options from other manufactures prior to buying a new mouse.\n\n"], "76": ["pos", "\n\n  Too much.  Like trying to drive a Ferrari GT to the grocery store.  Maybe professional gamers like or need 11 mouse functions but I found some to be in the way and have had to disable half of them.

I ended up having to set the default to a keybind layout that would work on both.  The Extremely high DPI gets in the way.  In the middle of a fight my mouse is suddenly all over the place and I find the DPI has shifted up to 10,000 or 12,000.  My DPI default is set to 2400 and the DPI shift button toggles it down to 1000.Logitech makes great stuff, I have many other items.  This mouse is built well, solid and feels good.

I bought this mouse as a replacement for my M720 Triathlon, which I had used for about a year and a half before then. The issue I had with the Triathlon was that it began to double click items when I only clicked them once, and I could no longer drag and drop objects across my desktop without the mouse \"dropping\" them along the way, despite the fact that I was still holding the button.When this mouse began showing the same symptoms, I was disheartened to say the least, especially so since the mouse was out of the return window, but less than a year old. I looked into the issue deeper and found that the culprit was the Omron switches used inside the mouse, for the left and right click. A number of people had suggested switching them for Kailh GM 4.0 switches, so I decided to fix this mouse instead of buying a new one. I bought four of the Kailh switches, and I and a friend replaced the old Omrons in both my G502 Hero and my M720 Triathlon, and now they both work flawlessly.The cause of the double-click bug is due to a technical oversight in the switches longevity when in a newer, more power-conservative circuit, I was told. I found it strange, however, upon opening the mouse to replace the switches, that the DPI Up & Down buttons, as well as the side DPI Button on the G502 Hero all use Kailh switches, while the left and right still use the Omrons. This is likely due to the Omron switches having been considered the higher quality option, at the time of this mouses inception, but by that point, I am certain Logitech was already aware of the issues that switch was facing.If you can replace the switches, either by yourself or with some help, I can recommend this mouse, otherwise, expect to replace it within two years, most likely.UPDATE: 9 Months InAfter a few months since my review, it is now April, and the Hyperscroll feature of the device stopped working abruptly. I hadn't done anything to merit this, it simply quit. After dismantling the mouse (again), I found that the interior mechanism which allows switching between Hyperscrolling and traditional scrolling (which lets the scroll wheel spin freely) is a simple spring and a pin, with a plastic paddle, and a small gear system that allows the switch from one mode to another. When the paddle is engaged, it pushes the pin away from the scroll wheel, which allows the wheel to spin without clicking. When disengaged, the pin is pushed against the scroll wheel, which causes the familiar click/bump of scrolling. Pretty simple, except that whoever designed this mechanism didn't account for a few important aspects: The spring they used is about 4x too weighty for the job, and the pin is held in by... hope? I guess? there really isn't anything stopping the pin from moving side to side, and it can move too far from the paddle, meaning that when the paddle goes to make contact enough to push the pin away, it goes right by, and the scroll clicks regardless, as there's nothing to push it away from the wheel.Since the spring has way too much tension for its purpose, it does do an excellent job at one thing: pushing the pin right out of place. Two millimeters of plastic, on the edge of the paddle, to hold the pin in, would have stopped this, or making the pin go the whole way through, and adding a second mount on the other side of the wheel, to hold it in place. I can think of at least ten different ways to prevent this pin from sliding. Unlike the Omron switches, which I can forgive as a possible oversight, as the choice to use them was likely misinformed with out dated information, the issues plaguing the scroll wheel should have been addressed before the mouse even reached production, as this is an easily noticed and easily amended flaw.All of these issues have driven my rating of this device from 5 stars, to 4 stars, and now 2 stars. I give the device 2 stars because, at the end of the day, it is user serviceable, and I like Logitech. I've had good experiences with their products every single time I've bought them until now, and its very unfortunate that this is the first thing I've bought from them that has disappointed me. I cannot recommend this mouse.\n\n"], "78": ["pos", "\n\n  After 12 years, my MADCATZ mouse finally gave up the ghost, and I needed a replacement gaming mouse.  As my budget now is much more limited, and MADCATZ isn't what it used to be, I chose to go with this one based on reviews I had read online. It has performed quite well, and with my large hands, the fit is pretty good.The only issue I have had, as have others, is the middle wheel/button.  It is very easy to mis-click with it, and hit one of the side buttons when trying to click the center. I highly recommend not using the center or wheel side buttons for anything essential in the game, as in the heat of a big battle, the odds of you hitting the wrong ability are pretty high. I keep the utility abilities on the middle button.  The scroll function is good, and it's nice to be able to turn off the wheel clicker for free scrolling when I want.  However the side buttons on the wheel don't have a definite on/off click to them, and there is a sort of light clickyness as you move it side to side, almost like a two stage switch with a single function, and the angle of your finger can cause it to very easily trigger it, especially if you have used it recently for one of the side functions, and it's in the first stage. I have found that to ensure the right button is hit, that I have to stretch my finger flat over the wheel to ensure that I get a true straight down motion. Given this, as well as the placement of the other buttons, I wouldn't recommend this mouse to anyone with small hands, especially as there is no adjustment capability. With adjustment capability and a better middle button/scroll, this would be a 6 star mouse.As for the rest, it integrates perfectly into my Logitech software for my G13 as well as any other Logitech hardware I may pick up in the future, and they work well together. I have had no tracking issues, and as I use a rather large HD TV as a monitor, it was simple to adjust tracking for a comfortable fit to my large screen while still keeping fine control over game movement. I don't regret buying and using this mouse. I haven't had it very long, so I can't speak to longevity, but at this price point, I would be very surprised to get 12 years of heavy use out of it, though I do expect it to last a while, as I have had vey good experiences with Logitech hardware over the years.\n\n"], "79": ["neg", "\n\n  I bought this mouse to replace another mouse that had lasted 5 years.  This mouse was purchased because I wanted a quality product that would last.

I click and drag a lot for work, and this is unacceptable that the mouse did not even make it a year.  Very disappointed in Logitech product quality for this price range.\n\n"], "80": ["pos", "\n\n  There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!1) Daily useNot everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros: - Fits incredibly well around your hand - Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use  > Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc. - Great grip - Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software2) GamingWhen I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros: - You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better! - The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something) - The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!\n\n"], "81": ["pos", "\n\n  This mouse is awesome for gaming and office work. It is on the heavier side even without any weights inside the mouse. I have bigger hands and my hand fits comfortably. I do a ton of gaming with a side of office work with daily use and this mouse holds up for whatever task is thrown at it. The software to control everything is great, but not perfect. I like the accessibility you have with the software along with the hardware too. The RGB is a nice touch. I like that when you change your DPI you can quickly glance at the RGB lights to determine which one you're using. I have 2 complaints and that is that the 2 buttons to the side of the left-click button are easy to click on accident. It doesn't happen to me a lot, but it definitely does happen usually when I go to place my hand back on the mouse. My second complaint is that the rubber grips get dirty and it is kind of hard to clean in my opinion because of the texture it has. Great mouse overall.\n\n"], "82": ["neg", "\n\n  Love this except for one flaw that is kinda bothering me. I\u2019ve rearranged the weights several times to try to fix, to no avail.

And I\u2019ve made the sure wheel is not moving, nothing is moving. But it continues to do this day after day on at least two of my games. Also just realized (when I was on Logitech's site looking at possible ways to fix this) that the mouse is supposed to light up on the side piece as well, not just the Logitech symbol. Mine is not. So this makes me wonder now if I DO in fact have a defective product. I'll give it a go for a couple more days, but if the scrolling issue doesn't get resolved, I'll be sending it back. I did just turn on the switch to stop the wheel from free spinning, just in case that was the issue, though I'm sure it was not, as I made sure it was not spinning when the zooming/unzooming has happened. Otherwise this mouse is awesome. That\u2019s the only reason for the 3 stars. The mouse fits comfortably to my hand, feels great, and has great response times.**Update** I have sent this back. The lights on the side randomly come on. The zooming got a little better once I locked the wheel, but part of the reason for having it was the free spinning. I\u2019m going to get another one and cross my fingers**2nd Update** instead of getting another wired version, I went ahead and got the wireless. Same design and after using it for a week, I\u2019m completely in love.\n\n"], "83": ["neg", "\n\n  Overall, this would be a 4 or 5 star product out of the box, but it seems like, over time, nearly 100% of these mice eventually develop a faulty sensor for either the left or right mouse button. In simple terms, when holding down the mouse button (right, in my case) the button will electrically release and reclick, despite being physically held down with constant pressure. For some games, this may not even noticeable, but for others it can render the game unplayable. For example, you might be aiming down the scope of a rifle, when suddenly the mouse releases your aim, then looks back down the scope, and repeats this several times over a few seconds, making aiming effectively impossible.From what I've read online (could be completely wrong, I'm not an expert) the switches logitech uses are relatively cheap Chinese-made switches not ideal for operating at the low voltages this mouse outputs... What happens is the switches develop a static charge that resists voltage potential and can interrupt current flowing through the sensor. A quick fix is to lightly blow under the faulty mouse button - the moisture in your breath helps dissipate excess charge built up on the switch, and this will temporarily fix the button. Unfortunately it's a short lived fix and has diminishing returns over time - at first the problem wouldn't return for months, now I have to do this once per day. Really annoying and unfortunately the problem developed just a few days outside the 1 year warranty window, so I replaced it with a Razer Viper Ultimate and I'm much happier with it than the G502.\n\n"], "84": ["pos", "\n\n  I bought the original (non-Hero) G502 about 5 years ago and loved it.

You can't turn the RGB off but you can set it to one colour and not have it flashing. Also the DPI buttons are on the side where my thumb rests, I have no reason to change them on the fly, and would rather have the usual extra 2 buttons there instead of on the top left of the mouse.\n\n"], "87": ["pos", "\n\n  I bought this mouse to replace a very disappointing Corsair mouse of similar design that finally wore out. I can say that this mouse stands up next to the Corsair counterparts reasonably well albeit with a bit less \"flair\".I found the feel and movement to be comparable and the DPI setting ranges are equal if not a bit better in this case. There are plenty of buttons and the customizable weight was a feature that I first thought was largely useless, but actually gave me a chance to improve the feel and movement from the \"stock\" configuration.The one drawback I've found is the scroll wheel. You have two options: rock hard or complete freewheel. After using it for a few weeks I determined that the \"rock hard\" setting became tiresome when scrolling through webpages and that the freewheel setting enabled quick scrolling. However, when in freewheel, the wheel has a terrible tendency to have backlash, most likely due to the sensor design. I haven't encountered any broken switches or movements, but suspect several of the reports of \"broken wheels\" may be due either to the user not realizing the mode is toggled by the (undocumented) toggle \"button\" just below the wheel or using the \"button\" as a brake in freewheel mode, which I found will likely cause the ratcheting mechanism to bind and break.Another somewhat disappointing feature of the wheel is that the left and right scroll wheel movements are single clicks rather than repeating, which requires repeated clicking left or right to scroll instead of having a continuous movement like older Logitech mice did. I found the left-right scroll doesn't work with all programs either (Excel being one), which was also a disappointment.Another recent discovery is that, like the Corsair I had previously, recent updates to their software can cause severe system crashes, which has led me to disable updating altogether. Attempts to alert the company to this issue met with a canned response, leading me to believe they're not too concerned about the quality of their driver software, which is unfortunate.This would be a five-star mouse if the scroll wheel was improved and if we didn't have to worry about a driver software update completely breaking our systems without warning.\n\n"], "88": ["neg", "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0For the first year this mouse was truly fantastic, would have whole-heartedly given it 5 stars, however after only a single year I have encountered a problem that renders the mouse nigh unusable.After only a single year, the primary button, m1, suffers from severe stuttering and unreliable response from user inputs.It is utterly ridiculous for a mouse at this price point to suffer from a hardware flaw like this so soon, and apparently it is a common issue with many other logitech brand mice.Trying to navigate through the Logitech warranty website is a purposefully roundabout experience in order to do anything except give you a replacement under their own warranty policy.

The mouse claims to have on-board memory but NONE of the settings can be customized with it, you can only use pre-made profiles which all suck. So if you want to change DPI, Polling Rate, or any of the button functions, you need G Hub running at all times.For folks like me who like to squeeze as much performance from their machines as possible, this is unacceptable. In my task manager right now there are 6 different G Hub .exes using up a total of 246 CPU threads, and an absurd 300mb of RAM.

The issue was that the left click was no longer working as intended. I was not able to click and drag anything and would occasionally register a double click. Apparently this is a common issue, but at the price, I just couldn't find another mouse that could compete. At the price, it's reasonable, I just wish if it was such a common issue, for it to have been fixed already especially since it's one of their more popular gaming mouse. Since then, I've also purchased a MX Master 3 and use them side by side depending on my uses. It's still one of the better gaming mouse out there, especially for the price.\n\n"], "92": ["pos", "\n\n  To fully take advantage of this mouse's precision, go to the mouse settings on Windows, set it to the slowest setting, then go into the Logitech software and up the DPI. This will give you the most precise tracking you can get from the mouse. A lost of people seem to just use a lower DPI in the mouse software and wonder why with small movements, the mouse becomes jumpy. Don't be that person. Set up your software correctly.And why do you want to do it this way? Well, because the mouse has buttons with which you can slow it down or speed it back up anytime - it works in normal windows mode and in games on a hardware level and there is no adjustment needed after you set it up initially. The other way round, you would have to go into game and/or Windows settings to make those changes.PS: I also have the G900 and G903 with PowerPlay. I use the G502 HERO for my work machine I mainly use for office work and I used a cheaper mouse before that was just so annoying when trying to pull on Excel cell corners - you need the precision at that place. However, I didn't want to break the bank after spending over $200 for a wireless low latency setup on my gaming PC. This mouse has all that for less than $50 with the only limitation that it is wired. I love heavier mice and this one has weights.

From Razer to Alienware, this one competes with the best of them. The adjustable weights are also a plus. I\u2019m not hardcore on FPS so I don\u2019t use them but they can come in handy for those of you who are into shooters. The extra buttons are also a big plus. It has a couple and they can be very useful.The only downside I can think of is the mouse itself is rather a bit small for my taste and I think it could use a pinky support but I do have large hands so perhaps it isn\u2019t applicable for everyone. Also while it does have many extra buttons, the thumb one is awkwardly positioned right under the thumb so I frequently press it by mistake. The two index finger buttons next to left click are also a bit inconvenient because one would have to move the index finger off the important left click to use them.Conclusion: I got it on sale for $39.99 and for the price it\u2019s a fantastic deal. At its full price of $80 however they may be better options but either way, it is a solid product.\n\n"], "95": ["pos", "\n\n  I've always loved the Magic Mouse and can't give that up because of the multitouch features, but this mouse is so comfortable, and moves so effortlessly, I actually look forward to using it for gaming.Once I got it configured for a particular game, it's actually improved my playing because of the multi-button functionality. Moving functions to the mouse instead of trying to handle multiple actions at once on the keyboard has been a huge benefit, and has actually made the game more enjoyable to play.Nothing can replace the multi-gesture functionality of Apple's Magic Mouse surface, but this is fully in use now and I really enjoy it.It feels very solid and slides effortlessly. I have a small hand that has no trouble reaching all the buttons and features, and its response rate is fantastic.\n\n"], "96": ["pos", "\n\n  So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.Update:Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main \"Settings\" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well.\n\n"], "97": ["pos", "\n\n  So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.First is the design:The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.Second is the software:The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.Third is the delivery:It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly.\n\n"], "98": ["pos", "\n\n  This is a fantastic mouse! The buttons and even the scroll wheel are PERFECTLY clicky. If you don't like that, the scroll wheel \"click\" can be turned off with the button directly under it, so it free spins. You can also download it's user interface where you can download other users set-ups for specific games, etc. and can built your own, along with setting up the \"G\" logo color palette. The color vibrance and transition is so smooth and bright looking, I actually left it rainbow (my pics did not at all do the colors justice). The sides are rubberized, which provides excellent control for button use. The 2 thumb buttons, 1 in front of the thumb rest & 1 above, and the 2 on the left button are extremely well placed, easy to use, but do not get accidently pushed easily. The bottom is slighlt gridded for friction & the wire is covered in woven nylon & runs about 6 ft. Oh, and it comes with a 5 pack of weights in their own case.

Way better/more customization option, buttons clicks really good and overall build quality is awesome despite the cost of this mouse just being 40$!Little plastic container contains multiple weights to weigh down your mouse is a surprise for me. Those thing fits under discretely.Now, there's one issue that has been really bothering me is the placement of G7 and G8 buttons mainly meant for upping and lowering DPI sensitivity into however many DPI stages you've added in G-Hub. Placement sucks. Left click is narrow and I can easily hit G7 and lowers my DPI sensitivity making me die, a lot while playing FPS such as Halo Infinite or while browsing through the internet I accidentally lower my DPI when I just want to casually browse. If it was placed differently or had stiffer click to prevent accidents, then I wouldn't have any issues. \"But you can turn them off!\" Everyone has a different playing style and customization, I personally need them to adjust for whatever games I play so I keep accidentally lowering my sensitivity mid-game, it just ruins the moment.Other than that issue, overall mouse is really good. Like, actually good.\n\n"], "100": ["neg", "\n\n  The weights are good but standard.  The resolution as expected.  Button presses require very little force (I would bet the switches would be the first things to fail).Update few months later: docked two stars, left button has developed switch bounce and now sometimes clicks multiple times with one press of the button.Update months laterer: Oh man, you're gonna love this.  Button got worse (couldn't even drag anything; real fun playing the \"which folder did the file get dropped into?\" game) then the right button started to display similar issues.  Logitech did send me a new one, buuuuuut....It took me a month or two to actually get the warranty process started and it's a huge hassle.  Even once the warranty process starts and someone actually contacts you, it's only to give you a many-steps email to get you to do the troubleshooting for them (including removing their own software which makes sense as it's basically malware; it's bad).They make you, no joke, record a video of you clicking on a website they send you to with:- the mouse visible,- the website url visible,- the \"double click counter\" visible, AND- a HANDWRITTEN NOTE with the ticket number written on it.If you can jump through all those flaming hoops and prove that, indeed, the issue you said it had (months ago) was really real they're going to have you then take a picture with:- the mouse visible,- the S/N visible (and it has to be the one on the product, not the box), AND- ... ANOTHER handwritten note with the S/N and the ticket number written on it.I'll be honest, I expected them to next request I take a picture of myself holding the mouse with the ticket number scratched into my forehead while holding a newspaper like some sort of kidnapping victim.  They didn't ask for that, however; instead, they asked for all of my details and sent me a new one.So, in summary:- they replaced defective product and I love being able to drag files or select text again, that's one (1) shiny gold star for Logitech added!- they made the process so painful I'd rather have a cage-match with a gang of feral cats all hopped up on catnip and PCP than go through it again, TWO STAR: MINUS  >:-[If yours develops any issue at all during Amazon return/replace period, do it before that time runs out.Interestingly, they don't even seem to want the mouse with the bad switch back, which would be an easy/cheap fix. I thought they made me go through all that 'cause they're so expensive to make or something, heck they already spent a lot of money on labor hours, but... nope.  That's right, the expensive (well... more than $10) mouse they want you to perform 3 miracles to replace isn't worth shipping that tiny box over.\n\n"], "101": ["pos", "\n\n  Generally, you hear a lot of good things about Logitech mice, but this one might possibly be the best one from them.

Unhinge that bad boy, blare some eurobeat, and rip your finger off of the wheel.The wheel itself is comfortable, and really sturdy when you're clicking, or even scrolling. The other buttons don't get in the way of your clicks, and the wheel lock is completely out of the way when you're using it.The only (probably personal) issue I have so far is, my mouse does glitch out, and moves either in one direction, or spasms. I don't have any dust, nor debris on my mouth, so I'm unsure if I have a faulty mouse, or it could be one of those model-specific issues.Regardless of that, this is a really nice mouse for its price.

Both are having typical left click failures, so I wanted something heavy with a larger footprint like the M65.Logitech got a lot right with this design, which is why I'm not surprised it hasn't changed much over the years. The ability to add weights is a huge plus for me since I love a large, heavy mouse for some weird reason. The magnetic flap is one of my favorite design choices as well - it's dead simple and honestly really cool.The scroll wheel is solid and tactile, and provides a rewarding click when using. With the scroll button disengaged, the scroll wheel is buttery smoooooth. I definitely dig it, especially because this mouse pulls double-duty between my gaming PC and my work laptop.Honestly, the only issue I've found is that DPI switches positioned essentially on the left click (G7 and G8) can prove to be an annoyance if you miss the click and unintentionally increase/decrease the DPI.  I think this issue is mainly on me, though. I change up my grips periodically, so it's really just acclimatizing to the mouse at this point.Overall, I really dig the G502.

Two issues immediately stood out.First, my ring finger has a place to rest on the right edge of the G403, while this mouse doesn't quite have room for it, so I'd need to modify my grip to either squeeze it on with my middle finger, or drop it over the side.  It probably wouldn't be a huge deal in the long run, but I noticed the difference in ergonomics right away.Second, and the reason I chose to immediately return the mouse and order another G403 (a HERO this time, because that's what's available) is the scrollwheel.  The G502 scrollwheel has a slick metal surface that's almost slippery, and a LOUD clicking in step-mode.  The button for switching to smooth scrolling is a nice feature, but in step mode it's just too clunky.  By contrast, the G403 has a rubberized wheel surface that requires very little force to use and light detents that silently provide just the right amount of feedback for stepped scrolling without adding appreciable resistance.\n\n"], "106": ["neg", "\n\n  I had an iBuyPower mouse that lasted me six years I got for $11 at a thrift store. This g502 Logitech Hero hasn't even lasted me two years. I was waiting to review this for this purpose. I'm now back to using the thrift store mouse because the g502 Hero is no longer functioning.The upside: The mouse feels nice and glides effortlessly across most surfaces. It is comfortable.Primary Issues: Comfort is about all this piece of junk has going for it. Left click doesn't double click all the time, and actually stopped \"clicking\" a few months into use so now I just have to guess since there is no audible click or touch-sensory click. The right click doesn't work at all most of the time and that's important for some games and functions I use on my computer, so I have to use my other mouse entirely for that purpose.Glider Wheel broke several months in. I was able to fix it by cleaning it out the first time, thinking it was just general build up or something, but the second time the button which allows you to utilize the smooth wheel versus the click wheel went out, and any time I try to up-scroll it doesn't register as a scroll and instead registers as me clicking the wheel.Again, the right click stopped working. It still clicks, I can feel it, I can hear it, but the mouse doesn't react. I disassembled, cleaned, reassembled and still nothing.Unreliable DPI stability feature. Sometimes my DPI will drop well below acceptable usability, then recover on its own.The entire software setup, this gHub or whatever, is absolute garbage. Completely. Ridiculous. Trash. It is a convoluted mess requiring so much more work than is necessary to use. It crashes for no reason despite updates, does not save profiles, does not let you utilize macros, is not user friendly, and requires manual startup. If you click to open it, it just sits on the \"Update\" screen indefinitely.There are too many other things I want to say about this product, but overall, and being a lifelong fan of Logitech, I'm more than disappointed. This is the second g502 Hero I've bought (the one I bought from Amazon was New/Unused) and to be quite honest I'd rather go through another company than deal with these issues anymore.

I really wanted a mouse with extra buttons directly adjacent to the M1 or M2 button like the g300s had and this one has two next to the M1 button and a couple of thumb buttons.Weight: Medium to heavy depending on weights added. There is a hinged magnetic \"door\" on the bottom of the mouse that makes it extremely easy to adjust the weight of the mouse on a whim. My g300s was ultra lightweight, which made flick shots extremely easy but glidey tracking wasn't perfectly smooth. This one glides extremely well and flicks well with the weights taken out. Adding too much weight can cause overshoot or a kind of rubber banding effect when I throw my hand quickly, but more weight feels like it has easier gliding and tracking.Features: This has things like profile shifting and a temporary dpi shift \"sniper\" button but I never use those. It does have a scroll wheel lock and unlock button that lets you choose between the clicky single line scrolling or the friction free high speed scrolling, which I change all the time as needed. Usually for browsing.Software: Let's you change your lights, button assignments, make macros, etc. The usual.Cons: The only minor con is that the scroll wheel very slightly jiggles when flicking the mouse quickly. It has never caused me problems, but I can feel it when it happens. I fixed it by using a thin nylon washer with a slit cut in it so I could lower it on the \"axle\" the scroll wheel is attached to.

I felt my ability to pick precise targets in shooting scenarios would be enhanced compared to my old Microsoft mouse.-The ability to switch the scroll button to free-wheeling is handy and satisfying.-Materials do seem to be nice and solid.-The weights are a nice touch for customizability.-The lights add visual appeal without being too flashy.  Colors are customizeable.-The quantity of buttons available is good, and their locations are easily accessible by fingers without accidental touches just from gripping the mouse itself.-The sliding surfaces on the bottom are smooth and large.-The feel in my larger than average hands was nice.  Ergonomics were good compared to a more standard shape.-The thumb button for engaging low DPI would be good if I could get used to it.-The multiple profiles available for single or multiple customized DPI & programmed button settings is nice.Cons:-There's too much resistance on the scroll wheel when free-wheeling is disengaged.  When my fingers were dry, they would actually slip on the metal wheel surface instead of rolling it.-The left/right bump buttons on the scroll wheel are easy to press, but the center scroll button is hard to press.  I found it very difficult to consistently press only the center scroll button.  Most of the time I was accidentally pressing down and left or right at the same time.-My habit of wedging my thumb against the mouse pad and mouse for extra precision is not possible with this mouse due to the ergonomic wing shape on the left side.  I found this highly annoying, and it made it harder for me to hit targets.

CLICKCLICK! CLICK.MORE NEGATIVES:The Mouse Wheel has to be some cruel experiment in psychological warfare.The Lock/Unlock implementation warrants detailed comment in both states.Beyond the fact that it is an unwanted feature at the best of times -- when gaming, it will actively hinder your enjoyment and performance -- unless you dedicate your life mastering it, and I have no intention of doing anything remotely close to that.* As a free spinning wheel, it fails due to floatiness.Unless you just want to rip-scroll through several pages of product reviews on Amazon to record for a video project, it has no use case that is superior to any other scrolling function available to users, and that includes the Middle Mouse Button scrolling that the mouse still possesses (I'll get to MMB issues later).* As a tick wheel, it FAILS because the ratchet is far too loose to be trusted.You get this awful effect where physically, the wheel will \"back rock\" or fore rock\" to cradle itself between the teeth.This then causes your scroll selection to tick up or down onto something other than your intent.Not always, mind you.But enough (and unpredictably so) to seriously impede, if not, ruin whatever gaming moment you might have been having.Further exacerbating the issue is you cannot change the internal DPI of the mouse wheel sensor.Not with your OS, not with G HUB, not with ANYTHING...You can only change how your Operating System MULTIPLIES the Wheel Motion.And even with a 1:1 multiple, you get that selection rocking issue.And anything LESS than 1:1 results in no scrolling whatsoever unless you unlock and rip-scroll.MOAR NEGATIVES:Oh and this is all before the issues of trying to get a clean Click out of the Middle Mouse Button buried under this infernal, Chroenburgian assembly.It feels like trying to command a Two year old into behaving, using only soft verbal warnings, while sliding supine across a frozen lake, while also being used as hockey puck by competing teams of various drunken Canadian bears and moosen.This would be an absolutely great mouse to lend to your competition.if this was the design intent, hat's off to ya.But, to put everything I've said even more viscerally...I want to rip the wheel out of the mouse with my teeth and grind it until my gums bleed.It's rare that I'm passionate at all about a design feature.But this wheel, I HATE IT.I want the person who designed it to feel as bad about making it, as I do trying to use it.NEVER REVISIT THIS DESIGN EVER AGAIN.You just don't get it.It literally adds a layer of anxiety and distrust to EVERY SINGLE THING done with this mouse.Even the tasks that have nothing to do with scrolling at all.The fact that you know this boobytrap is a centimeter from your finger is all it takes.Oh yeah. AND IT'S LOUD!It doesn't even have the common courtesy to make a satisfying noise.NO!Shifting a from 4th Gear to Reverse at Highway speed in your uncle's rustbucket Camaro is less audibly jarring!POSITIVES:The software is actually fairly good.With the caveat that you cannot change the Wheel DPI nor the Wheel Up/Down command assignments (wth?).The Motion is spot on, but that's baseline expectation for a +$50 MouseAnd the Weight system is a fine option, even if I'm most comfortable taking all the wrights AND THE DOOR off.CONCLUSION:The G502, in my humble opinion (at least THIS one I personally received) may as well be eWaste.I genuinely tried \"Getting Used to It\".I gave the thing several months.But as a result, I can no longer return it.Seriously, Logitech.If you would just use the G502's Software, Motion Sensor and Moulded Plastic Quality for the next iteration of the G300s series: I'd buy that day one.Give the next G300s a SOLID wheel with a strong ratchet and Side-Pivot lateral scrolling.You could even toss in a Thumb Toggle/Switch for DPI shifting or whatever.All these things have mechanically solid examples in your other products.Paint the dang thing Gold, charge $80, and call it the \"G399gg Great Golden Calf Edition\".I don't care.Just stop with these ridiculously over-designed \"srz gam3r\" fad features.YOU. ARE. NOT. RAZER.YOU. SHOULD. BE. BETTER. THAN. RAZER.PS. I purchased this mouse via a recommendation from a friend.Whom (upon finding out only too late) never uses the mouse wheel, extra buttons or G HUB.So yeah, 5-Stars if you just want an overpriced 2-button Mouse.\n\n"], "116": ["pos", "\n\n  Good well made mouse.Packaging and shipping was excellent.I had to give this mouse away though because it is just too large and uncomfortable for my hand size. I also would prefer more buttons.Size :I found the back of my hands hurting after using the mouse.The \"hump\" or curve of the mouse seems high, making it a reach for the far left side button (default aim). This means I likely would not use it, bringing the amount of extra buttons down (at least for me). Although, my fingers did seem to automatically find the perfectly located middle back button. I never once hit the front middle accidentally.Perhaps because one button was too far and just the sheer size of the mouse, i did find that my fingers would sort of expect the four left buttons to be far as well, causing me reach further then they actually were and mis-press.To be clear, those four and the middle back buttons are perfectly located so this is just me.Buttons:The amount they state does not include the middle front button which serves as the switch for your scroll wheel (either free rolling or click... both are great!). While I like the option to choose this, I world have prefered having another mappable middle button like my current device.Two of the mappable buttons are your scroll wheel left and right tilt.This is cool but I felt it would have been better with more noticeable feedback like a soft click. The wheel felt almost loose and I am curious if I would have ended up mistakenly clicking to the left or right while trying to just middle click.I honestly think I wouldnt and it's just a matter of the user to get used to it.Overall, a cool looking and good quality mouse with a few expertly placed buttons. Just a bit too large and would have liked more buttons since one of them becomes semi unreachable.\n\n"], "117": ["neg", "\n\n  **Updated review**Amazon replaced the mouse because Logitech was being difficult about honoring their warranty.So the 2nd mouse had the same software issue as the original review but I had found a work around for the custom key assignments by using registry edits to let the mouse work with the older software.Unfortunately this 2nd mouse has now developed the double click problem that many Logitech mice are prone to because they use cheap micro switches for the clicking mechanism.Honestly I'm just going to switch to a different brand that uses better switches even though I've been using Logitech mice for over 20 years.**Original review**I upgraded from an old G502 spectrum to this mouse.FIrst of all the good things, it's of good quality construction and fits extremely well in my hand.  It slides fairly smoothly over my mouse pad and overall it's a pleasure to use.The bad?It is not compatible with Logitech Gaming Software and instead needs to be used with G-HUB in order to customize it's settings.G-HUB is.. not so good.G-HUB prevents the left/right wheel click from continuous horizontal scrolling like I could with the G502 Spectrum on LGS.  (not to be confused with the vertical scroll wheel)I can't assign custom key assignments to the mouse while using onboard-memory mode, it only works when onboard-memory is not turned on.You can create a custom profile and then assign it to one of the 5 memory slots, but custom key assignments are for some reason not saved and/or applied.What's the point of allowing 5 custom on-the-fly profiles to be assigned if they are not going to let you use custom key assignments?It's one of the main features if the mouse that simply won't work because G-HUB doesn't work properly.Logitech should enable compatibility with LGS or fix G-HUB.Honestly I wish I could just get my money back.\n\n"], "118": ["neg", "\n\n  Here's the bottom line for this mouse. It's got average ergonomics, above average buttons and placement, but is spoiled by the terrible Logitech GHub software.This mouse doesn't have any onboard memory, which means the Logitech software *has* to be running at all times for you to use anything but the basic functions. If it closes on you (which... it will), you immediately lose any functions you've set on those extra keys until you reopen the software. I use this mouse on both my Mac and PC. The interface is poorly designed, and I've yet to have it detect different games when they run on my PC. The Mac software has even reset itself a couple times in the 3 weeks I've had it, meaning I have to go back and remap everything, reset the mouse speed, etc. Also beware, Little Snitch shows that the G Hub software does phone home to Logitech. You can't be sure what it's sending back and forth, especially when you're required to give it full access to your machine for it to function.To cap it off, Logitech has *specifically* designed the extra buttons on this mouse so that they cannot be detected by any software other than G Hub. Typically you could use an alternative like USB Overdrive or Steermouse on Mac to map buttons, but that's not an option. To be clear, that is a deliberate design choice by Logitech to lock you in to their awful software.I'd strongly recommend looking elsewhere for a mouse.\n\n"], "119": ["pos", "\n\n  I got this mouse to replace my Razor Naga and my Predator(buttons quit working) for FPS.My favorite aspect of the mouse is the adjustable weight. i like my mouse to be heavier and i was pleasantly surprised that it came with quite a bit of weight i could add to it and make it the perfect weight. The RGB lighting customization for the mouse is great and the software is super easy to use and that's where you can set your custom DPI and use the button on the mouse to quickly switch between the settings.The one thing I don't like about the mouse that I've gotten used to is the size, my hand dwarfs this mouse. Don't get me wrong its a decent size mouse but i have rather large hands so it was an adjustment but now after about 2 months of using it it feels natural and works great.I would recommend this mouse to someone who is looking for a good FPS mouse that wont break the bank.Fast forward 9 months the thing quit working.

Whether I come to regret this remains to be seen. That said, I purchased the protection plan since everything I have heard about this mouse lead me to believe that it will fail within a few years.Design flaws/QC defects aside, I really like this mouse so far. It has a bunch of features not present on other mice, like the infinite scroll wheel, left and right scroll buttons on the scroll wheel, programmable profiles, and the button to temporarily change between DPI settings within a profile when held. I'm not terribly keen on the shape of the mouse, but I'm getting used to it.I don't like the nylon braiding on the wire. I liked the cloth braided wires on older mice better. Yes, they were prone to kinking over time, but that's just my personal preference in the end.The customization software is fairly simple, but some features are easier to adjust than others. No documentation on the software in the included instructions, but it's easy to figure out how to use it given a bit of time.If it wasn't for the double clicking issues plaguing these mice I would say this is a solid 4.5-5 star product, but knowing how widespread they are I'm giving this a 4 star rating instead.

I can't tell if I got an especially loud one, or if other people just don't notice the noise, or what, because every time I use the scroll wheel it's SO loud that I'm debating whether to keep using this mouse or not. Hoping it'll get quieter over time because it really is a great mouse otherwise! Just so, so, so very loud.(You can switch between regular scroll and hyper scroll, and hyper scroll is totally silent, but it's also far too imprecise for me to use for most things.

I don't even use this for gaming really so the durability is questionable.I love the G602 and, besides the wireless version of the G502, the G502 wired is the closest thing to the G602. The mouse clicks feel nice and sound quiet just like the G602. The build quality is great and it doesn't feel cheap. However, my biggest complaint about this mouse is that it does not have the same amount programmable buttons the G602 had.

This mouse is better for claw grips. It's a cool mouse, but not for me.

I thought the Hero 502 felt narrow. Hero 502 measures ~60mm across as the gripping area, but so does the Death Adder. I think the problem is attributed to to the narrow tapering base where your palm sits.On the 502 Hero, there is only about ~60mm in diameter at the base, but it's tapered so much near the top, there is almost nowhere for your palm to sit on. (I like my palm grip when I'm aiming with my arm.).In Comparison with the Death Adder at around ~73cm in diameter, my palm sits comfortably. I've had a couple Razer products and I want to go try other things now. The current DE Chroma, somethings are wearing off/out. So it's time for a new mouse.Nitpicks: The scroll wheel is more like a flywheel. I don't want that much momentum when I flick that wheel around. I do like the idea of tilting the wheel, cool feature.Another nitpick is Ghub, I'm not familiar with it, but it did take a while for me to set up the DPI. And man that was down a couple of rabbit holes. I didn't realize GHUB had profiles for each game you had (Which can be a cool thing, but I was hoping the Desktop default was the global set for everything unless you manually change a profile for a game.Last nitpick about GHUB, if you have a library of games, you have to keep clicking over this long horizontal list of icons. Come on, why can't we set these to tiles of some sort? Or just a line by line list of games?

For editing, I use a lot of Ctrl functions like Ctrl C, CtrlV, CtrlZ, and CtrlS, so making them each one click streamlines things a great deal.CONS- Software is very glitchy and bloated. Takes up a lot of memory just to assign a few buttons. Sometimes the button assigns just reset to factory after a while. Had to reinstall it.-The mouse wheel is one of those free-spinning ones that you can either spin like a fidget spinner or lock into a more traditional motion.

I'm so tired of Logitech and how cheap their mice are built. It's a crying shame too because I think the mouse is great for gaming, but that stupid double click issue is not being resolved. This will probably be the last Logitech Gaming mouse I buy until they do a better job with making them and fixing the double-clicking issue.\n\n"], "128": ["pos", "\n\n  Scroll: 5/10Noise (lack of): 7/10Ease of click: 6/10Speed: 10/10Price/value: 6/10Comfort: 10/10Overall, I would call this an average mouse. It's fast, it's comfortable, and it looks nice. Only problems? Well, there's quite a few.The scroll wheel has two settings: free scroll and resistance scroll. The free wheel, while quiet, is annoying as all heck - while a great idea, it just doesn't work practically when in a game or document. As soon as you let it fly, it literally flies - to Neverland. I returned it for a mouse that eventually stops scrolling. lol The mechanical resistance scroll is really loud and difficult to move. So you basically choose between an uncontrollable infinite scroll or a \"stuck\" mouse wheel. There is no in-between.This mouse isn't advertised as \"noiseless,\" so I'll be a little easier on it. But it's so loud. So damn loud. I wanted a mouse that was quieter than my last one, but this one was louder.While this mouse has great DPI, it's hard to click and therefore reduces your time to react. Would not recommend for an FPS. I tried it in Destiny 2, and the thing just was ridiculously slow. You basically have to whack it to get it to shoot.However, it's a very comfortable mouse. The design is high quality and very well made. For all its faults, though, I wouldn't pay even the sale price I got it at ($46), much less the regular price ($79). Average mouse, not worth the price.\n\n"], "129": ["pos", "\n\n  This is the second time I've bought this exact mouse. My first one lasted about five years, so there's definitely something to be said for durability. They don't have a crap ton of buttons like the Razer Naga, but I prefer it that way (it has seven buttons, not including the right/left and wheel). This mouse is insanely ergonomic and feels like it was made for my hand. The removable weights are very nice, too (I prefer all of them to be in). It has a very satisfying click and the wheel can either be smooth or lightly clicky. You can also adjust your pointer speed directly on the mouse, which I adore! The cord is long and has a fabric covering. There's a wireless version, but those irritate me. It also moves very smoothly on the mousepad and works great with super fast pointer speed. Very customizable in the Logitech app, as well.\n\n"], "130": ["pos", "\n\n  The shape and feel of the mouse is nice, and comfortable for people with larger hands. The custom button placements are better than the older models and easier to hit. The one issue I have is why did you make the scroller button out of Teflon? It's seriously the slipperiest roller on any mouse I've ever used; the last one had a nice rubber strip around it. Hopefully as it wears it will lose some of this but I may have to disassemble it and buff it up a bit so I can roll it without accidentally clicking all the time. You can turn off the clicker so that it's a smooth scroll but that's very sensitive to backwards scrolls so is hard to use in normal situations like web browsing, etc.\n\n"], "131": ["pos", "\n\n  Got this mouse because I can palm a basketball so the 305 felt like a child's toy in my hand.

To me, this is fine as I need something heavier or my movements would be uncontrollable.Sensor, settings and rbg are all perfect, G-Hub is a great program and lets you set different profiles for each game.If you are a bigger or stronger person then I think the weight of the mouse will be fine for you, smaller people might want to look for the ultralights or the 305 series.I got this mouse on sale for about $27, I would not pay the full price because you can often find it on sale and at full price I think the g-pro is a better choice.\n\n"], "132": ["pos", "\n\n  I mainly play FPS games and wanted a mouse for the extra buttons that would be advantageous in the heat of the moment.

Like the software that i needed to download, very unintuitive, i am in the process of having to open the app everytime i want to game.

Cable seems to be high quality, With the adjustable DPS and colors, it's fairly customizable as well... Some may not like this feature, but when you change your profile to switch the DPS it pops up as an alert, I'm sure it's something you can disable as well, but it tells you the current DPS setting, so its faster than looking at the LEDs on the mouse for reference.

Logitech typically makes a pretty solid product without getting ridiculous.

I bought this as a lightning deal for $39. So, 40 bucks is a fair price point for this mouse - a separate software download from the internet makes it completely customizable to your liking. This is both a pro and con b/c 1) I hate bloatware from an internet download and 2) I can spend hours setting it up when I'd rather be gaming. The weights that come with it are nice quality.The regular price is somewhere around $60-$70... I'd say forget that!

In the first thirty minutes, having to install g hub and configuring the mouse seemed to be a pain in the rear considering that options and changes I've made weren't functioning correctly and did not fully implement itself into the mouse. Cases of this were changing the functionality of some buttons on the mouse as provided by the software (g hub) and the dpi of the mouse.

Either case this should not be an issue when spending $80 on a advertised high quality mouse. Honestly disappointing.

Gold Standard.\n\n"], "140": ["pos", "\n\n  I read through some of the user reviews and watched some video reviews on this before I purchased.  I've owned many Logitech high-end gaming mice (and general Logitech mice) in the past.  When my G700S of old was having double-click issues, I bought a Roccat Nyth.  The bigger and wider nature of the mouse took a little getting used to (with the wide right-side grip on).  I fell in love with the width and generally larger size to fit my larger hands.  However, it has built up its share of dirt and grime in rather hard to reach places in the years I've owned it.  The interchangeable and customizable thumb buttons are a very nice feature, except for the fact that the blank covers wobble detracting from the otherwise solid feel of the mouse.I figured I'd give Logitech another try bearing in mind the biggest nagging drawback to my old G700S was the wobbly and loud scroll wheel.  My Nyth has a tactile bumpy scroll wheel that have grown to love a lot and its quiet.  The G502 Hero's is not quiet and it is still wobbly, just like my old G700S of old.  In fact the only Logitech gaming mouse from past experience that didn't have a wobbly scroll wheel was the G7.  The scroll wheel on the Hero is not only wobbly, but the tactile actuation force difference between left tilt and right tilt is significant.  In that right tilt is so easy to accidentally hit whereas left tilt requires quite a bit more force to actuate.  This scroll wheel feel has been mostly the same throughout the various mice Logitech has made that have featured a hyperscroll wheel (you click a switch to switch between smooth scrolling and notched scrolling).  I guess in the intervening 3 years since I've owned a Logitech gaming mouse, this has not changed.  Their mouse wheel is still the same wobbly protrusion.Sadly, the scroll wheel tactility and overall polish (or lack thereof) is enough for me to decide to return it after only just picking this up from the Amazon locker only an hour ago.  Well that and the lack of any additional grips, though I won't hold the grip against it.  The Nyth's interchangeable grips are featured in very few mice.For the $75 that this mouse was, I feel the mouse wheel could have been improved considering that they've had this mouse wheel hyperscroll feature for nearly 10 years now...Going to give the Roccat Leadr a try considering how much i like my Nyth.  If only the Nyth came in a wireless variant with more solid (less wobbly thumb buttons and covers/spacers).TLDR: -2 stars for wobbling scroll wheel.  Right tilt too easy to trigger.  Wheel scrolling in notched mode is very loud, as loud as my Kaihl brown keyboard switches.\n\n"], "141": ["pos", "\n\n  Pros:- Onboard memory (can pretty much carry my settings over to my work PC)- Customizable DPI, lighting, and buttons- Multiple profiles (configs you can cycle through)- Spinning scroll wheel with toggle button- Easily accessible DPI switch on the side (great for FPS games)Cons:- Noticeably small if you have large hands. If you're wondering, it is smaller than the Logitech MX mice (which I like for their size). My measurements (finger tip to palm x palm including thumb): 7\" x 4\"- G-Hub: I could rant about this but I'll keep it brief. Although I haven't had any of the horrible experiences I've had in the past with using G-Hub for their headsets where the drivers and G-Hub itself would break with every update, however you absolutely need it to use %100 of the mouse features. G-Hub has a subreddit if you want to get an idea of how many products experience breakage with each update (automatic updates can be disabled though).- Spin wheel toggle is kind of hard to click into place compared to the MX mice.- Buttons feel kind of cheap.\n\n"], "142": ["pos", "\n\n  When I first had seen this mouse - and the special edition version which is uglier and $15 cheaper right now - I thought it looked extra and ridiculous between the multicolor LED and the weird design and the thumb-rest wing type thing on the side. I literally ONLY bought this because the multi-tilt scroll-wheel on my G500S was broken and the mouse was 3 years old so I believe out of warranty. That said, it's been smooth as butter from the beginning. It does require a newer version of the LGS than older peripherals did, but installing it didn't mess up my G933 or G810 profiles at all - something you should expect but these days you can't. The mouse has good weight without the custom weights - which like all Logitech gaming mice come in their own separate case and can be mixed and matched. Unlike the MX517, G500, and other previous lines, there is no weight tray - it's built in to the bottom of the mouse. Just life the panel on the bottom. I personally am not using them. This unit definitely has the precision, out of the box, for Photoshop work as well. Gaming I honestly haven't noticed a huge improvement but it has stayed the same, and that's all I needed. The scroll wheel has the same two modes as the G500 - theres a loud clicky mode with more traction, and a quiet smoother mode for faster scrolling. As with other Logitech gaming products, you can turn the LED off completely, or sync it with the LEDs from your other devices.

Other games won't be hindered by the weight. The base weight cover has a black lip unlike the Proteus's teal lip, but you can use the base cover from the Proteus  on the Hero, transferring that blue aesthetic. So you can make this look nearly identical to the Proteus. I didn't think I'd care for the RGB as It tends to be dimmer than static lighting and I only want blue, but turns out I can make a better blue from it.

For anyone who enjoys gaming, they can probably infer that this is a horrible issue. For example, if you're using a grappling hook that requires one click, and you're high up risking fall damage... Guess what. Your grapple hook just went out because your mouse registered two clicks instead of one, and now the cooldown is causing you to fall to your death. This isn't an uncommon issue either, and logitech is very well; however, their upper management has put policies in place to make it unreasonably prohibitive to acquire a replacement mouse. By the time I was done sending in all of the screenshots of click-register testing, pictures of the mouse and serial numbers, I gave up because I had other things going on in my life to the point where I'd probably pay $40 just to tell Logitech to shove the mouse up a place where no light can be shone.From what the Logitech rep told me, the switch issue that is present (and has been present for 1-2+ years) is prevalent in many mouse manufacturers.

I was looking for something that felt nice and I could stand it breaking in the next two years. This feels nice. The weight adjustment is a nice feature, and the handful of programmable buttons is great. I use various macros or prefer to have some oft-used keys on in reach of my thumb quite a bit. The G Hub software is easy to use, so getting all set up the way I wanted took less than 20 minutes.After I read another review after thinking the scroll wheel just sucked, I was very satisfied. I initially thought there was no tactile feedback to the wheel, but there was a button for it! It must have come in one position, or I accidentally hit it, but once I clicked it everything felt great.

The RGB LEDs are not all that impressive because only two parts of the mouse light up. Most of the buttons are easily accessible without much finger travel though they really missed an opportunity to put buttons on the right side for increased ergonomics. The plastic and rubber feel cheap in the palm and what disappoints me the most is the use of rubber in parts of the mouse because the oils on your hand will eventually degrade it (this happened to my other logitech mouse.) Another quirk: this mouse is strongly magnetic at the bottom which causes it to stick somewhat to my stainless steel desk. This isn't a deal breaker for me because now I don't need to use the weights for added resistance but its still not something you'd expect.Negatives aside the mouse works as expected but for the overall build quality I would say it needs to be set at a lower price.\n\n"], "148": ["neg", "\n\n  As a Logitech User I was already satisfied with the G502 Proteus Core though of course over the years the wiring's mesh has frayed so I thought to get a new one and seeing the Hero as only a minor upgrade at a fair price than my original purchase I proceeded to grab it.It feels great, nostalgic for Proteus Core users and of course with the extra DPI range can make gaming rather engaging albeit a little bit.For the time being, I enjoy it and would be open to see what else Logitech would do to top it off.UPDATE: So a notable error has occurred that I felt should be brought up to which I have not found a \"reliable\" solution to yet. In short, over the past couple months I've noticed an odd increase in input from the mouse (sudden multi-clicks) when I was playing Osu! (Rhythm Game I occasionally play) as the ripple indicator as well my Mouse Key Input Tab was registering more hits than usual, even when Click+Dragging for the game.Before this, I was having some similar issues while playing games on my emulator where my click and drag would reset and interrupt the gameplay. The notable bit is the pressure put on the mouse whether it be lightly pressed or firmly pressed and even after testing the hardware with a click test it now registers that every 10/100 Clicks a double input would occur if pressed lightly though when \"mashing\" the results increase (20-24/100 Clicks) which has me puzzled at what needed to be done.Overall, the mouse is \"usable\" though for high intensity applications that require precision and such I would not recommend grabbing this mouse as its lifespan was barely over a year and not at all satisfactory for the consumer.UPDATE: So I attempted to rectify the issue again though after some more time had passed, there is a notable hardware issue with this mouse where your \"left\" clicks registers multiple times with it's sensitive clicking which is a hinderance to \"active\" games like Osu! which require precise clicks and dragging at high speeds. Even playing on emulators is stifling to do where you have to resort to registering your main clicks with the \"right\" button instead of the usual left button.

I needed a replacement for my old G402, the left button switch was randomly double clicking on single press. The 402 lasted me a few years and I was sad to see it go.Just like the 402, the 502 Hero is good for people with larger hands. It's slightly smaller as you can see in my pics, but hardly noticeable. The buttons schemes are almost identical which made the transition to the 502 seamless. The shape of the mouse is comfortable and easy to get used to. The thumbrest is large which may take up some real estate, so beware of you have limited space.One thing I'm a little apprehensive about is the scroll wheel. It rattles around and seems to shake the entire mouse when scrolling in regular mode, not hyperfast mode (free spin). Also the left and right wheel tilt buttons have too much play. This may or may not be a problem in the future but I didn't take a star away because it's only slightly annoying. I'll update if it gets worse.The feet seem good it glides across my mousepad with ease. There is slightly more friction than my old 402, but that may just be because it's not broken in yet.All in all it seems like a good buy, but if you get it on sale then it's almost a MUST buy. There are enough features for the hard core gamer and it's easy and comfortable enough to use for the average gamer.\n\n"], "150": ["neg", "\n\n  Be aware that the double click issue may not be the hardware, other words the internal micro switch.

So, what I do is use the G Hub for button assignments making sure the setting are saved in the on board (mouse) memory, and immediately uninstall G Hub.

Also the scroll wheel on free mode is unusable, and on click mode is very clunky and inaccurate.

The problem was with the G502 Hero mouse that suddenly died after I unplugged it the first time to try another port. It never turned on again and remained disconnected.

The bad: the mouse buttons take almost no effort to click - maybe half the effort compared to G602, so I end up clicking both buttons instead of one pretty often.  Also, although I like being able to switch between the clicky and smooth motion of the wheel, the clicky mode is too loud, much louder than G602.  Finally, the back / forward side buttons are hard for me to tell apart by touch, and I have to shift the hand to reach the back one, which is not great as I use them in games.

So i bought the G502.  It is fantastik.  It is very responsive.  I liked the 4 button layout on the G700 on the left side . That was my one reservation versus really only 3 on the G502.  I love the left thumb button on the G502 which the G700 did not have.  I do not know why they could not have kept the 4 buttons on the G700 and just added the thumb button on the G502.

It has good set of features and I liked the overall design, however after a couple of months I began to have problems with intermittent operation of the right mouse button. At times, when I held down the button it would send random click up and down events. If I pressed harder they would often stop so it was obvious that the switch was malfunctioning. I contacted Logitech and after troubleshooting the problem they sent me a replacement mouse. Over the last couple of weeks the replacement has begun to exhibit the same problem. A quick internet search reveals that this seems to have been a common problem with this model since its release which Logitech has not fixed despite a large number of complaints..

Tracking seems accurate.Meh:  It's narrow, not great if you have larger hands (fine if not).  Weight is almost too much, even without the (seemingly) unnecessary extra weights (included) that you can install.  The 'thumb rest' (for right handed people anyway) is weird, though I think with more use it will be fine, maybe even a nice plus.Misses:  The mouse wheel.  It almost feels like an afterthought.  It's a solid plastic piece, with larger dips that probably double as grip texture and the mechanism to create the stops or 'speed bumps' when you scroll the wheel.  It has no other texture, isn't rubberized or textured in a way that helps prevent slippage.  It feels too smooth.  Couple that with the clunky 'speed bump' mechanism and it makes accurately scrolling the wheel difficult at best.  Definitely not a high performance feature, and honestly it doesn't work particularly well for normal use.  Not sure yet if it's a game-breaker, but it's at best a serious oversight.I'd love to love this, especially at the price point, but the wheel is such a constant issue that I'm not certain if it's something I can get past.\n\n"], "167": ["pos", "\n\n  good mouse and has what most people need.but its not all that great in the hands, my pinkie finger is pushed into a odd place that i dont care much forthe 2 programable buttons on the corner are not useable without taking youre hands off the mousethe metal scroll wheel has more noise then i would care for. and the metal ring makes the wheel free spin.the scroll wheel also feels chunky. not for methe mouse also seems to have some heft to it without the weights installedand it feels cheep overallthe razer deathadder is a overall better mouse if you are looking for somthing  that feels great in the hand. mine broke after 3 years but i can see why people put up with it\n\n"], "168": ["pos", "\n\n  I bought this mostly for FPS games. I have to say, it's one of the most ergonomic peripherals I've used, very comfortable. The DPI on the fly button is something I'm used to and consider necessary. It's pretty good. Left and right click are standard, not to tight, not too loose.The scroll wheel feels way too loose, regardless of whether the clicker is on or off. I am CONSTANTLY hitting the back button and navigating away from whatever page I'm on while browsing. I don't really see the use of some of these extra buttons just because it may be awkward to use reliably when they're all on a hair trigger.For the price, it's a great mouse and feels really solid. That accidental \"back\" click is my primary annoyance, and I rarely use a scroll wheel outside of browsing online anyway. Also appreciate that it only has one small light that will be covered by your hand while in use, and it doesn't shoot out some crazy lazer every time I pick it up.\n\n"], "169": ["neg", "\n\n  I bought this mouse because a few reviews indicated it was both a quality product and comfortable for people with big hands.While the former is true, the latter is only partially true. I wouldn't call it uncomfortable, but there's something about the angle your hand rests that makes certain actions a little awkward, at least for big hands.Trying to mash m1 quickly, for instance, is harder than previous mouses I've owned because pressing down on a slant causes horizontal movement, however slightly. It's mitigated somewhat by the curvature of the mouse 1 button, but it's still present.Another problem I have is that the DPI adjustment buttons are constantly being pressed by accident, one way or the other. There might be a way to lock those down, but that complicates the accessibility of variable DPI, so it's one or the other.The G Hub software is bloated and generally unpleasant to use, but required for full functionality.After owning the mouse for about six months, the notorious g502 left-click issues began. It was spotty for a little while, but now it can't hold a click at all, making it essentially unusable. Overall, the mouse looks nice and feels pretty good, but the invasive software and the shoddy craftsmanship on the switches make it not worth the money.\n\n"], "170": ["pos", "\n\n  It's a great mouse, it kills me that the scroll wheel sucks so much.  It's accurate, the weights system is great, the clicking feels awesome, it has a lot of customizable buttons, all in all it's pretty awesome.The scroll wheel is hot garbage.  It's made of metal, which everyone here seems to love, great, I don't have a problem with that part.  First issues is that it's SUPER hard to scroll with it, scrolling takes a lot more finger strength than on a regular mouse and that's bad enough, you can turn off the click scrolling for smooth but then you have the problem that it's way too lose.The biggest issue I have with it is how insanely sensitive the mouse is when it comes to left and right click on the wheel button.  This is one of the features I buy mice for because I use it all the time in games and for browsing, but it's INCREDIBLY sensitive on this mouse, I'm constantly click the left click on the scroll wheel when I'm just scrolling and a big part of it is that you have too apply so much strength to the scrolling that it makes you accidentally click all the time.I can unbind the left click to avoid this problem, but why would I? I literally bought the mouse for that feature...\n\n"], "171": ["pos", "\n\n  I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.Weight and SizeThe G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available.  However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it.  In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse.  This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features.  The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn\u2019t impact my ingame performance at all.  The thumb rest is really nice, so when I\u2019m doing regular tasks that don\u2019t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters.  Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better.  I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)ProsRubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnetThe cable is built like a tank.  No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.Mouse clicks are very light and responsiveThe number of buttons makes it a productivity machineThumbrest is supportiveThe sensor is completely flawless, no odd trackingYou can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?ConsRGB is almost pointless since it\u2019s covered up by your hand.When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a \u201cspringy\u201d sound (this won\u2019t happen as long as you don\u2019t aggressively mash your buttons)The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harshWhen shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattleThe mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dustWhile the cable is sturdy, it\u2019s not flexible and is super hard and heavy.  It also gets in the way sometimes.DPI button could be shifted back littleThe optional weights are almost completely uselessPerformanceThe mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions.  The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don\u2019t break my joints pressing down on the buttons.  The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that\u2019s a problem with every mouse).  I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I\u2019ll break the mouse.  This usually isn\u2019t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.Unlike others, I didn\u2019t \u201caccidentally\u201d click the DPI switch buttons.  I don\u2019t think you will either, unless you\u2019re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.FINAL VERDiCTDon't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it.  For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse.  Your experience will be much better.  But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out.  Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return.\n\n"], "172": ["pos", "\n\n  I've been using a G702 for many years now, and the switches were starting to go, so it was time to upgrade. Well, seeing reviews and knowing some people using this I decided to get it, so I got it and I can say that it's nice, but I like the G702 a lot better.Before I go too far, most negatives are about double-clicking, I have not experienced that nor has my friend that is also running this mouse.So far, I really do like this mouse, but I do have a few minor grips, and this is what seems to be just on the one I got and not on all. But, the textured covering over the weights is dragging on the mouse pad, which means that the skatez on this mouse are too short. It's an easy fix to just go out and buy new skatez, but, for a new product, I shouldn't have to yet. ** (Update, put on new skatez over the ones that came on there and it no longer drags.). **Other things I am not a fan of is this mouse is good for smaller hands, I feel. Also, the definition between the buttons are not very defined, and I feel you can easily click the wrong button. If the mouse was a little wider, I think it would be a bit more comfortable. This also may be because I am not use to it yet, but a little bump or something on the buttons along with being a little wider, those two small touches, I feel this could have been a better mouse.\n\n"], "173": ["pos", "\n\n  Overall I'm happy with this mouse. It connected easily enough and has a good amount of configurations available with the Logitech software. Weights are easy enough to add with a magnetic closure plate to make it sleek.Myonly complaint would be for the DPI. The two buttons next to the left mouse click, are reserved for on the fly DPI adjustment. You can either use them for that or disable them, they are not programmable. Why? Yes on the fly DPI adjustment is important for some, but why not make them programmable? And, why are they so big?. For DPI adjustments two smaller buttons would have been fine. Lastly, these buttons don't have a distinctive feel difference between the two or a separation that you can feel.

And it doesn't seem that I'm the one who keeps getting issues, it's a flaw in the construction. It's especially frustrating when trying to work and be productive because the double click causes a lot of issues with editing work or creating assignments. And when you're gaming, you're at a major disadvantage because it double clicks more in games than in general use. I play fps games most of the time (for example rainbow six siege) and when I try to shoot it stops shooting, it doesn't go full auto, Also for general use, when watching youtube whenever you want to pause it will sometimes put you in fullscreen.

It's especially annoying if I'm playing an FPS game or something where left clicking will fire the gun or toss the grenade I'm currently holding, in a game that has friendly fire.....yeah.It feels like the left/right click buttons on this mouse are a lot longer than they were on the G5 (pretty much anywhere above the big letter \"G\" on the mouse will left/right click). I've been dealing with it and just trying to make a conscious effort to keep my hand off the mouse as much as possible, but I'm probably going to shop around for a different mouse and maybe give this one to a friend or something. My old mouse that this one replaced was a Logitech G5 that I'd been using for over a decade, and I never had this problem with it.Again, I think it's probably a great mouse, and it's just me and the way I grip the mouse (especially hard to adjust when I'd been using the same G5 for over a decade, I guess), but that problem is making the mouse borderline unusable for me.\n\n"], "176": ["pos", "\n\n  I bought a G502 years ago, when the line first launched, and I loved it. I used it for hours each day for those years, and I never regretted that purchase. However, a few weeks ago the left mouse button started double clicking. I tried it with different computers and reset the settings on the mouse but nothing fixed it. It seems the switch is dying. I considered repairing it (and I still might), but the cost of parts is about 1/3 of a new mouse and I would also need something more advanced than the Radio Shack soldering iron I have somewhere in a drawer. So I bought the new G502 Hero. It is every bit as good as the original. In fact, they are practically the same mouse from the outside. The blue accents are gone from the original, and the logo is different, but otherwise they are identical. Of course, the sensor on the Hero is different, having a higher DPI range and requiring less power, but I haven't noticed a difference in my usage, because I typically stay between 1600 and 8000 DPI anyway. My only complaint in all of this is the software. I really wish there was a way to export settings from one mouse and import them to another, especially two mice which are so similar.

This mouse has cause significant problems when navigating important networking drives for work, as a simple click and drag results in the mouse arbitrarily rearranging my networks as the dragging doesnt complete and suddenly I am moving large sections of my network to other parts within said network due to the dragging being interrupted by the intermittent clicking.

Great ergonomics, great sensor...  If it could last a couple of years then maybe it'd be worth $50, but...  This is just straight up unacceptable out of a company as big as Logitech, and a switch that they say will last for 50 million clicks.  Granted... it still clicks.

When you try to flick with this mouse, chances are you'll overaim and miss due to the leftover inertia the mouse had. The fact that logitech would add attachable weights just  blows my mind. I've been using this mouse for the better part of a year now, and looking back at it, I regret that I didn't just buy a steelseries mouse instead.curvature of the mouse:This could just be a ME problem, but my hands are fairly average-sized. This mouse's curvature makes it so that in order to get a comfortable grip, your pinky and ring finger are forced to hang off the side and drag on my desk. If logitech added the thumb-rest bit, why couldn't they do the same for the pinky and ring finger?reliability:This could also just be a ME problem. I game a lot with this mouse, and so far it's held up great. However, some days the left mouse button (lmb) and right mouse button (rmb) would just stop working properly. For example, spraying a gun in CS:GO. If holding down the lmb, it would stutter and would stop shooting mid-spray. I've died countless times to this issue, and the same goes the the rmb. I don't abuse this mouse, never dropped it from even above KNEE height, and that's coming from a dude who's 5'7''._____________________PROS_____________________extremely customizable:Installing logitech G-hub is little to no hassle, and making macros makes using this mouse extremely fun. The feel of the material doesn't feel cheap at all (which for an 80$ mouse should be a given) and the curve of the mouse feels great on my hand.visually satisfying:it looks sleek and, for lack of a better word, cool. Nothing I could say could possibly change this.cool scroll button:you can toggle it between going by intervals or just flat-out spinning like a wheel. Pretty useful for any tasks that require spamming inputs really quickly._____________________CONCLUSION_____________________is it worth 80 bucks? No. You'd be better off buying a lighter mouse from steelseries, or maybe even a logitech g pro wireless when it goes on discount.

I had found the perfect mouse at one point, but it was discontinued and replaced with one that's terrible, so I'm using this one for now, and I'm happy enough with it.Update: After about 6 months, this mouse has broken in some way that makes it unusable.

The mass of this mouse could be an issue for some people, as they may notice some fatigue with constantly moving the mouse around. I'd say the only issues I've had so far have been getting the cable trained to lay how I want it and acclimating to the scroll wheel being a smooth metal surface rather than rubberized. Coming from a G500s, I miss the rubberized scroll wheel but not enough for this to be a major issue for me now that I'm used to the smoother metal. The cable takes a few days to fully train, depending on what shape it needs to be. Straightening it was simple enough and getting it to maintain a curve wasn't terribly hard. Within a week, I had the cable situated mostly how I wanted it.Gaming and general usage so far have been great. The range of DPI settings mean I can set exactly the speed I want and the DPI switching buttons are great for people who prefer having a few options for movement and aiming. The sensor seems to work on just about any normal desk surface. I've used mine on a couple mouse pads, wood, and glass.

I can't go to any other mouse now since to my knowledge none have that feature, and makes me wonder why other brands haven't universally adopted the feature.It is essentially, the perfect mouse except as others have mentioned, you are likely to start having problems with the left and right click 'double clicking' on press.  After hours of searching, I found a fix in a random youtube comment without having to pull the mouse apart by blowing out the left and right buttons, holding them down for 10s, shaking, twisting a bit, then holding down again and shaking some more somewhat carefully without being too rough.  It seems there must be some dust or grime that gets caught in the clicking mechanisms over time.  After that it was fixed and I didn't have problems again, but if I do I'll try it again.Certainly not a perfect fix and why I knocked off 2 stars on quality of material, but its better than having to switch to a different and inferior mouse.\n\n"], "191": ["pos", "\n\n  A fully programmable mouse with plenty of easy to reach buttons and a fun lighting scheme?

Even if you adjust your sensitivity or add some of the weights the mouse comes with it is still really sensitive. Maybe my kids just aren't good gamers, but they prefer my cheap Logitech wireless mouse over this one. For the price, I would not buy it again.\n\n"], "201": ["pos", "\n\n  The Logitech G502 in my opinion, is one of the best mice on the market you would ever get.Every button on the mouse is programmable, but there are 5 extras that you can use for DPI or macros.

I can keep a really good grip on the mouse, and its textured rubber on the sides help with gripping. I have quite large hands, and it still works flawlessly for me. Only thing is, depending on the person it might take some getting use to when you first use the mouse, as your hand might feel placed odd. People typically categorize how you hold the mouse in three types, palm, claw or hybrid. I personally use a hybrid grip on my mouse, for most control.It has a really large range for DPI, but of course most gamers don\u2019t use so high of a DPI speed, and it is only a marketing gimmick for your mouse to be that high.The mouse has on-board memory in case of no internet or if you need to play somewhere other than your house. It only saves your RGB profiles and your sensitivity/DPI profiles. This mouse cannot save macros onto the onboard memory.The RGB lighting of the mouse is lackluster, but that is fine by me. It has lightning for the Logitech logo itself, and the DPI lighting on the side. RGB for me is not a must, and is only a nice edition to have.Now the most important thing, the weight.This mouse weighs 125g, and comes with metal weights to make it heavier if wished. Personally, I keep it right at 125 grams in order to keep it down, but for me it actually doesn\u2019t matter. Some people might steer clear of this mouse because of that, and if you like lighter mice, this one isn\u2019t for you.The weight actually comes in advantage for me, as the weight of the mouse balances the speed at which I move it.There is one issue that is common for the mouse, and that is the dreaded double-click issue that occurs with the G502. The switches for the buttons may begin to register two presses. You can actually use the software to fix the issues, but that takes the use of macros away from you.Overall this mouse is a godsend, and is what made me use Logitech for all of my peripherals.\n\n"], "202": ["pos", "\n\n  I've had so many of these G502 mouses, reason being why so many is in the span of about 5-6 years.

I was pleasantly surprised at how easily I was able to program keys to the mouse via their software which didn't take very long to download. I just keep the program up at all times and If I feel like changing a button I can do so in less than 15 seconds. You could also close the program and open from your desktop in seconds. I have smaller hands for a guy but the mouse still feels great. If my hands were a little bit larger it would be perfect.I haven't had any mechanical issues. All the buttons work well (no double clicking). I love the feature of the mouse wheel where if you push the button in below the wheel, it either opens fully or restricts slightly the motion of the wheel. Basically, the one motion is like that of a normal mouse wheel and the other motion scrolls nearly indefinitely depending how fast you spin the wheel. It's really cool.I noticed that compared to any standard mouse I've ever used, my precision and accuracy of mouse movements has been greatly increased when using this mouse. I noticed this especially while gaming.I haven't messed around with the weights, but you can add/remove weights to make the mouse heavier/lighter. I'm just not interested in that and adapted to the default from delivery.The lighting options on the mouse are cool but that's just supplemental. It's everything else about the mouse that I like. I mean, we don't really look at our hand while we are on the computer much do we lol.Overall, It's a great mouse.

A year later, it has gotten to the point that I am looking for a replacement. I am also having issues with the scroll wheel failing to register when I attempt to scroll up, a problem I've never had with any other mouse before.For those not in the know, the issue I'm talking about causes the mouse to register multiple clicks from one tap of the left mouse button, causing double-clicks when you intend to do single clicks, and randomly registering additional clicks while attempting to click and drag. It doesn't happen on every click, but as the mouse ages, it happens more and more until it is eventually unusable. This is caused by Logitech using cheap switches that break quickly, and despite years of people complaining about this, they have not done anything about it, I guess because it's a net win for them as long as the warranty has expired before the problem starts.At this point I am convinced that the only way to avoid this problem is to find another brand for my next mouse. That said, I gave this 2 stars because it was great for those first 6 months.

Because they are literally right next to the left mouse button, it is super easy to accidentally press on it. I had to remove all other profiles from G Hub (Logitech Software), so that the 2 buttons are virtually disabled. Or I guess you can also functionally disable them in G Hub.

The result is that often, right click either doesn't scope me in at all, or it chaotically flies in and out of scope to terrible effect.I like the mouse so much that I'm to give it another chance. I know that there are others who have reported similar clicking issues, so it must be a manufacturing problem.

It will be noticeable when you get false double-clicks (i.e. when you meant to single click).In my case, had the problem from day 1, but initially thought I was accidentally double clicking & needed to get used to the mouse's button sensitivity.  But it got worse over time until it was clearly an issue with the mouse. Logitech support first had me install their \"G Hub\" software and update the firmware of the mouse. This seemed to correct the problem, but only for a couple weeks. This does seem to be something that gradually deteriorates in the switch mechanism of the buttons, and a software fix can only do so much.There is a website that can detect the fast/false clicks.  Logitech warranty support will want a video of you using this website that detects the false/fast clicks. See video I've attached, but note they will want a handheld video where you show the physical mouse in your hand and the website on screen, no edits, etc. (this is fair--they do have to protect themselves from fraudulent warranty claims).  Google \"fast double click test\" to find the website. The problem tends to come and go, and the likelihood of getting a fast/false click may depend on exactly how you are holding the mouse at that moment, which changes as you slide the mouse around or just shift your sitting position. For the video here I happened to find a hand position where it was happening most of the time, and carefully kept my hand in that position and pressed the button the same way each time.  More often I get around 10 bad clicks out of 100. Sometimes I get zero out of 100.I'll update this review after some time with the replacement.\n\n"], "229": ["pos", "\n\n  I have probably owned 15 or 20 different mice in my life and this one is definetely my favorite.I had been using a performance MX but wanted to step up to something with programmable buttons.

So I decided to order the G502 and give it a try.What a difference! I have slightly large hands, and even though this mouse has a slightly smaller footprint than the g602 it still fits my hand better. I mean it REALLY feels great in my hand.

My favorite feature is the mouse wheel is unlockable. You've got your normal clicky mouse wheel scrolling, but you can unlock it to make the wheel free-spinning. This is extremely useful in any game with a semi-auto weapon and a high fire rate (faster than you can normally click).

If you're trying to highlight text that means killing your selection and starting a new one. If you're moving a file it means dropping the file wherever happens to be when it decides you're not still holding the button, if you're playing a game, it can mean double spending on an attribute point or on a weapon that you hold to charge it can mean randomly shooting early.This problem isn't limited to the left mouse button, I've seen it happen on the right button as well where it continually flipped me in and out of sniper mode in games.It's a shame.

Also, a free spinning mouse wheel with a mechanical toggle switch was for sure something I didn't realize I needed in my life at the time.

The app's interface is also awful. There are only a few settings but almost a dozen different screens with mostly redundant information and options. Everything is just disabled if you prefer on-board settings. You cannot directly edit an on-board profile, which was a core functionality of the previous app. It may be better if you wanted to use the 'game profiles' feature but I think that's a sad excuse to permanently run a spyware program that scans all your installed programs and processes just for your mouse settings (just use the games' settings...).The old app and onboard setting had its issues but actually worked, so I find these problems to be pretty glaring.Update 2/22: this mouse has intermittent jumping issues and the software has not improved.

The mouse does good clicky things, all the buttons feel solid and the mouse is responsive. The thumb rest is great well positioned, but the mouse is too narrow overall for a good palm grip. I also use a write pad with my mouse and so the sharp falloff combined with the narrow body mean that only half my palm is actually on the mouse. I either have to scrunch my hand up to keep my hand off the pad or drag part of my hand around.

Left click does NOT hold after a few month of usage.  while my friend recommended this mouse to me and has not had an issue, I'm currently on my FOURTH logitech hero as of yesterday.  replacement takes 3-4 weeks time and it is tedious.

No issues whatsoever.The experience left me with pretty mixed feelings overall.I'd say the mouse would probably get a 4/5 star with the LGS software.

The odd shape and size of the mouse. This mouse is quite large and has a contour on the right side that can cause your hand to slide off. I personally like the size because I have medium size hands but like to rest my palm far back on the mouse with a palm grip. I don't care for the contour however because it causes my hand to slide to that side and doesn't support my fingers over there. That can cause my thumb to rub up against the buttons on the right side uncomfortably.2.) The buttons on this mouse are somewhat looser than your standard mouse. By this I mean they have less resistance to pressing and tend to wiggle more. This mainly applies to the two main mouse buttons and the scroll wheel. I'm used to using mice like this, but for those who aren't it can take some adjusting to get used to it.3.) Another concern is (although it may not be the case in every mouse) the build quality. When I originally received my mouse, the left mouse button was setting slightly lower than the other buttons. This doesn't cause a functionality issue, but it causes my index finger to rub up along the ridge in between the dpi buttons and the left mouse button.There are plenty of great features I noticed about this product, but I thought I would point out some of the features that aren't necessarily bad but may turn some people away.Update after about 8 months of use:The pads at the bottom of the mouse tend to slide around a little bit which causes the resin that holds them to the bottom of the mouse to come out from under the pads. This is annoying because it tends to get on my mouse pad and also collects a lot of dust around the pad (which is hard to clean) where the resin is exposed.\n\n"], "440": ["pos", "\n\n  This is my second G502.

My previous mouse, a Corsair Dark Core RBG, had completely lost all functionality only after two years from purchase.

I've used previous Logitech equipment some odd years ago for general computer use and thought I would take the plunge on the gaming aspect of the brand. Needless to say, i'm glad I did and the good reviews for this product are well-deserved.The mouse feels wonderful to hold. I was worried at first because it did feel a little light and hollow out of the box. This is where the included five 3.6g weights come into play. The weights act to give some stability for higher DPI settings and also give some weight to help with maneuvering the mouse on certain surfaces. This part might actually be tricky upon getting it out of the box as I had to mess around and add/remove weights until I just got the right natural feeling when moving it. This was not too huge of an issue as even the Logitech website had recommended adjusting the weights until you feel what works. I'm glad the ability to change the weight was included as I have big hands and need an ample amount of weight for the mouse to feel great in my palm. The middle mouse wheel is unique in that it has a toggle button for a dual-mode use; one has the mouse wheel scroll freely and super smoothly (perfect for browsing or getting to the top/bottom of a page with just a quick flick) and the other mode is a \"scroll clicker,\" perfect for making precise digital art or designs or when you need to swap out to that second weapon in your favorite FPS. Its because of this that the mouse has more functionality beyond just gaming.The ergonomic build is great as well. No matter how I hold it, the mouse feels like it melds into the shape of my palm and thumb. The thumb rest is a nice addition too, keeping my thumb from sinking too low or dragging around my mousepad. The quality of the entire mouse is just awesome. Everything from the material used to the lighting effects and the design itself is perfect.

Great response time, great customization for mouse functions, feels great in the hand, all around great.

The weights fit very tightly in both the mouse and the case, and they're kind of annoying to put in and take out. 2. The RGB customization is not that great. You can only do 3 effects, one of which you have no choice of colors, but RGB is probably the least important part of the mouse, so not a bug deal.  And one issue that I think was just because mine was a bit faulty, the color of the RGB is off. When I set it to white (R255 G255 B255) it appears blueish green. to make it look white, I have to set it to R255 G160 B160, and then it looks like a perfect white. So I think the red lighting is weak, so I gets overpowered by the Green and blue. Another example of this is when I set it to yellow, it appears green with a tint of yellow.  Keep in mind, the cons were just minor things. Weights fitting weird, slight RGB issues, etc. are not big things, don't let them keep you from buying this mouse. This is an incredible product, I've tried other mice, and I would always go with the G502 series without hesitation, and they are by far the most comfortable mice I've ever held.

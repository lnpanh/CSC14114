90	neg	So if you want to change DPI, Polling Rate, or any of the button functions, you need G Hub running at all times
90	neg	For folks like me who like to squeeze as much performance from their machines as possible, this is unacceptable
90	neg	In my task manager right now there are 6 different G Hub
90	neg	exes using up a total of 246 CPU threads, and an absurd 300mb of RAM
90	neg	If the mouse had working on-board memory this wouldn't even be worth mentioning, but it doesn't, so it is
90	neg	Coming from a G700 (another Logitech mouse) I thought this mouse would be an upgrade, little did I know that my 7 year old mouse was leaps and bounds ahead of this modern brick
90	neg	My G700 also needed Logitech software to customize, but it had WORKING ON-BOARD MEMORY, meaning if I wanted to set the DPI and save it to the mouse for use on another PC I could easily do so, with the new G Hub software this is impossible
91	pos	07/19/2021I've bought this product twice, once back in November of 2019, a second time a week ago
91	pos	The issue was that the left click was no longer working as intended
91	pos	I was not able to click and drag anything and would occasionally register a double click
91	pos	Apparently this is a common issue, but at the price, I just couldn't find another mouse that could compete
91	pos	At the price, it's reasonable, I just wish if it was such a common issue, for it to have been fixed already especially since it's one of their more popular gaming mouse
91	pos	Since then, I've also purchased a MX Master 3 and use them side by side depending on my uses
91	pos	It's still one of the better gaming mouse out there, especially for the price
92	pos	To fully take advantage of this mouse's precision, go to the mouse settings on Windows, set it to the slowest setting, then go into the Logitech software and up the DPI
92	pos	This will give you the most precise tracking you can get from the mouse
92	pos	A lost of people seem to just use a lower DPI in the mouse software and wonder why with small movements, the mouse becomes jumpy
92	pos	Don't be that person
92	pos	Set up your software correctly
92	pos	And why do you want to do it this way
92	pos	Well, because the mouse has buttons with which you can slow it down or speed it back up anytime - it works in normal windows mode and in games on a hardware level and there is no adjustment needed after you set it up initially
92	pos	The other way round, you would have to go into game and/or Windows settings to make those changes
92	pos	PS: I also have the G900 and G903 with PowerPlay
92	pos	I use the G502 HERO for my work machine I mainly use for office work and I used a cheaper mouse before that was just so annoying when trying to pull on Excel cell corners - you need the precision at that place
92	pos	However, I didn't want to break the bank after spending over $200 for a wireless low latency setup on my gaming PC
92	pos	This mouse has all that for less than $50 with the only limitation that it is wired
92	pos	I love heavier mice and this one has weights
92	pos	Surely a Plus as well for me
93	neg	if you want a great gaming mouse that remembers your settings, this is NOT what you're looking for
93	neg	look
93	neg	all the other positive reviews about the features, buttons, button sets, etc
93	neg	are true
93	neg	this has the potential to be SUCH a great mouse
93	neg	but *EVERY* time it does an update to its software (which is at least once a week) it WIPES OUT all your settings
93	neg	so you have to go back through and ONE BY ONE put each setting back on each button
93	neg	sometimes 3 times a week
93	neg	logitech has confirmed this is the EXPECTED behavior
93	neg	the "work around"
93	neg	they expect YOu to export your settings to the cloud, and then reimport EVERY time it updates
93	neg	so i turned off auto updates
93	neg	guess what
93	neg	IT AUTO UPDATES ANYWAY
93	neg	it COMPLETELY ignores your settings to not update
93	neg	this behavior exists on both mac and pc
93	neg	THIS
93	neg	THING
93	neg	IS
93	neg	GARBAGE
94	pos	I’ve read a lot of reviews where people complain about a double clicking issue or uncomfortable button locations and stuff so I thought I’d share my thoughts
94	pos	I got it a week ago and so far I’ve experienced zero issues with it whatsoever but the double clicking problem usually doesn’t develop until later so if it does come up eventually, I will update my review
94	pos	The sensor is this mouse is legit, one of the best I’ve ever come across and I’ve used a lot of gaming mice in my life
94	pos	From Razer to Alienware, this one competes with the best of them
94	pos	The adjustable weights are also a plus
94	pos	I’m not hardcore on FPS so I don’t use them but they can come in handy for those of you who are into shooters
94	pos	The extra buttons are also a big plus
94	pos	It has a couple and they can be very useful
94	pos	The only downside I can think of is the mouse itself is rather a bit small for my taste and I think it could use a pinky support but I do have large hands so perhaps it isn’t applicable for everyone
94	pos	Also while it does have many extra buttons, the thumb one is awkwardly positioned right under the thumb so I frequently press it by mistake
94	pos	The two index finger buttons next to left click are also a bit inconvenient because one would have to move the index finger off the important left click to use them
94	pos	Conclusion: I got it on sale for $39
94	pos	99 and for the price it’s a fantastic deal
94	pos	At its full price of $80 however they may be better options but either way, it is a solid product
95	pos	I've always loved the Magic Mouse and can't give that up because of the multitouch features, but this mouse is so comfortable, and moves so effortlessly, I actually look forward to using it for gaming
95	pos	Once I got it configured for a particular game, it's actually improved my playing because of the multi-button functionality
95	pos	Moving functions to the mouse instead of trying to handle multiple actions at once on the keyboard has been a huge benefit, and has actually made the game more enjoyable to play
95	pos	Nothing can replace the multi-gesture functionality of Apple's Magic Mouse surface, but this is fully in use now and I really enjoy it
95	pos	It feels very solid and slides effortlessly
95	pos	I have a small hand that has no trouble reaching all the buttons and features, and its response rate is fantastic
96	pos	So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5
96	pos	It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right
96	pos	Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great
96	pos	Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse
96	pos	The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached
96	pos	I saw another review with a similar complaint
96	pos	The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse
96	pos	It's apparently an issue
96	pos	Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb
96	pos	The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far
96	pos	I have pretty large hands
96	pos	XXL for gloves
96	pos	That button is way to far forward
96	pos	Finally, compared to the G5
96	pos	This thing feels really cheap
96	pos	The buttons are super flimsy
96	pos	The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance
96	pos	I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it
96	pos	I don't know
96	pos	I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid
96	pos	Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap
96	pos	Had I paid full price, I would be returning it
96	pos	Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more
96	pos	No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though
96	pos	Update:Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues
96	pos	First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse
96	pos	Which is fine
96	pos	The old Logitech software sucked
96	pos	Hard
96	pos	Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better
96	pos	First, it wants to do a firmware update
96	pos	So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware
96	pos	If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in
96	pos	That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software
96	pos	Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so
96	pos	You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays
96	pos	When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing
96	pos	Yet, it won't be doing it
96	pos	For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default
96	pos	So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there
96	pos	dark
96	pos	The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time
96	pos	But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights
96	pos	Instead you have to click on the main "Settings" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time
96	pos	I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this
96	pos	Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box
96	pos	Dumb dumb dumb
96	pos	I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb
96	pos	That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI
96	pos	That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much
96	pos	With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way
96	pos	As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly
96	pos	They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing
96	pos	I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice
96	pos	Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed
96	pos	Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use
96	pos	The center wheel
96	pos	Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy
96	pos	Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out
96	pos	Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture
96	pos	Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world
96	pos	Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel
96	pos	There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth
96	pos	Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars
96	pos	I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though
96	pos	It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box
96	pos	And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well
96	pos	I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well
96	pos	Still braided, but way more flexible
96	pos	Hopefully it holds up as well
97	pos	So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it
97	pos	First is the design:The design, while unusual, works fairly well
97	pos	I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons
97	pos	Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it
97	pos	It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do
97	pos	The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed
97	pos	It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons
97	pos	Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button)
97	pos	As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable
97	pos	If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB
97	pos	The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games
97	pos	In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play
97	pos	Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it
97	pos	Second is the software:The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same
97	pos	Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you
97	pos	It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind
97	pos	One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button)
97	pos	All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it
97	pos	G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded
97	pos	(G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside
97	pos	Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates
97	pos	Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well
97	pos	Third is the delivery:It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area
97	pos	I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive
97	pos	Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing
97	pos	As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time
97	pos	If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far
97	pos	But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly
98	pos	This is a fantastic mouse
98	pos	The buttons and even the scroll wheel are PERFECTLY clicky
98	pos	If you don't like that, the scroll wheel "click" can be turned off with the button directly under it, so it free spins
98	pos	You can also download it's user interface where you can download other users set-ups for specific games, etc
98	pos	and can built your own, along with setting up the "G" logo color palette
98	pos	The color vibrance and transition is so smooth and bright looking, I actually left it rainbow (my pics did not at all do the colors justice)
98	pos	The sides are rubberized, which provides excellent control for button use
98	pos	The 2 thumb buttons, 1 in front of the thumb rest & 1 above, and the 2 on the left button are extremely well placed, easy to use, but do not get accidently pushed easily
98	pos	The bottom is slighlt gridded for friction & the wire is covered in woven nylon & runs about 6 ft
98	pos	Oh, and it comes with a 5 pack of weights in their own case
98	pos	I couldn't be happier with this mouse
99	pos	I upgraded from Razer Basilisk (wired) and I would say, it is an upgrade
99	pos	Way better/more customization option, buttons clicks really good and overall build quality is awesome despite the cost of this mouse just being 40$
99	pos	Little plastic container contains multiple weights to weigh down your mouse is a surprise for me
99	pos	Those thing fits under discretely
99	pos	Now, there's one issue that has been really bothering me is the placement of G7 and G8 buttons mainly meant for upping and lowering DPI sensitivity into however many DPI stages you've added in G-Hub
99	pos	Placement sucks
99	pos	Left click is narrow and I can easily hit G7 and lowers my DPI sensitivity making me die, a lot while playing FPS such as Halo Infinite or while browsing through the internet I accidentally lower my DPI when I just want to casually browse
99	pos	If it was placed differently or had stiffer click to prevent accidents, then I wouldn't have any issues
99	pos	"But you can turn them off
99	pos	" Everyone has a different playing style and customization, I personally need them to adjust for whatever games I play so I keep accidentally lowering my sensitivity mid-game, it just ruins the moment
99	pos	Other than that issue, overall mouse is really good
99	pos	Like, actually good
100	neg	The weights are good but standard
100	neg	The resolution as expected
100	neg	Button presses require very little force (I would bet the switches would be the first things to fail)
100	neg	Update few months later: docked two stars, left button has developed switch bounce and now sometimes clicks multiple times with one press of the button
100	neg	Update months laterer: Oh man, you're gonna love this
100	neg	Button got worse (couldn't even drag anything; real fun playing the "which folder did the file get dropped into
100	neg	" game) then the right button started to display similar issues
100	neg	Logitech did send me a new one, buuuuuut
100	neg	It took me a month or two to actually get the warranty process started and it's a huge hassle
100	neg	Even once the warranty process starts and someone actually contacts you, it's only to give you a many-steps email to get you to do the troubleshooting for them (including removing their own software which makes sense as it's basically malware; it's bad)
100	neg	They make you, no joke, record a video of you clicking on a website they send you to with:- the mouse visible,- the website url visible,- the "double click counter" visible, AND- a HANDWRITTEN NOTE with the ticket number written on it
100	neg	If you can jump through all those flaming hoops and prove that, indeed, the issue you said it had (months ago) was really real they're going to have you then take a picture with:- the mouse visible,- the S/N visible (and it has to be the one on the product, not the box), AND-
100	neg	ANOTHER handwritten note with the S/N and the ticket number written on it
100	neg	I'll be honest, I expected them to next request I take a picture of myself holding the mouse with the ticket number scratched into my forehead while holding a newspaper like some sort of kidnapping victim
100	neg	They didn't ask for that, however; instead, they asked for all of my details and sent me a new one
100	neg	So, in summary:- they replaced defective product and I love being able to drag files or select text again, that's one (1) shiny gold star for Logitech added
100	neg	- they made the process so painful I'd rather have a cage-match with a gang of feral cats all hopped up on catnip and PCP than go through it again, TWO STAR: MINUS  >:-[If yours develops any issue at all during Amazon return/replace period, do it before that time runs out
100	neg	Interestingly, they don't even seem to want the mouse with the bad switch back, which would be an easy/cheap fix
100	neg	I thought they made me go through all that 'cause they're so expensive to make or something, heck they already spent a lot of money on labor hours, but
100	neg	nope
100	neg	That's right, the expensive (well
100	neg	more than $10) mouse they want you to perform 3 miracles to replace isn't worth shipping that tiny box over
101	pos	Generally, you hear a lot of good things about Logitech mice, but this one might possibly be the best one from them
101	pos	Between being able to customize the other buttons on your mouse, on top of your DPI, but it also has an unlockable mouse wheel
101	pos	Scrolling through a big inventory, or a long thread online
101	pos	Unhinge that bad boy, blare some eurobeat, and rip your finger off of the wheel
101	pos	The wheel itself is comfortable, and really sturdy when you're clicking, or even scrolling
101	pos	The other buttons don't get in the way of your clicks, and the wheel lock is completely out of the way when you're using it
101	pos	The only (probably personal) issue I have so far is, my mouse does glitch out, and moves either in one direction, or spasms
101	pos	I don't have any dust, nor debris on my mouth, so I'm unsure if I have a faulty mouse, or it could be one of those model-specific issues
101	pos	Regardless of that, this is a really nice mouse for its price
101	pos	The firmware is great (not needed), the mouse is comfortable, and if you're a fan of weighted mice like I am, it has a sizeable, adjustable weight you can fit inside
102	neg	Have gone through two of these mice already and same issue both times
102	neg	After about a year the mouse will cause the camera to look straight up and the M2 (right click) button completely gives out
102	neg	Good luck playing any FPS game without rage quitting when this inevitably occurs
102	neg	Its disappointing because brand new, the G520 Hero is a great gaming mouse
102	neg	It fits nicely in the hand, has adjustable weights, and the perfect number of buttons for most gaming styles
102	neg	Would love to purchase another but can not justify throwing more money at Logitech for a product I know will fail within a year
103	pos	The G502 is replacing two faulty Corsairs - the M65 Pro RGB and the Harpoon RGB
103	pos	Both are having typical left click failures, so I wanted something heavy with a larger footprint like the M65
103	pos	Logitech got a lot right with this design, which is why I'm not surprised it hasn't changed much over the years
103	pos	The ability to add weights is a huge plus for me since I love a large, heavy mouse for some weird reason
103	pos	The magnetic flap is one of my favorite design choices as well - it's dead simple and honestly really cool
103	pos	The scroll wheel is solid and tactile, and provides a rewarding click when using
103	pos	With the scroll button disengaged, the scroll wheel is buttery smoooooth
103	pos	I definitely dig it, especially because this mouse pulls double-duty between my gaming PC and my work laptop
103	pos	Honestly, the only issue I've found is that DPI switches positioned essentially on the left click (G7 and G8) can prove to be an annoyance if you miss the click and unintentionally increase/decrease the DPI
103	pos	I think this issue is mainly on me, though
103	pos	I change up my grips periodically, so it's really just acclimatizing to the mouse at this point
103	pos	Overall, I really dig the G502
103	pos	I've always avoided Logitech products because of their "office" products, but this mouse has definitely exceeded my expectations so far
103	pos	Since I'm still breaking it in, I'll probably update this review if it starts doing anything wonky
104	pos	I am having tracking issues with mine
104	pos	It's mainly my table to blame, but my Razor mouse don't have a problem with my desk and mouse pad
104	pos	The software does not allow me to calibrate my sensor for my mouse pad nor does it let me adjust the lift off distance like Razor software can
104	pos	My table is plastic table and the weight of my pc and monitor bow the middle of the my table causing a sunk in effect
104	pos	My table also has ripples / waves you can feel with your hand when you slide across
104	pos	The mouse pad I have hides the ripples to some degree
104	pos	So this mouse not taking a liking to this and thus not working out for me
104	pos	But when using it, you can feel it hang on something and stop moving for a sec
104	pos	My Razor mouse does not have any issue
104	pos	You can glide my Razor mouse across gravel and it still make head shots
104	pos	But this mouse not working for me
105	pos	I got this to replace a Logitech G403 Prodigy that I've had and enjoyed for 3yrs but recently developed a failing left-click switch
105	pos	I got this instead of another G403 because it was a little cheaper, apparently "the most popular gaming mouse", and has more buttons (though I don't think I'd really need all the extras)
105	pos	Two issues immediately stood out
105	pos	First, my ring finger has a place to rest on the right edge of the G403, while this mouse doesn't quite have room for it, so I'd need to modify my grip to either squeeze it on with my middle finger, or drop it over the side
105	pos	It probably wouldn't be a huge deal in the long run, but I noticed the difference in ergonomics right away
105	pos	Second, and the reason I chose to immediately return the mouse and order another G403 (a HERO this time, because that's what's available) is the scrollwheel
105	pos	The G502 scrollwheel has a slick metal surface that's almost slippery, and a LOUD clicking in step-mode
105	pos	The button for switching to smooth scrolling is a nice feature, but in step mode it's just too clunky
105	pos	By contrast, the G403 has a rubberized wheel surface that requires very little force to use and light detents that silently provide just the right amount of feedback for stepped scrolling without adding appreciable resistance
106	neg	I had an iBuyPower mouse that lasted me six years I got for $11 at a thrift store
106	neg	This g502 Logitech Hero hasn't even lasted me two years
106	neg	I was waiting to review this for this purpose
106	neg	I'm now back to using the thrift store mouse because the g502 Hero is no longer functioning
106	neg	The upside: The mouse feels nice and glides effortlessly across most surfaces
106	neg	It is comfortable
106	neg	Primary Issues: Comfort is about all this piece of junk has going for it
106	neg	Left click doesn't double click all the time, and actually stopped "clicking" a few months into use so now I just have to guess since there is no audible click or touch-sensory click
106	neg	The right click doesn't work at all most of the time and that's important for some games and functions I use on my computer, so I have to use my other mouse entirely for that purpose
106	neg	Glider Wheel broke several months in
106	neg	I was able to fix it by cleaning it out the first time, thinking it was just general build up or something, but the second time the button which allows you to utilize the smooth wheel versus the click wheel went out, and any time I try to up-scroll it doesn't register as a scroll and instead registers as me clicking the wheel
106	neg	Again, the right click stopped working
106	neg	It still clicks, I can feel it, I can hear it, but the mouse doesn't react
106	neg	I disassembled, cleaned, reassembled and still nothing
106	neg	Unreliable DPI stability feature
106	neg	Sometimes my DPI will drop well below acceptable usability, then recover on its own
106	neg	The entire software setup, this gHub or whatever, is absolute garbage
106	neg	Completely
106	neg	Ridiculous
106	neg	Trash
106	neg	It is a convoluted mess requiring so much more work than is necessary to use
106	neg	It crashes for no reason despite updates, does not save profiles, does not let you utilize macros, is not user friendly, and requires manual startup
106	neg	If you click to open it, it just sits on the "Update" screen indefinitely
106	neg	There are too many other things I want to say about this product, but overall, and being a lifelong fan of Logitech, I'm more than disappointed
106	neg	This is the second g502 Hero I've bought (the one I bought from Amazon was New/Unused) and to be quite honest I'd rather go through another company than deal with these issues anymore
106	neg	I won't be using their "gaming" mice ever again
107	pos	Someone said this is too heavy
107	pos	I don't think it is
107	pos	It's lighter than my old gaming mouse that broke
107	pos	It has too many buttons and some are near the primary ones
107	pos	You have to be careful how you hold your hand or you find yourself changing your sensitivity by accident
107	pos	Logitech's cancerous G-Hub program is required to set it up initially, but once you set the onboard memory it will work without it
107	pos	G-Hub did not work on Win 7 for me, and there's no Linux support
107	pos	You will need Windows 8+ to configure it
107	pos	I feel we're going backwards in technology and user experience here
108	pos	About a year ago I decided to get back to PC gaming
108	pos	I had started streaming and after mostly PS4 content with an underwhelming laptop to boot, I upgraded to a desktop last year which came with a good “gaming mouse”
108	pos	It was comfortable to use so I never put much thought into it
108	pos	About a month ago I decided to look around for a mouse though to see if it was even worth upgrading, talked to a few friends and they all recommended the G502
108	pos	I’ve known the Logitech brand for quite a few years and have used their cheaper wireless mice for my laptop so figured I’d give this one a shot
108	pos	And holy cow is this an awesome mouse
108	pos	The customization features in the Logitech Software alone is super easy to use and make adjustments for later
108	pos	Set different levels of sensitivity for my needs, set up the extra mouse buttons for different purposes in different games
108	pos	I’m still struggling to adjust to a mouse and keyboard after having a controller in my hands for almost three decades, this mouse has greatly assisted in my transition into the PC world
108	pos	Console gamers looking to dive into PC, give this mouse a shot, it has enough customization options to fit just about anyone’s needs
109	pos	I have/was a Razer fanboy for years
109	pos	Unfortunately razer products have started to go downhill & any support has become virtually laughable if best
109	pos	This isn't a crap on razer review but more a "thank god I found an alternative"
109	pos	When switching from my 3rd razer death adder to my first logitech G502, I immediately felt "comfortable"
109	pos	Added weights gave me the feel I wanted
109	pos	The ergonomics felt right, & the mouse overall just WORKED
109	pos	I am a huge fan if the scroll wheel now also & the fact that you can set it to both standard & infinite scroll is a nice touch
109	pos	Been several months now & I think it's time I make the complete jump for the rest of my products
109	pos	My current keyboard now randomly changes audio & phantom types keys from time to time
109	pos	Not something you want while gaming
110	pos	This is an extremely precise and reliable mouse, both with movement and scroll wheel
110	pos	The only annoying thing about it is the non-adjustable "thunk" of the scroll wheel, it's too "notchy"
110	pos	You can engage/disengage that notch, but:- if you disengage it, the scroll wheel becomes too sensitive, the slightest touch and it scrolls
110	pos	- if you engage it, the scroll wheel has a super annoying "thunk" every time you turn the mouse wheel
110	pos	becomes extremely precise, but super annoying (feel and sound)Tried the MX3 before this one -> the MX3 was better built, had a better scroll wheel feel, but was glitchy every so often (the scroll wheel was precise only ~99% of the time, couldn't find a way to get rid of that glitchiness in their "Logi Options" software, tried all possible settings/sensitivity)
110	pos	In the end, I went with the razer basilisk -> extremely precise, scroll wheel sensitivity can be adjusted with a knob under the mouse (no software needed
110	pos	- I hate having to install mouse/keyboard software, for any reason)
111	pos	This is competing with the g300s for my favorite mouse
111	pos	Buttons: It has enough buttons to assign several functions to them in games without going overboard
111	pos	I really wanted a mouse with extra buttons directly adjacent to the M1 or M2 button like the g300s had and this one has two next to the M1 button and a couple of thumb buttons
111	pos	Weight: Medium to heavy depending on weights added
111	pos	There is a hinged magnetic "door" on the bottom of the mouse that makes it extremely easy to adjust the weight of the mouse on a whim
111	pos	My g300s was ultra lightweight, which made flick shots extremely easy but glidey tracking wasn't perfectly smooth
111	pos	This one glides extremely well and flicks well with the weights taken out
111	pos	Adding too much weight can cause overshoot or a kind of rubber banding effect when I throw my hand quickly, but more weight feels like it has easier gliding and tracking
111	pos	Features: This has things like profile shifting and a temporary dpi shift "sniper" button but I never use those
111	pos	It does have a scroll wheel lock and unlock button that lets you choose between the clicky single line scrolling or the friction free high speed scrolling, which I change all the time as needed
111	pos	Usually for browsing
111	pos	Software: Let's you change your lights, button assignments, make macros, etc
111	pos	The usual
111	pos	Cons: The only minor con is that the scroll wheel very slightly jiggles when flicking the mouse quickly
111	pos	It has never caused me problems, but I can feel it when it happens
111	pos	I fixed it by using a thin nylon washer with a slit cut in it so I could lower it on the "axle" the scroll wheel is attached to
111	pos	The jiggle was nearly eliminated and the friction free scrolling still works fine
112	pos	I really wanted to love this mouse
112	pos	I am a casual gamer, and I thought this would up my game a bit with precision and programmable buttons, etc
112	pos	Sadly, after using it for an afternoon, I found to be a poor choice for me
112	pos	Pros:-The smoothness of the sensing is excellent
112	pos	I felt my ability to pick precise targets in shooting scenarios would be enhanced compared to my old Microsoft mouse
112	pos	-The ability to switch the scroll button to free-wheeling is handy and satisfying
112	pos	-Materials do seem to be nice and solid
112	pos	-The weights are a nice touch for customizability
112	pos	-The lights add visual appeal without being too flashy
112	pos	Colors are customizeable
112	pos	-The quantity of buttons available is good, and their locations are easily accessible by fingers without accidental touches just from gripping the mouse itself
112	pos	-The sliding surfaces on the bottom are smooth and large
112	pos	-The feel in my larger than average hands was nice
112	pos	Ergonomics were good compared to a more standard shape
112	pos	-The thumb button for engaging low DPI would be good if I could get used to it
112	pos	-The multiple profiles available for single or multiple customized DPI & programmed button settings is nice
112	pos	Cons:-There's too much resistance on the scroll wheel when free-wheeling is disengaged
112	pos	When my fingers were dry, they would actually slip on the metal wheel surface instead of rolling it
112	pos	-The left/right bump buttons on the scroll wheel are easy to press, but the center scroll button is hard to press
112	pos	I found it very difficult to consistently press only the center scroll button
112	pos	Most of the time I was accidentally pressing down and left or right at the same time
112	pos	-My habit of wedging my thumb against the mouse pad and mouse for extra precision is not possible with this mouse due to the ergonomic wing shape on the left side
112	pos	I found this highly annoying, and it made it harder for me to hit targets
112	pos	If I could get used to toggling the DPI on the fly, this might be ok, but for $50 I don't want to work that hard to love it
113	neg	I don't write reviews much but look another way for a gaming mouse
113	neg	The left click works when it wants too
113	neg	I play FPS shooters and much other games, but the clicks have been giving me issues
113	neg	When ADS in FPS shooters, it's like the mouse is in rapid fire or its to sensitive with clicks and acts like a double or triple click and this is really annoying in gaming or even casual use as when you try to drag and drop or click on a folder or app it will double or triple click most of the time
113	neg	I would've returned it but its been sometime
113	neg	Not sure if I would get another Logitech mouse as I've been let down twice already
113	neg	The other products they make are great but the mice in my experience are terrible
114	neg	I just wanted a simple mouse for a cheap price but I guess you get what you pay for
114	neg	I’ve had good luck with Logitech products in the past so I figured this mouse would be decent
114	neg	There’s not a lot of good, long-lasting gaming mice on the market anymore and I was worried about spending too much just to have them stop working in a couple months
114	neg	This one was great at first and appeared to work just right, and didn’t give me the dreaded double-click issue I had with previous gaming mice but after a month, the cursor started to do its own thing
114	neg	It would randomly drag itself across the screen and freeze and I’d have to unplug and re-plug-in the mouse to my computer in order for it to start up again
114	neg	Super annoying after the first two or three times and it began doing it more often as time went on
114	neg	I thought it was a computer issue but it did the same thing on other devices
114	neg	I ended up getting a different mouse recently
114	neg	This one is not worth buying
115	neg	G502 Hero Mouse from Logitech, Review
115	neg	I've been buying the "Inferior", non-"sick
115	neg	" G300s several years
115	neg	I've owned owned a total of three G300's
115	neg	Even though the G300s physically decay like cake in the rain, I strongly recommend buying a G300s instead of this G502 piece of absolute garbage
115	neg	LET ME EXPLAIN:To start, the Hand-Feel for me is really bad, and I usually end up holding it in a way that makes reaching two of the Thumb buttons very awkward
115	neg	I normally get Ambidextrous mice , so that's my fault
115	neg	And really, it's also my fault for having strange hands
115	neg	But that's not what makes the G502 the worst mouse I've touched in over a decade
115	neg	NEGATIVES:What is NOT my fault is the overly sensitive Click Pressure on all the face and side buttons
115	neg	I don't know if that's an intended feature, or I just got mouse from a lot that was over-tuned
115	neg	But it's far too easy to accidentally click when sliding the mouse across the pad
115	neg	ANY resistance from your surface and CLICK
115	neg	Glance any part of a button that isn't the exact center: CLICK
115	neg	Gently feel for where the buttons are in the dark, while being careful to use far less force than should reasonably be needed to depress a button far enough to engage the mechanism : CLICK
115	neg	CLICKCLICK
115	neg	CLICK
115	neg	MORE NEGATIVES:The Mouse Wheel has to be some cruel experiment in psychological warfare
115	neg	The Lock/Unlock implementation warrants detailed comment in both states
115	neg	Beyond the fact that it is an unwanted feature at the best of times -- when gaming, it will actively hinder your enjoyment and performance -- unless you dedicate your life mastering it, and I have no intention of doing anything remotely close to that
115	neg	* As a free spinning wheel, it fails due to floatiness
115	neg	Unless you just want to rip-scroll through several pages of product reviews on Amazon to record for a video project, it has no use case that is superior to any other scrolling function available to users, and that includes the Middle Mouse Button scrolling that the mouse still possesses (I'll get to MMB issues later)
115	neg	* As a tick wheel, it FAILS because the ratchet is far too loose to be trusted
115	neg	You get this awful effect where physically, the wheel will "back rock" or fore rock" to cradle itself between the teeth
115	neg	This then causes your scroll selection to tick up or down onto something other than your intent
115	neg	Not always, mind you
115	neg	But enough (and unpredictably so) to seriously impede, if not, ruin whatever gaming moment you might have been having
115	neg	Further exacerbating the issue is you cannot change the internal DPI of the mouse wheel sensor
115	neg	Not with your OS, not with G HUB, not with ANYTHING
115	neg	You can only change how your Operating System MULTIPLIES the Wheel Motion
115	neg	And even with a 1:1 multiple, you get that selection rocking issue
115	neg	And anything LESS than 1:1 results in no scrolling whatsoever unless you unlock and rip-scroll
115	neg	MOAR NEGATIVES:Oh and this is all before the issues of trying to get a clean Click out of the Middle Mouse Button buried under this infernal, Chroenburgian assembly
115	neg	It feels like trying to command a Two year old into behaving, using only soft verbal warnings, while sliding supine across a frozen lake, while also being used as hockey puck by competing teams of various drunken Canadian bears and moosen
115	neg	This would be an absolutely great mouse to lend to your competition
115	neg	if this was the design intent, hat's off to ya
115	neg	But, to put everything I've said even more viscerally
115	neg	I want to rip the wheel out of the mouse with my teeth and grind it until my gums bleed
115	neg	It's rare that I'm passionate at all about a design feature
115	neg	But this wheel, I HATE IT
115	neg	I want the person who designed it to feel as bad about making it, as I do trying to use it
115	neg	NEVER REVISIT THIS DESIGN EVER AGAIN
115	neg	You just don't get it
115	neg	It literally adds a layer of anxiety and distrust to EVERY SINGLE THING done with this mouse
115	neg	Even the tasks that have nothing to do with scrolling at all
115	neg	The fact that you know this boobytrap is a centimeter from your finger is all it takes
115	neg	Oh yeah
115	neg	AND IT'S LOUD
115	neg	It doesn't even have the common courtesy to make a satisfying noise
115	neg	NO
115	neg	Shifting a from 4th Gear to Reverse at Highway speed in your uncle's rustbucket Camaro is less audibly jarring
115	neg	POSITIVES:The software is actually fairly good
115	neg	With the caveat that you cannot change the Wheel DPI nor the Wheel Up/Down command assignments (wth
115	neg	)
115	neg	The Motion is spot on, but that's baseline expectation for a +$50 MouseAnd the Weight system is a fine option, even if I'm most comfortable taking all the wrights AND THE DOOR off
115	neg	CONCLUSION:The G502, in my humble opinion (at least THIS one I personally received) may as well be eWaste
115	neg	I genuinely tried "Getting Used to It"
115	neg	I gave the thing several months
115	neg	But as a result, I can no longer return it
115	neg	Seriously, Logitech
115	neg	If you would just use the G502's Software, Motion Sensor and Moulded Plastic Quality for the next iteration of the G300s series: I'd buy that day one
115	neg	Give the next G300s a SOLID wheel with a strong ratchet and Side-Pivot lateral scrolling
115	neg	You could even toss in a Thumb Toggle/Switch for DPI shifting or whatever
115	neg	All these things have mechanically solid examples in your other products
115	neg	Paint the dang thing Gold, charge $80, and call it the "G399gg Great Golden Calf Edition"
115	neg	I don't care
115	neg	Just stop with these ridiculously over-designed "srz gam3r" fad features
115	neg	YOU
115	neg	ARE
115	neg	NOT
115	neg	RAZER
115	neg	YOU
115	neg	SHOULD
115	neg	BE
115	neg	BETTER
115	neg	THAN
115	neg	RAZER
115	neg	PS
115	neg	I purchased this mouse via a recommendation from a friend
115	neg	Whom (upon finding out only too late) never uses the mouse wheel, extra buttons or G HUB
115	neg	So yeah, 5-Stars if you just want an overpriced 2-button Mouse
116	pos	Good well made mouse
116	pos	Packaging and shipping was excellent
116	pos	I had to give this mouse away though because it is just too large and uncomfortable for my hand size
116	pos	I also would prefer more buttons
116	pos	Size :I found the back of my hands hurting after using the mouse
116	pos	The "hump" or curve of the mouse seems high, making it a reach for the far left side button (default aim)
116	pos	This means I likely would not use it, bringing the amount of extra buttons down (at least for me)
116	pos	Although, my fingers did seem to automatically find the perfectly located middle back button
116	pos	I never once hit the front middle accidentally
116	pos	Perhaps because one button was too far and just the sheer size of the mouse, i did find that my fingers would sort of expect the four left buttons to be far as well, causing me reach further then they actually were and mis-press
116	pos	To be clear, those four and the middle back buttons are perfectly located so this is just me
116	pos	Buttons:The amount they state does not include the middle front button which serves as the switch for your scroll wheel (either free rolling or click
116	pos	both are great
116	pos	)
116	pos	While I like the option to choose this, I world have prefered having another mappable middle button like my current device
116	pos	Two of the mappable buttons are your scroll wheel left and right tilt
116	pos	This is cool but I felt it would have been better with more noticeable feedback like a soft click
116	pos	The wheel felt almost loose and I am curious if I would have ended up mistakenly clicking to the left or right while trying to just middle click
116	pos	I honestly think I wouldnt and it's just a matter of the user to get used to it
116	pos	Overall, a cool looking and good quality mouse with a few expertly placed buttons
116	pos	Just a bit too large and would have liked more buttons since one of them becomes semi unreachable
117	neg	**Updated review**Amazon replaced the mouse because Logitech was being difficult about honoring their warranty
117	neg	So the 2nd mouse had the same software issue as the original review but I had found a work around for the custom key assignments by using registry edits to let the mouse work with the older software
117	neg	Unfortunately this 2nd mouse has now developed the double click problem that many Logitech mice are prone to because they use cheap micro switches for the clicking mechanism
117	neg	Honestly I'm just going to switch to a different brand that uses better switches even though I've been using Logitech mice for over 20 years
117	neg	**Original review**I upgraded from an old G502 spectrum to this mouse
117	neg	FIrst of all the good things, it's of good quality construction and fits extremely well in my hand
117	neg	It slides fairly smoothly over my mouse pad and overall it's a pleasure to use
117	neg	The bad
117	neg	It is not compatible with Logitech Gaming Software and instead needs to be used with G-HUB in order to customize it's settings
117	neg	G-HUB is
117	neg	not so good
117	neg	G-HUB prevents the left/right wheel click from continuous horizontal scrolling like I could with the G502 Spectrum on LGS
117	neg	(not to be confused with the vertical scroll wheel)I can't assign custom key assignments to the mouse while using onboard-memory mode, it only works when onboard-memory is not turned on
117	neg	You can create a custom profile and then assign it to one of the 5 memory slots, but custom key assignments are for some reason not saved and/or applied
117	neg	What's the point of allowing 5 custom on-the-fly profiles to be assigned if they are not going to let you use custom key assignments
117	neg	It's one of the main features if the mouse that simply won't work because G-HUB doesn't work properly
117	neg	Logitech should enable compatibility with LGS or fix G-HUB
117	neg	Honestly I wish I could just get my money back
118	neg	Here's the bottom line for this mouse
118	neg	It's got average ergonomics, above average buttons and placement, but is spoiled by the terrible Logitech GHub software
118	neg	This mouse doesn't have any onboard memory, which means the Logitech software *has* to be running at all times for you to use anything but the basic functions
118	neg	If it closes on you (which
118	neg	it will), you immediately lose any functions you've set on those extra keys until you reopen the software
118	neg	I use this mouse on both my Mac and PC
118	neg	The interface is poorly designed, and I've yet to have it detect different games when they run on my PC
118	neg	The Mac software has even reset itself a couple times in the 3 weeks I've had it, meaning I have to go back and remap everything, reset the mouse speed, etc
118	neg	Also beware, Little Snitch shows that the G Hub software does phone home to Logitech
118	neg	You can't be sure what it's sending back and forth, especially when you're required to give it full access to your machine for it to function
118	neg	To cap it off, Logitech has *specifically* designed the extra buttons on this mouse so that they cannot be detected by any software other than G Hub
118	neg	Typically you could use an alternative like USB Overdrive or Steermouse on Mac to map buttons, but that's not an option
118	neg	To be clear, that is a deliberate design choice by Logitech to lock you in to their awful software
118	neg	I'd strongly recommend looking elsewhere for a mouse
119	pos	I got this mouse to replace my Razor Naga and my Predator(buttons quit working) for FPS
119	pos	My favorite aspect of the mouse is the adjustable weight
119	pos	i like my mouse to be heavier and i was pleasantly surprised that it came with quite a bit of weight i could add to it and make it the perfect weight
119	pos	The RGB lighting customization for the mouse is great and the software is super easy to use and that's where you can set your custom DPI and use the button on the mouse to quickly switch between the settings
119	pos	The one thing I don't like about the mouse that I've gotten used to is the size, my hand dwarfs this mouse
119	pos	Don't get me wrong its a decent size mouse but i have rather large hands so it was an adjustment but now after about 2 months of using it it feels natural and works great
119	pos	I would recommend this mouse to someone who is looking for a good FPS mouse that wont break the bank
119	pos	Fast forward 9 months the thing quit working
119	pos	Took it apart and the right click switch metal piece had broke and won't work anymore
119	pos	That little metal piece bricked the whole mouse
120	pos	I bought this mouse knowing about the double clicking problems plaguing Logitech mice
120	pos	Whether I come to regret this remains to be seen
120	pos	That said, I purchased the protection plan since everything I have heard about this mouse lead me to believe that it will fail within a few years
120	pos	Design flaws/QC defects aside, I really like this mouse so far
120	pos	It has a bunch of features not present on other mice, like the infinite scroll wheel, left and right scroll buttons on the scroll wheel, programmable profiles, and the button to temporarily change between DPI settings within a profile when held
120	pos	I'm not terribly keen on the shape of the mouse, but I'm getting used to it
120	pos	I don't like the nylon braiding on the wire
120	pos	I liked the cloth braided wires on older mice better
120	pos	Yes, they were prone to kinking over time, but that's just my personal preference in the end
120	pos	The customization software is fairly simple, but some features are easier to adjust than others
120	pos	No documentation on the software in the included instructions, but it's easy to figure out how to use it given a bit of time
120	pos	If it wasn't for the double clicking issues plaguing these mice I would say this is a solid 4
120	pos	5-5 star product, but knowing how widespread they are I'm giving this a 4 star rating instead
120	pos	This review is based on my experience so far
120	pos	If the mouse fails I will return and revise this review along with information on the RMA process
121	neg	EDIT: Beyond the minor difficulties in my original post, the software this comes with doesn't switch profiles when you're playing a game
121	neg	After spending an hour on Reddit trying every suggested fix, none of them have worked - it always reverts instantly to the default "Desktop" profile
121	neg	Really regret buying this mouse, should have stuck with Corsair
121	neg	It's a great mouse, a 5-star mouse, except for how loud the scroll wheel is
121	neg	I can't tell if I got an especially loud one, or if other people just don't notice the noise, or what, because every time I use the scroll wheel it's SO loud that I'm debating whether to keep using this mouse or not
121	neg	Hoping it'll get quieter over time because it really is a great mouse otherwise
121	neg	Just so, so, so very loud
121	neg	(You can switch between regular scroll and hyper scroll, and hyper scroll is totally silent, but it's also far too imprecise for me to use for most things
121	neg	If you're only looking for hyper scroll the noise wouldn't be an issue at all
121	neg	)
122	pos	A fine mouse it is with a lot of very nice settings and profiles that i find to work nicely
122	pos	I do think the sides are a bit slicker than i would prefer and if stickier/grippier might help with the narrowness
122	pos	As a fella with wider hands I find it to be a bit narrow with my pinky and other finger dragging the mat and I find it to be pretty low profile
122	pos	I think if you had smaller hands or likes a thinner and low profile mouse this is perfect
122	pos	If you have bigger hands and want a larger mouse I would look at the Anker precision gaming mouse, I will get another to replace my older one and give this nice mouse to my wife or daughter
122	pos	I like this mouse alot just wish they had an XL version
122	pos	BTW, the mouse wheel does not break it has a button to click rotate or free fly
123	neg	EDIT2 10/23: drifting has become way more noticeable
123	neg	This for MSRP of $80 is ridiculous
123	neg	Usually go Logitech, but it's time to try other miceEDIT: I thought I was going crazy, but my mouse has begun to drift on its own
123	neg	It's been getting worse and worse
123	neg	I don't even use this for gaming really so the durability is questionable
123	neg	I love the G602 and, besides the wireless version of the G502, the G502 wired is the closest thing to the G602
123	neg	The mouse clicks feel nice and sound quiet just like the G602
123	neg	The build quality is great and it doesn't feel cheap
123	neg	However, my biggest complaint about this mouse is that it does not have the same amount programmable buttons the G602 had
123	neg	It's a step backwards from the G602 in this regard and it would be amazing if more buttons were positioned on the left side of the mouse like the G602
124	pos	tl;dr: I have big hands, the mouse is too tapered for my palm grip and is uncomfortable
124	pos	This mouse is better for claw grips
124	pos	It's a cool mouse, but not for me
124	pos	If only the back end was thicccc enough or my palm
124	pos	I have large hands and from a diagram I was researching it was supposed to be one of the more larger sized mice
124	pos	7
124	pos	5" (~19cm) Middle to Base of Palm x 4" (~10cm) across (from the base pinky joint to index joint)
124	pos	I bought this to replace my Razer Death Adder which is far more comfortable
124	pos	I thought the Hero 502 felt narrow
124	pos	Hero 502 measures ~60mm across as the gripping area, but so does the Death Adder
124	pos	I think the problem is attributed to to the narrow tapering base where your palm sits
124	pos	On the 502 Hero, there is only about ~60mm in diameter at the base, but it's tapered so much near the top, there is almost nowhere for your palm to sit on
124	pos	(I like my palm grip when I'm aiming with my arm
124	pos	)
124	pos	In Comparison with the Death Adder at around ~73cm in diameter, my palm sits comfortably
124	pos	I've had a couple Razer products and I want to go try other things now
124	pos	The current DE Chroma, somethings are wearing off/out
124	pos	So it's time for a new mouse
124	pos	Nitpicks: The scroll wheel is more like a flywheel
124	pos	I don't want that much momentum when I flick that wheel around
124	pos	I do like the idea of tilting the wheel, cool feature
124	pos	Another nitpick is Ghub, I'm not familiar with it, but it did take a while for me to set up the DPI
124	pos	And man that was down a couple of rabbit holes
124	pos	I didn't realize GHUB had profiles for each game you had (Which can be a cool thing, but I was hoping the Desktop default was the global set for everything unless you manually change a profile for a game
124	pos	Last nitpick about GHUB, if you have a library of games, you have to keep clicking over this long horizontal list of icons
124	pos	Come on, why can't we set these to tiles of some sort
124	pos	Or just a line by line list of games
124	pos	Or a choice between all three
125	pos	PROS-Cool lights-Fits ergonomically, with adjustable weights-Lots of customizeable buttons
125	pos	For editing, I use a lot of Ctrl functions like Ctrl C, CtrlV, CtrlZ, and CtrlS, so making them each one click streamlines things a great deal
125	pos	CONS- Software is very glitchy and bloated
125	pos	Takes up a lot of memory just to assign a few buttons
125	pos	Sometimes the button assigns just reset to factory after a while
125	pos	Had to reinstall it
125	pos	-The mouse wheel is one of those free-spinning ones that you can either spin like a fidget spinner or lock into a more traditional motion
125	pos	After two months of web-browsing use, the scrolling action no longer registers accurately
125	pos	Clicking with the wheel works, but scrolling up and down has about a 20% success rate
126	neg	My proteus g502 started doing the dreaded double click after a few years so I pulled the trigger on this new "HERO" version of the g502
126	neg	I didn't know it at the time but if you buy a mouse with one of these new "HERO" sensors you will no longer be able to use the sensor/surface calibration that comes with LGS
126	neg	Logitech claims that this new "HERO" sensor does surface calibration on the fly and thus you can no longer manually calibrate it
126	neg	I've been using the mouse for about 24 hours now and its almost completely unusable even for regular web browsing, constant stuttering and deadspots
126	neg	I am using a good quality black neoprene mouse pad with a clean surface
126	neg	My g502 proteus used to do this as well but a quick surface tuning would easily resolve the problem for 6-12 months
126	neg	I found a tip online to uninstall the virtual mouse driver and reboot, this seems to have worked for a few hours but now the problems are back again
126	neg	Don't buy this "HERO" version, get the proteus version if you want a g502 (which is now twice as expensive as this mouse and more expensive than it used to be - gee i wonder why)
127	pos	I've used Logitech Mice for several years now
127	pos	I lost my old Logitech Mouse in my move to another state and I needed a replacement I bought the wireless lightspeed mouse
127	pos	It started having double clicking issues, and I ended up chucking it
127	pos	I decided to go with the standard wired mouse, and I saw the Logitech G502 Gaming mouse with the hero sensor
127	pos	It was cheap so I bought it
127	pos	All I will say is thank goodness it was cheap
127	pos	What I love about the mouse is the number of buttons you have and how it feels
127	pos	I like heavy mice and it comes with adjustable weights
127	pos	I also like how I'm able to customize the mouse to how I play my games with the software
127	pos	Note: I'm using the older Logitech software, not the newer crap they're using now
127	pos	I feel it's just more user-friendly
127	pos	I also like the "Free" mouse scrolling wheel
127	pos	Overall the mouse looks and feels good, and the price was wallet-friendly
127	pos	NOW, we get to the major issue
127	pos	Both this mouse and the light-speed wireless one I have before it ended up having double-clicking issues
127	pos	I've tried cleaning it, adjusting my mouse double-clicking speed, but to no avail
127	pos	I'm so tired of Logitech and how cheap their mice are built
127	pos	It's a crying shame too because I think the mouse is great for gaming, but that stupid double click issue is not being resolved
127	pos	This will probably be the last Logitech Gaming mouse I buy until they do a better job with making them and fixing the double-clicking issue
128	pos	Scroll: 5/10Noise (lack of): 7/10Ease of click: 6/10Speed: 10/10Price/value: 6/10Comfort: 10/10Overall, I would call this an average mouse
128	pos	It's fast, it's comfortable, and it looks nice
128	pos	Only problems
128	pos	Well, there's quite a few
128	pos	The scroll wheel has two settings: free scroll and resistance scroll
128	pos	The free wheel, while quiet, is annoying as all heck - while a great idea, it just doesn't work practically when in a game or document
128	pos	As soon as you let it fly, it literally flies - to Neverland
128	pos	I returned it for a mouse that eventually stops scrolling
128	pos	lol The mechanical resistance scroll is really loud and difficult to move
128	pos	So you basically choose between an uncontrollable infinite scroll or a "stuck" mouse wheel
128	pos	There is no in-between
128	pos	This mouse isn't advertised as "noiseless," so I'll be a little easier on it
128	pos	But it's so loud
128	pos	So damn loud
128	pos	I wanted a mouse that was quieter than my last one, but this one was louder
128	pos	While this mouse has great DPI, it's hard to click and therefore reduces your time to react
128	pos	Would not recommend for an FPS
128	pos	I tried it in Destiny 2, and the thing just was ridiculously slow
128	pos	You basically have to whack it to get it to shoot
128	pos	However, it's a very comfortable mouse
128	pos	The design is high quality and very well made
128	pos	For all its faults, though, I wouldn't pay even the sale price I got it at ($46), much less the regular price ($79)
128	pos	Average mouse, not worth the price
129	pos	This is the second time I've bought this exact mouse
129	pos	My first one lasted about five years, so there's definitely something to be said for durability
129	pos	They don't have a crap ton of buttons like the Razer Naga, but I prefer it that way (it has seven buttons, not including the right/left and wheel)
129	pos	This mouse is insanely ergonomic and feels like it was made for my hand
129	pos	The removable weights are very nice, too (I prefer all of them to be in)
129	pos	It has a very satisfying click and the wheel can either be smooth or lightly clicky
129	pos	You can also adjust your pointer speed directly on the mouse, which I adore
129	pos	The cord is long and has a fabric covering
129	pos	There's a wireless version, but those irritate me
129	pos	It also moves very smoothly on the mousepad and works great with super fast pointer speed
129	pos	Very customizable in the Logitech app, as well
130	pos	The shape and feel of the mouse is nice, and comfortable for people with larger hands
130	pos	The custom button placements are better than the older models and easier to hit
130	pos	The one issue I have is why did you make the scroller button out of Teflon
130	pos	It's seriously the slipperiest roller on any mouse I've ever used; the last one had a nice rubber strip around it
130	pos	Hopefully as it wears it will lose some of this but I may have to disassemble it and buff it up a bit so I can roll it without accidentally clicking all the time
130	pos	You can turn off the clicker so that it's a smooth scroll but that's very sensitive to backwards scrolls so is hard to use in normal situations like web browsing, etc
131	pos	Got this mouse because I can palm a basketball so the 305 felt like a child's toy in my hand
131	pos	A lot of people say this mouse it heavy and I agree, I use it without any weights and it is still twice as heavy as the 305
131	pos	To me, this is fine as I need something heavier or my movements would be uncontrollable
131	pos	Sensor, settings and rbg are all perfect, G-Hub is a great program and lets you set different profiles for each game
131	pos	If you are a bigger or stronger person then I think the weight of the mouse will be fine for you, smaller people might want to look for the ultralights or the 305 series
131	pos	I got this mouse on sale for about $27, I would not pay the full price because you can often find it on sale and at full price I think the g-pro is a better choice
132	pos	I mainly play FPS games and wanted a mouse for the extra buttons that would be advantageous in the heat of the moment
132	pos	At first was very unenthusiastic about the scroll wheel, i would constantly hit the wrong side rather the traditional middle, however after dozens of hours i figured a different use and surprisingly like the scroll wheel feature of being clicked to the left-rightThat being said, as much as i like the mouse for gaming, there are some drawbacks
132	pos	Like the software that i needed to download, very unintuitive, i am in the process of having to open the app everytime i want to game
132	pos	So that the buttons i remapped would register in game
132	pos	thats sorta a hassleThe feel of the mouse is very odd for fps games, ive learned to like it, but its still an odd feeling compared to my old steelseries and redragon ones
132	pos	Overall, good mouse, not great, but good
133	pos	Features include infinite scroll with a switch, programmable buttons on the side, large DPS controls for ADS switching
133	pos	No complaints so far, I prefer all the weights in, as I have larger hands, and having more weight makes it smoother, I don't feel like I'm going to throw the mouse by accident
133	pos	Cable seems to be high quality, With the adjustable DPS and colors, it's fairly customizable as well
133	pos	Some may not like this feature, but when you change your profile to switch the DPS it pops up as an alert, I'm sure it's something you can disable as well, but it tells you the current DPS setting, so its faster than looking at the LEDs on the mouse for reference
133	pos	Great mouse so far
134	pos	Bought this to replace the older version of this mouse
134	pos	My only gripe about these mice is that they're a bit small for my style of mouse use
134	pos	They don't really make big fat mice anymore, so I make do
134	pos	This works great at a good price
134	pos	This mouse is wired, which I prefer, and only has a single place that lights up
134	pos	Logitech typically makes a pretty solid product without getting ridiculous
134	pos	More power to those that like the higher end stuff, I just don't have much need for it
134	pos	Mouse pretty much feels and acts the same
134	pos	Body seems to be the same, just some upgraded components, which is just fine
134	pos	I knew exactly what to expect and got just that and then some
134	pos	Good times
135	neg	I bought this as it was rated good, but was cautious as my other logitech mice and tracballs were really iff as to quality
135	neg	sadly this was worse than the others, within 8 hours of gaming the scroll wheel jad lost it click stops and had shorted the side wheel switches
135	neg	Gaming with it was impossible as if the mouse was moves it set off all the other actions i didn't want, causing me to die consistantly
135	neg	I went from distance to mouse look in the middle of a fight in and out
135	neg	This is useless and I would recommend buying a "Red Dragon" mouse any day of the week, as they are much better quality
135	neg	I have used them and their keyboards for years gaming and have always been satisfied
135	neg	I will also be ignoring some of the you-tubers that recommend this product as they were obviously swayed by the mouse being given to them
135	neg	This mouse is a piece of junk
136	pos	The media could not be loaded
136	pos	Cons:doesn't always automatically select people when opening game
136	pos	This feature Works about 30% of the time
136	pos	-high pricetag for valuePros:-aesthetically pleasing, love the scroll wheel lock/freespin mechanism-feels good in my hand, i wear size large glovesConclusion:Great to look at and very promising features with the macros and button assignment with Logitech software
136	pos	No manual included, only a website address
136	pos	$70
136	pos	00 price is steep
136	pos	I was dissatisfied with the unreliable connection given that the other two wired mouses i have do not experience this issue
136	pos	I would recomend this over the more affordable alternatives out there on amazon only if you are a serious pc gamer
136	pos	The easy to assign buttons are why i wanted this - for fortnite
136	pos	Thank you for reading,Timothy
137	pos	As a girl, I never thought I'd worry about the size of my hands
137	pos	but it's important when choosing a gaming mouse
137	pos	I bought this as a lightning deal for $39
137	pos	So, 40 bucks is a fair price point for this mouse - a separate software download from the internet makes it completely customizable to your liking
137	pos	This is both a pro and con b/c 1) I hate bloatware from an internet download and 2) I can spend hours setting it up when I'd rather be gaming
137	pos	The weights that come with it are nice quality
137	pos	The regular price is somewhere around $60-$70
137	pos	I'd say forget that
137	pos	Pros include weights you can add/subtract, DPI options, and LED lights with option to sync with other Logitech products
137	pos	Cons: Too big for my hand, lack of control b/c of overall size
137	pos	PS I learned after my purchase there is a mid-size version of this mouse
138	neg	When I received the product I was fairly ecstatic about it considering I haven't bought a gaming mouse for quite some time
138	neg	In the first thirty minutes, having to install g hub and configuring the mouse seemed to be a pain in the rear considering that options and changes I've made weren't functioning correctly and did not fully implement itself into the mouse
138	neg	Cases of this were changing the functionality of some buttons on the mouse as provided by the software (g hub) and the dpi of the mouse
138	neg	While these nuances were frustrating and tedious, it did not attract much annoyance and dissatisfaction as it did whenTHE MOUSE WOULD PERIODICALLY STOP FUNCTIONING IN MOVEMENT DESPITE OTHER BUTTONS WORKING AS INTENDEDI'm not sure whether this is a shipment issue that damaged the product, which is unlikely considering the package was pristine, or simply a defective product that was sent to me
138	neg	Either case this should not be an issue when spending $80 on a advertised high quality mouse
138	neg	Honestly disappointing
138	neg	Best part of the mouse was the mouse wheel which I had a lot of fun just spinning
138	neg	The mouse functions and works as best as my 6-8 month old mouse
138	neg	Buy something cheaper
138	neg	Probably won't buy from logitech anymore after this purchase
139	pos	Gaming and working from home these days, and this mouse handles it all
139	pos	For work you can setup several macros to get stuff done (set up two buttons for Cut & Paste for instance
139	pos	Do NOT use it for in game macros
139	pos	You will get booted from most games for cheating, or so I read
139	pos	The keyboard I bought is also a Logitech, and the G Hub software that goes with these devices is excellent
139	pos	LED patterns that go across each in sequence, or separate (up to you)
139	pos	The adjustable mouse sensitivity really helps with aiming in games, and with crossing 3 monitors for work getting done quickly
139	pos	Only issue I have had, and it didn't effect any operation is that the magnetically attached bottom has fallen off a couple of times without me noticing during very intense games
139	pos	I found it jammed up under my keyboard
139	pos	LOLYou can even adjust the weight of the mouse with weights that come with it and fit into the base seamlessly
139	pos	Awesome
139	pos	Gold Standard
140	pos	I read through some of the user reviews and watched some video reviews on this before I purchased
140	pos	I've owned many Logitech high-end gaming mice (and general Logitech mice) in the past
140	pos	When my G700S of old was having double-click issues, I bought a Roccat Nyth
140	pos	The bigger and wider nature of the mouse took a little getting used to (with the wide right-side grip on)
140	pos	I fell in love with the width and generally larger size to fit my larger hands
140	pos	However, it has built up its share of dirt and grime in rather hard to reach places in the years I've owned it
140	pos	The interchangeable and customizable thumb buttons are a very nice feature, except for the fact that the blank covers wobble detracting from the otherwise solid feel of the mouse
140	pos	I figured I'd give Logitech another try bearing in mind the biggest nagging drawback to my old G700S was the wobbly and loud scroll wheel
140	pos	My Nyth has a tactile bumpy scroll wheel that have grown to love a lot and its quiet
140	pos	The G502 Hero's is not quiet and it is still wobbly, just like my old G700S of old
140	pos	In fact the only Logitech gaming mouse from past experience that didn't have a wobbly scroll wheel was the G7
140	pos	The scroll wheel on the Hero is not only wobbly, but the tactile actuation force difference between left tilt and right tilt is significant
140	pos	In that right tilt is so easy to accidentally hit whereas left tilt requires quite a bit more force to actuate
140	pos	This scroll wheel feel has been mostly the same throughout the various mice Logitech has made that have featured a hyperscroll wheel (you click a switch to switch between smooth scrolling and notched scrolling)
140	pos	I guess in the intervening 3 years since I've owned a Logitech gaming mouse, this has not changed
140	pos	Their mouse wheel is still the same wobbly protrusion
140	pos	Sadly, the scroll wheel tactility and overall polish (or lack thereof) is enough for me to decide to return it after only just picking this up from the Amazon locker only an hour ago
140	pos	Well that and the lack of any additional grips, though I won't hold the grip against it
140	pos	The Nyth's interchangeable grips are featured in very few mice
140	pos	For the $75 that this mouse was, I feel the mouse wheel could have been improved considering that they've had this mouse wheel hyperscroll feature for nearly 10 years now
140	pos	Going to give the Roccat Leadr a try considering how much i like my Nyth
140	pos	If only the Nyth came in a wireless variant with more solid (less wobbly thumb buttons and covers/spacers)
140	pos	TLDR: -2 stars for wobbling scroll wheel
140	pos	Right tilt too easy to trigger
140	pos	Wheel scrolling in notched mode is very loud, as loud as my Kaihl brown keyboard switches
141	pos	Pros:- Onboard memory (can pretty much carry my settings over to my work PC)- Customizable DPI, lighting, and buttons- Multiple profiles (configs you can cycle through)- Spinning scroll wheel with toggle button- Easily accessible DPI switch on the side (great for FPS games)Cons:- Noticeably small if you have large hands
141	pos	If you're wondering, it is smaller than the Logitech MX mice (which I like for their size)
141	pos	My measurements (finger tip to palm x palm including thumb): 7" x 4"- G-Hub: I could rant about this but I'll keep it brief
141	pos	Although I haven't had any of the horrible experiences I've had in the past with using G-Hub for their headsets where the drivers and G-Hub itself would break with every update, however you absolutely need it to use %100 of the mouse features
141	pos	G-Hub has a subreddit if you want to get an idea of how many products experience breakage with each update (automatic updates can be disabled though)
141	pos	- Spin wheel toggle is kind of hard to click into place compared to the MX mice
141	pos	- Buttons feel kind of cheap
142	pos	When I first had seen this mouse - and the special edition version which is uglier and $15 cheaper right now - I thought it looked extra and ridiculous between the multicolor LED and the weird design and the thumb-rest wing type thing on the side
142	pos	I literally ONLY bought this because the multi-tilt scroll-wheel on my G500S was broken and the mouse was 3 years old so I believe out of warranty
142	pos	That said, it's been smooth as butter from the beginning
142	pos	It does require a newer version of the LGS than older peripherals did, but installing it didn't mess up my G933 or G810 profiles at all - something you should expect but these days you can't
142	pos	The mouse has good weight without the custom weights - which like all Logitech gaming mice come in their own separate case and can be mixed and matched
142	pos	Unlike the MX517, G500, and other previous lines, there is no weight tray - it's built in to the bottom of the mouse
142	pos	Just life the panel on the bottom
142	pos	I personally am not using them
142	pos	This unit definitely has the precision, out of the box, for Photoshop work as well
142	pos	Gaming I honestly haven't noticed a huge improvement but it has stayed the same, and that's all I needed
142	pos	The scroll wheel has the same two modes as the G500 - theres a loud clicky mode with more traction, and a quiet smoother mode for faster scrolling
142	pos	As with other Logitech gaming products, you can turn the LED off completely, or sync it with the LEDs from your other devices
142	pos	I love it and it was on sale for maybe $50 or so, to be honest I don't remember the price because it was low
143	pos	My Proteus crapped out on me after 4 years of excellent service, so I grabbed this to replace it
143	pos	It has the exact same feel as the Proteus
143	pos	Its still heavy, you won't be walking into any FPS league championships with it
143	pos	But you can stay competitive
143	pos	I don't know why they still bother with the weights, like it needs to be any heavier
143	pos	Other games won't be hindered by the weight
143	pos	The base weight cover has a black lip unlike the Proteus's teal lip, but you can use the base cover from the Proteus  on the Hero, transferring that blue aesthetic
143	pos	So you can make this look nearly identical to the Proteus
143	pos	I didn't think I'd care for the RGB as It tends to be dimmer than static lighting and I only want blue, but turns out I can make a better blue from it
143	pos	The Proteus has a lot of green to its blue light, and its actually brighter
143	pos	I really haven't noticed a difference with the improved sensor, I guess I'm just not pro enough to notice
143	pos	It feels exactly like the Proteus, exactly what I wanted
144	neg	I was extremely happy with this mouse for the first couple of months that I had it, until I began noticing an issue with the primary mouse button registering single clicks as two near-instantaneous clicks
144	neg	For anyone who enjoys gaming, they can probably infer that this is a horrible issue
144	neg	For example, if you're using a grappling hook that requires one click, and you're high up risking fall damage
144	neg	Guess what
144	neg	Your grapple hook just went out because your mouse registered two clicks instead of one, and now the cooldown is causing you to fall to your death
144	neg	This isn't an uncommon issue either, and logitech is very well; however, their upper management has put policies in place to make it unreasonably prohibitive to acquire a replacement mouse
144	neg	By the time I was done sending in all of the screenshots of click-register testing, pictures of the mouse and serial numbers, I gave up because I had other things going on in my life to the point where I'd probably pay $40 just to tell Logitech to shove the mouse up a place where no light can be shone
144	neg	From what the Logitech rep told me, the switch issue that is present (and has been present for 1-2+ years) is prevalent in many mouse manufacturers
144	neg	Strange how they haven't implemented a fix yet, though
144	neg	OR offered a better warranty/replacement program that is a *little* bit more accessible
145	neg	Going on 45 days now, 14 emails, a tracking number where nothing has shipped and multiple attempts to resolve a warranty claim, as usual, Logitech simply ignores you as user once they run of excuses in their agent script-book
145	neg	I've been through this twice before with Logitech, so no, this isn't related to our current "unprecedented times" as  both times before I thought this was a fluke - it's not
145	neg	This is Logitech's way of defrauding users out of their warranty, which is to keep dragging things out as long as possible while continuing to make promises with no intention of actually delivering on those promises let alone shipping a warranty replacement
145	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again
146	pos	I bought this on sale and I'll buy Logitech over the flashy garbage that Razer puts out for gamers any day
146	pos	I decided to move on from the Corsair mouse I liked after I went through two in 4 years
146	pos	When a mouse is ~$100 it shouldn't break from moderate use
146	pos	I was looking for something that felt nice and I could stand it breaking in the next two years
146	pos	This feels nice
146	pos	The weight adjustment is a nice feature, and the handful of programmable buttons is great
146	pos	I use various macros or prefer to have some oft-used keys on in reach of my thumb quite a bit
146	pos	The G Hub software is easy to use, so getting all set up the way I wanted took less than 20 minutes
146	pos	After I read another review after thinking the scroll wheel just sucked, I was very satisfied
146	pos	I initially thought there was no tactile feedback to the wheel, but there was a button for it
146	pos	It must have come in one position, or I accidentally hit it, but once I clicked it everything felt great
146	pos	My only other issue is I keep accidentally pushing the DPI shift button at the tip of my thumb consistently
146	pos	I can get used to it and adjust, but it's enough to prevent a full five stars
147	pos	The first thing that I thought when I first used the mouse is it's narrow profile, which is much too narrow for the average man's hands, leaving your pinky and ring finger dragging on the desk or struggling to find room to grip the mouse
147	pos	The RGB LEDs are not all that impressive because only two parts of the mouse light up
147	pos	Most of the buttons are easily accessible without much finger travel though they really missed an opportunity to put buttons on the right side for increased ergonomics
147	pos	The plastic and rubber feel cheap in the palm and what disappoints me the most is the use of rubber in parts of the mouse because the oils on your hand will eventually degrade it (this happened to my other logitech mouse
147	pos	) Another quirk: this mouse is strongly magnetic at the bottom which causes it to stick somewhat to my stainless steel desk
147	pos	This isn't a deal breaker for me because now I don't need to use the weights for added resistance but its still not something you'd expect
147	pos	Negatives aside the mouse works as expected but for the overall build quality I would say it needs to be set at a lower price
148	neg	As a Logitech User I was already satisfied with the G502 Proteus Core though of course over the years the wiring's mesh has frayed so I thought to get a new one and seeing the Hero as only a minor upgrade at a fair price than my original purchase I proceeded to grab it
148	neg	It feels great, nostalgic for Proteus Core users and of course with the extra DPI range can make gaming rather engaging albeit a little bit
148	neg	For the time being, I enjoy it and would be open to see what else Logitech would do to top it off
148	neg	UPDATE: So a notable error has occurred that I felt should be brought up to which I have not found a "reliable" solution to yet
148	neg	In short, over the past couple months I've noticed an odd increase in input from the mouse (sudden multi-clicks) when I was playing Osu
148	neg	(Rhythm Game I occasionally play) as the ripple indicator as well my Mouse Key Input Tab was registering more hits than usual, even when Click+Dragging for the game
148	neg	Before this, I was having some similar issues while playing games on my emulator where my click and drag would reset and interrupt the gameplay
148	neg	The notable bit is the pressure put on the mouse whether it be lightly pressed or firmly pressed and even after testing the hardware with a click test it now registers that every 10/100 Clicks a double input would occur if pressed lightly though when "mashing" the results increase (20-24/100 Clicks) which has me puzzled at what needed to be done
148	neg	Overall, the mouse is "usable" though for high intensity applications that require precision and such I would not recommend grabbing this mouse as its lifespan was barely over a year and not at all satisfactory for the consumer
148	neg	UPDATE: So I attempted to rectify the issue again though after some more time had passed, there is a notable hardware issue with this mouse where your "left" clicks registers multiple times with it's sensitive clicking which is a hinderance to "active" games like Osu
148	neg	which require precise clicks and dragging at high speeds
148	neg	Even playing on emulators is stifling to do where you have to resort to registering your main clicks with the "right" button instead of the usual left button
148	neg	DO NOT PURCHASE THISUnless you're willing to adapt to its faults
149	pos	The media could not be loaded
149	pos	So far the 502 is living up to the high logitech standards I'm used to
149	pos	I needed a replacement for my old G402, the left button switch was randomly double clicking on single press
149	pos	The 402 lasted me a few years and I was sad to see it go
149	pos	Just like the 402, the 502 Hero is good for people with larger hands
149	pos	It's slightly smaller as you can see in my pics, but hardly noticeable
149	pos	The buttons schemes are almost identical which made the transition to the 502 seamless
149	pos	The shape of the mouse is comfortable and easy to get used to
149	pos	The thumbrest is large which may take up some real estate, so beware of you have limited space
149	pos	One thing I'm a little apprehensive about is the scroll wheel
149	pos	It rattles around and seems to shake the entire mouse when scrolling in regular mode, not hyperfast mode (free spin)
149	pos	Also the left and right wheel tilt buttons have too much play
149	pos	This may or may not be a problem in the future but I didn't take a star away because it's only slightly annoying
149	pos	I'll update if it gets worse
149	pos	The feet seem good it glides across my mousepad with ease
149	pos	There is slightly more friction than my old 402, but that may just be because it's not broken in yet
149	pos	All in all it seems like a good buy, but if you get it on sale then it's almost a MUST buy
149	pos	There are enough features for the hard core gamer and it's easy and comfortable enough to use for the average gamer
150	neg	Be aware that the double click issue may not be the hardware, other words the internal micro switch
150	neg	The driver, that G Hub software (Logitech Gaming) is way over-bloated for what it does, and can cause all kinds of system problems because it tries to be Jack of all trades to act as a driver for other Logitech peripherals also and the installed software size is massive, over 300 Mbs
150	neg	So, what I do is use the G Hub for button assignments making sure the setting are saved in the on board (mouse) memory, and immediately uninstall G Hub
150	neg	The rest of the fine tuning can be done in the Windows muse settings, including setting the double-click timing to the longest possible
150	neg	Your mileage may vary, but the accidental double-click errors are very frustrating with this otherwise very nice mouse
151	pos	Upgraded to this from a G500s
151	pos	I wasn’t sure if I’d like the DPI shift button or not, and figured I’d just re-bind it to another function, but I actually like it
151	pos	I wish this had one more thumb button, as I tend to bind this to the “inventory” of the games I play
151	pos	The cable is super flexible, so it doesn’t “spring” the mouse when you let go of it, like my old mouse occasionally did
151	pos	The mouse works with G Hub for programming macros and such, which is miles ahead of the Logitech gaming software in terms of creating macros and other keybinds
151	pos	The mouse has a decent weight to it without using the supplied weights, but that’s personal preference
151	pos	The mode wheel is a little too stiff for my liking, it really ka-chunk ka-chunks into the detents
151	pos	I have rather large hands and it fits nice in my hand
151	pos	All of the buttons are reachable for me
152	neg	Bought this mouse in hopes to use it and program it for gaming
152	neg	Turns out the onboard memory cannot be programmed for macros or most other useful functions
152	neg	These functions are only available if you have G Hub open at ALL TIMES, which is very annoying
152	neg	This means if you do not have G Hub installed on any of the devices you plan on using this with, it will only do the basic functions of a mouse
152	neg	I tried calling support only to find myself talking to someone who barely spoke English, and he couldn’t give me a good answer on why I can’t program a macro onto my mouse
152	neg	I would recommend going with something else like a Red Dragon gaming mouse, which can do all of these functions with the onboard memory for way less of the cost
152	neg	Unless Logitech is able to fix this with an update, I would not recommend this mouse to anyone
152	neg	Buyer beware
153	neg	Low quality materials
153	neg	The wheel barely lasted a month and is now a weighted fly wheel
153	neg	It's too easy to press the extra buttons near your thumb and mapping them is not intuitive
153	neg	So you end up just unintentionally increasing the DPI setting to ridiculously high settings forcing you to somehow open the utility to fix it
153	neg	Yeah, the software sucks too
153	neg	The only thing decent about this is the magnetic bottom
154	neg	This mouse is super comfortable and fit my hand very well
154	neg	Problem is the main right button was very finicky
154	neg	I need to right click and hold the button for my games to aim and it the mouse would act like I wasn't holding the button down
154	neg	I'd click and hold and it would act like I just clicked sometimes id have to click and hold 2,3,4,5 times before it would work right and let me aim
154	neg	I tried to contact logitech but they can't be bothered to answer the phone or get back to an email
154	neg	The only fix I could find was to pull the button up gently and then press it back down hard and that fixed it for a while
154	neg	But it started doing it again a few weeks later and while trying to fix it myself again it finally broke
154	neg	Definitely not happy with it and even less pleased with logitechs lack of customer service
154	neg	Definitely won't be buying any more of their products
155	neg	I've purchased Logitech products since the 90s and have been an avid game, and they are always known for having top quality egonomics
155	neg	The g502 does not meet my expectations in for a daily use nor gaming mouse
155	neg	I have small hands, and this mouse is actually too small for my palm that i'm actually squeezing my fingers to grip the mouse--this will be an even bigger issue for larger hands
155	neg	Secondly, they sacrificed comfort and ergonomics and tried to make it look futuristic and stylish
155	neg	They put an a steeper incline at the index finger, which is not the correct shape for your hands
155	neg	Also the scroll wheel on free mode is unusable, and on click mode is very clunky and inaccurate
155	neg	It's a very cheap and inaccurate wheel to control, and their gaming software gives no options to change this
155	neg	If you don't mind wireless options I would recommend looking at either the g602 or g604
156	pos	Update: My prior Chinese manufactured G502 Hero died on me after I dropped it a few too many times
156	pos	Took about a year and several drops from standard table height
156	pos	If you are boycotting China products, then you'll be happy to know that the G502 is now being manufactured in Malaysia
156	pos	Update: The entire process took about 14 days, but I did receive a replacement mouse under the two-year warranty for the item
156	pos	I am not sure what happened to my prior mouse; it could have been used as I didn't inspect it closely for fingerprint smudges or tampering
156	pos	Make sure that you do your due diligence regarding that inspection
156	pos	Ultimately, Logitech did the right thing and sent me a new mouse under the warranty program
156	pos	Other than the failure of the prior G502 Mouse I had purchased, this mouse is the best I have used to this date
156	pos	I hope it doesn't spontaneously burn out after the warranty period ends
156	pos	This mouse was fantastic
156	pos	The key word is: was
156	pos	After owning this mouse for a total of two months, it is no longer fantastic
156	pos	The mouse died on me without explanation
156	pos	There is no conceivable reason for it having done so
156	pos	It just suddenly connected and disconnected to my PC randomly before refusing to connect or power on ever again
156	pos	I tried multiple USB ports
156	pos	I tried everything
156	pos	Other mouses work
156	pos	This one does not work anymore
156	pos	And, unfortunately, it died before I could return it
156	pos	Here is a description of exactly what happened and my diagnostic attempts to correct the problem: "The mouse suddenly and inexplicably began intermittently turning on and off disconnecting and reconnecting from my PC
156	pos	The lights on the mouse were erratic and not working properly
156	pos	The mouse connected for a few minutes but the laser tracker was not functioning on the bottom of the mouse
156	pos	It would not work
156	pos	I tried all the USB ports
156	pos	None worked for the mouse
156	pos	I tried a new mouse
156	pos	The new mouse worked perfectly fine in the same USB ports
156	pos	The problem was with the G502 Hero mouse that suddenly died after I unplugged it the first time to try another port
156	pos	It never turned on again and remained disconnected
156	pos	Something short-circuited inside the mouse; it is a hardware issue
156	pos	"I will update this review should Logitech do the right thing and make good on their warranty
157	pos	After the LMB switch broke in my old G602 (which is the second time this has happened to me with Logitech mice), I decided to try a wired one
157	pos	The good: the mouse fits my hand quite well, and it glides very nicely
157	pos	The bad: the mouse buttons take almost no effort to click - maybe half the effort compared to G602, so I end up clicking both buttons instead of one pretty often
157	pos	Also, although I like being able to switch between the clicky and smooth motion of the wheel, the clicky mode is too loud, much louder than G602
157	pos	Finally, the back / forward side buttons are hard for me to tell apart by touch, and I have to shift the hand to reach the back one, which is not great as I use them in games
157	pos	Bottom line, I am returning this one and will look for something that fits my needs better
158	pos	I was using a Wireless G700
158	pos	It was a great mouse
158	pos	It was a getting a little laggy for me and i decided to upgrade
158	pos	There is a wireless version of the G502 but it cost a lot more
158	pos	The fact was that i left my G700 wired up most of the time
158	pos	So i bought the G502
158	pos	It is fantastik
158	pos	It is very responsive
158	pos	I liked the 4 button layout on the G700 on the left side
158	pos	That was my one reservation versus really only 3 on the G502
158	pos	I love the left thumb button on the G502 which the G700 did not have
158	pos	I do not know why they could not have kept the 4 buttons on the G700 and just added the thumb button on the G502
158	pos	I find the that i do not use the G6 and G7 buttons much yet
158	pos	Maybe i will in the future when i get used to this more
158	pos	It took me a little time to get used to the new software but it is ok
158	pos	It is a great mouse

159	pos	T
159	pos	finally of several years out of warranty is finally breaking down
159	pos	Missing a foot, right button barely registers the click
159	pos	So, after digging through a whole bunch of sites about best mice - I found this mouse to be most consistently rated among several reviewers
159	pos	It's a little smaller than the old one, but fits my hand better, even though I have big hands
159	pos	I love the feel of the body, Very smooth
159	pos	The response of the mouse is fantastic, but I still am learning what setting to use
159	pos	Also getting use to the wheel, definitely a different feel from the old one
159	pos	Over-all I believe this was a good buy - I actually got this here at a really good discount
159	pos	I've used Logitech in the past - rollerballs, and my very old flight stick so I know quality is there
159	pos	I recommend this for the casual gamer - I have to try it with a FPS soon
160	pos	The first mouse that was shipped to me had a loose scroll wheel (a common problem, apparently) that was overly sensitive to left scroll clicks to the point where I couldn’t use the middle mouse button without accidentally pressing the left scroll button accidentally much of the time
160	pos	Amazon replaced the mouse and amazingly had the replacement at my door within hours
160	pos	The replacement’s scroll wheel is noticeably better, but then I noticed another defect on the first mouse that didn’t catch my attention initially
160	pos	The replacement mouse has four pads/feet on the bottom, whereas the initial mouse only has three—it’s missing the thin pad right below the G502 Hero logo
160	pos	But here’s the kicker: the pad on the replacement mouse was misaligned and sticking up at its smallest point
160	pos	I was easily able to pull it off and glue it into its proper place, but now the lack of replacement pads—which should come standard with mice in this price range—worries me
160	pos	The G502 Hero is a great mouse design, but unfortunately I’m not convinced it’ll last very long
161	neg	I have been through 3 of these G502 mice in the last year and a half
161	neg	All of them suffer from defective clickers
161	neg	The left and right mouse buttons will often extra click, when you only want to click once
161	neg	Or if you hold down the button it thinks you only wanted to click it once
161	neg	Claiming a warranty on the mice is a terrible process and takes months, and only after their support makes you jump through 100 troubleshooting steps, and require you to video record you destroying the mice
161	neg	This is such a common problem for G502's that it has turned into a JOKE
161	neg	Logitech should be ashamed of their disgusting product reliability
161	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again, I am moving over to Corsair for everything
161	neg	Stay away from Logitech products, you have been warned
162	neg	This was a replacement for an older Logitech wireless gaming mouse that's no longer available
162	neg	I have been buying Logitech products since the company started in the 1980s and have owned many Logitech mice
162	neg	I purchased this in October of 2019 as an upgrade to an older Logitech G700 which is no longer available
162	neg	I initially liked the mouse
162	neg	It has good set of features and I liked the overall design, however after a couple of months I began to have problems with intermittent operation of the right mouse button
162	neg	At times, when I held down the button it would send random click up and down events
162	neg	If I pressed harder they would often stop so it was obvious that the switch was malfunctioning
162	neg	I contacted Logitech and after troubleshooting the problem they sent me a replacement mouse
162	neg	Over the last couple of weeks the replacement has begun to exhibit the same problem
162	neg	A quick internet search reveals that this seems to have been a common problem with this model since its release which Logitech has not fixed despite a large number of complaints
162	neg	At this point it seems like a waste of time to request another replacement since it seems like;y that it too will fail
162	neg	I will think twice before purchasing another Logitech product in the future
163	neg	I wanted to replace my Corsair M65 after the left button sometimes does not work
163	neg	I've only used Corsair for about 10 years now and I remember Logitech being a decent company for gaming peripherals
163	neg	oh how the mighty have fallen
163	neg	It's extremely cheap plastic, I feel like this thing is going to break in my hands, I found myself treating it like a priceless artifact
163	neg	The buttons move around and feel and sound so cheap, just that typical cheap plastic sound you get from toys at the Dollar Store
163	neg	The weights don't fit well inside the mouse, I picked up the mouse to move it and the cheap bottom feel out as well as two weights
163	neg	I'd had enough of this mouse after a night's worth of gaming when the adhesive at the top used to promote frictionless movement started to peel off and scratch my mouse pad
163	neg	I immediately had enough, packaged it back up the way it came and started the refund process
163	neg	Corsair, if you're reading this, please please please just fix the left click issue and you still have the best gaming mouse on the market
163	neg	Logitech
163	neg	I'm speechless, I'm not sure how this could be one of the most sold gaming mice on the market
163	neg	With that much money you should be able to engineer a solid product
163	neg	I won't be going back to this company
164	pos	So I've had this mouse for I think just a little over a year and the mouse buttons are already dying
164	pos	I'll be holding the buttons down but inside of a game it'll be registering that I'm not, off and on
164	pos	I swapped to a backup mouse and the issue went away
164	pos	Example, FFXIV -> Pressing both the left and right buttons would 'stutter step' walk, and holding the right-button down to move the camera would stop/start randomly like I stopped holding the button down
164	pos	Doesn't matter how hard I held the button down either
164	pos	It was fantastic while it worked, but I have to dock two stars for not even lasting 2 years
165	pos	Right mouse button randomly sticks or feels like a "short throw" and doesn't fully engage
165	pos	It's damn frustrating for a mouse that costs this much
165	pos	Otherwise, it's a great mouse, comfortable, buttons 4 & 5 conveniently located
165	pos	The "shift" button doesn't get much use, it's rather awkward and nearly pointless
165	pos	The software is OK, but with one game it randomly swaps back and forth between Mouse-4/Mouse-5 and R/T
165	pos	leading to too many unnecessary deaths
165	pos	Overall, because of the expense and the failing mouse button, buy something else
165	pos	Logitech, you've lost another loyal, disappointed customer
166	pos	Day 1 review, so just my initial impressions
166	pos	Pluses: Build quality, weight, button feel are all on point
166	pos	Tracking seems accurate
166	pos	Meh:  It's narrow, not great if you have larger hands (fine if not)
166	pos	Weight is almost too much, even without the (seemingly) unnecessary extra weights (included) that you can install
166	pos	The 'thumb rest' (for right handed people anyway) is weird, though I think with more use it will be fine, maybe even a nice plus
166	pos	Misses:  The mouse wheel
166	pos	It almost feels like an afterthought
166	pos	It's a solid plastic piece, with larger dips that probably double as grip texture and the mechanism to create the stops or 'speed bumps' when you scroll the wheel
166	pos	It has no other texture, isn't rubberized or textured in a way that helps prevent slippage
166	pos	It feels too smooth
166	pos	Couple that with the clunky 'speed bump' mechanism and it makes accurately scrolling the wheel difficult at best
166	pos	Definitely not a high performance feature, and honestly it doesn't work particularly well for normal use
166	pos	Not sure yet if it's a game-breaker, but it's at best a serious oversight
166	pos	I'd love to love this, especially at the price point, but the wheel is such a constant issue that I'm not certain if it's something I can get past
167	pos	good mouse and has what most people need
167	pos	but its not all that great in the hands, my pinkie finger is pushed into a odd place that i dont care much forthe 2 programable buttons on the corner are not useable without taking youre hands off the mousethe metal scroll wheel has more noise then i would care for
167	pos	and the metal ring makes the wheel free spin
167	pos	the scroll wheel also feels chunky
167	pos	not for methe mouse also seems to have some heft to it without the weights installedand it feels cheep overallthe razer deathadder is a overall better mouse if you are looking for somthing  that feels great in the hand
167	pos	mine broke after 3 years but i can see why people put up with it
168	pos	I bought this mostly for FPS games
168	pos	I have to say, it's one of the most ergonomic peripherals I've used, very comfortable
168	pos	The DPI on the fly button is something I'm used to and consider necessary
168	pos	It's pretty good
168	pos	Left and right click are standard, not to tight, not too loose
168	pos	The scroll wheel feels way too loose, regardless of whether the clicker is on or off
168	pos	I am CONSTANTLY hitting the back button and navigating away from whatever page I'm on while browsing
168	pos	I don't really see the use of some of these extra buttons just because it may be awkward to use reliably when they're all on a hair trigger
168	pos	For the price, it's a great mouse and feels really solid
168	pos	That accidental "back" click is my primary annoyance, and I rarely use a scroll wheel outside of browsing online anyway
168	pos	Also appreciate that it only has one small light that will be covered by your hand while in use, and it doesn't shoot out some crazy lazer every time I pick it up
169	neg	I bought this mouse because a few reviews indicated it was both a quality product and comfortable for people with big hands
169	neg	While the former is true, the latter is only partially true
169	neg	I wouldn't call it uncomfortable, but there's something about the angle your hand rests that makes certain actions a little awkward, at least for big hands
169	neg	Trying to mash m1 quickly, for instance, is harder than previous mouses I've owned because pressing down on a slant causes horizontal movement, however slightly
169	neg	It's mitigated somewhat by the curvature of the mouse 1 button, but it's still present
169	neg	Another problem I have is that the DPI adjustment buttons are constantly being pressed by accident, one way or the other
169	neg	There might be a way to lock those down, but that complicates the accessibility of variable DPI, so it's one or the other
169	neg	The G Hub software is bloated and generally unpleasant to use, but required for full functionality
169	neg	After owning the mouse for about six months, the notorious g502 left-click issues began
169	neg	It was spotty for a little while, but now it can't hold a click at all, making it essentially unusable
169	neg	Overall, the mouse looks nice and feels pretty good, but the invasive software and the shoddy craftsmanship on the switches make it not worth the money
170	pos	It's a great mouse, it kills me that the scroll wheel sucks so much
170	pos	It's accurate, the weights system is great, the clicking feels awesome, it has a lot of customizable buttons, all in all it's pretty awesome
170	pos	The scroll wheel is hot garbage
170	pos	It's made of metal, which everyone here seems to love, great, I don't have a problem with that part
170	pos	First issues is that it's SUPER hard to scroll with it, scrolling takes a lot more finger strength than on a regular mouse and that's bad enough, you can turn off the click scrolling for smooth but then you have the problem that it's way too lose
170	pos	The biggest issue I have with it is how insanely sensitive the mouse is when it comes to left and right click on the wheel button
170	pos	This is one of the features I buy mice for because I use it all the time in games and for browsing, but it's INCREDIBLY sensitive on this mouse, I'm constantly click the left click on the scroll wheel when I'm just scrolling and a big part of it is that you have too apply so much strength to the scrolling that it makes you accidentally click all the time
170	pos	I can unbind the left click to avoid this problem, but why would I
170	pos	I literally bought the mouse for that feature
171	pos	I have a medium-sized hand
171	pos	Six and a half inches across
171	pos	Weight and SizeThe G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available
171	pos	However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it
171	pos	In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse
171	pos	This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features
171	pos	The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all
171	pos	The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed
171	pos	I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters
171	pos	Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse
171	pos	With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better
171	pos	I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)ProsRubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnetThe cable is built like a tank
171	pos	No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk
171	pos	The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant
171	pos	The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same
171	pos	Mouse clicks are very light and responsiveThe number of buttons makes it a productivity machineThumbrest is supportiveThe sensor is completely flawless, no odd trackingYou can flex on friends
171	pos	Anymore to be said
171	pos	ConsRGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand
171	pos	When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harshWhen shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattleThe mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dustWhile the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy
171	pos	It also gets in the way sometimes
171	pos	DPI button could be shifted back littleThe optional weights are almost completely uselessPerformanceThe mouse was great to game with, but not perfect
171	pos	The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well
171	pos	The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions
171	pos	The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons
171	pos	The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate
171	pos	However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse)
171	pos	I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse
171	pos	This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse
171	pos	Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons
171	pos	I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form
171	pos	FINAL VERDiCTDon't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it
171	pos	For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse
171	pos	Your experience will be much better
171	pos	But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out
171	pos	Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return
172	pos	I've been using a G702 for many years now, and the switches were starting to go, so it was time to upgrade
172	pos	Well, seeing reviews and knowing some people using this I decided to get it, so I got it and I can say that it's nice, but I like the G702 a lot better
172	pos	Before I go too far, most negatives are about double-clicking, I have not experienced that nor has my friend that is also running this mouse
172	pos	So far, I really do like this mouse, but I do have a few minor grips, and this is what seems to be just on the one I got and not on all
172	pos	But, the textured covering over the weights is dragging on the mouse pad, which means that the skatez on this mouse are too short
172	pos	It's an easy fix to just go out and buy new skatez, but, for a new product, I shouldn't have to yet
172	pos	** (Update, put on new skatez over the ones that came on there and it no longer drags
172	pos	)
172	pos	**Other things I am not a fan of is this mouse is good for smaller hands, I feel
172	pos	Also, the definition between the buttons are not very defined, and I feel you can easily click the wrong button
172	pos	If the mouse was a little wider, I think it would be a bit more comfortable
172	pos	This also may be because I am not use to it yet, but a little bump or something on the buttons along with being a little wider, those two small touches, I feel this could have been a better mouse
173	pos	Overall I'm happy with this mouse
173	pos	It connected easily enough and has a good amount of configurations available with the Logitech software
173	pos	Weights are easy enough to add with a magnetic closure plate to make it sleek
173	pos	Myonly complaint would be for the DPI
173	pos	The two buttons next to the left mouse click, are reserved for on the fly DPI adjustment
173	pos	You can either use them for that or disable them, they are not programmable
173	pos	Why
173	pos	Yes on the fly DPI adjustment is important for some, but why not make them programmable
173	pos	And, why are they so big
173	pos	For DPI adjustments two smaller buttons would have been fine
173	pos	Lastly, these buttons don't have a distinctive feel difference between the two or a separation that you can feel
173	pos	Each time I adjust, I have to look at the mouse
174	pos	This mouse was great the soon I got it
174	pos	3 or 4 months pass, no issue
174	pos	6 months, that's when it appears, the double-clicking
174	pos	And it doesn't seem that I'm the one who keeps getting issues, it's a flaw in the construction
174	pos	It's especially frustrating when trying to work and be productive because the double click causes a lot of issues with editing work or creating assignments
174	pos	And when you're gaming, you're at a major disadvantage because it double clicks more in games than in general use
174	pos	I play fps games most of the time (for example rainbow six siege) and when I try to shoot it stops shooting, it doesn't go full auto, Also for general use, when watching youtube whenever you want to pause it will sometimes put you in fullscreen
174	pos	If you are looking for a similar product to the G502 hero, you're better of with the G502
174	pos	Although the quality of the G502 isn't as superior as this, it at least is a functioning mouse
175	neg	Pros:- Looks cool- Compatible with the same lighting software I already use with my Logitech keyboard- Feels pretty solid/well constructed- I like that I can adjust the weightCons:- Only one, but it's a pretty big one for me: I think this is just me and the way I grip/rest my hand on the mouse, but I am unintentionally left and right clicking ALL THE TIME when I use this mouse
175	neg	It's especially annoying if I'm playing an FPS game or something where left clicking will fire the gun or toss the grenade I'm currently holding, in a game that has friendly fire
175	neg	yeah
175	neg	It feels like the left/right click buttons on this mouse are a lot longer than they were on the G5 (pretty much anywhere above the big letter "G" on the mouse will left/right click)
175	neg	I've been dealing with it and just trying to make a conscious effort to keep my hand off the mouse as much as possible, but I'm probably going to shop around for a different mouse and maybe give this one to a friend or something
175	neg	My old mouse that this one replaced was a Logitech G5 that I'd been using for over a decade, and I never had this problem with it
175	neg	Again, I think it's probably a great mouse, and it's just me and the way I grip the mouse (especially hard to adjust when I'd been using the same G5 for over a decade, I guess), but that problem is making the mouse borderline unusable for me
176	pos	I bought a G502 years ago, when the line first launched, and I loved it
176	pos	I used it for hours each day for those years, and I never regretted that purchase
176	pos	However, a few weeks ago the left mouse button started double clicking
176	pos	I tried it with different computers and reset the settings on the mouse but nothing fixed it
176	pos	It seems the switch is dying
176	pos	I considered repairing it (and I still might), but the cost of parts is about 1/3 of a new mouse and I would also need something more advanced than the Radio Shack soldering iron I have somewhere in a drawer
176	pos	So I bought the new G502 Hero
176	pos	It is every bit as good as the original
176	pos	In fact, they are practically the same mouse from the outside
176	pos	The blue accents are gone from the original, and the logo is different, but otherwise they are identical
176	pos	Of course, the sensor on the Hero is different, having a higher DPI range and requiring less power, but I haven't noticed a difference in my usage, because I typically stay between 1600 and 8000 DPI anyway
176	pos	My only complaint in all of this is the software
176	pos	I really wish there was a way to export settings from one mouse and import them to another, especially two mice which are so similar
176	pos	I had to recreate my profiles manually, which was a pain, but not enough to detract a star
177	neg	Mouse seems to track well and the g hub software is adequate
177	neg	My main issue with this mouse is how easy it is to accidentally bump the dpi change buttons while gaming
177	neg	My older G700s did not have this issue
177	neg	Also the tactile feel of the side thumb buttons is not as good as my older G700s
177	neg	The forward and back buttons are smooth and the feel between them is almost indistinguishable
177	neg	The only reason I switched is the older G700s mouse developed tracking issues after many years of faithful service
177	neg	I will seek out a better alternative as the inadvertent dpi switching is becoming an issue while gaming
178	pos	I'm not a professional gamer or reviewer first of all, and I am not paid for this review
178	pos	However, I have played FPS and MMORPG games on PC since the late 90's
178	pos	This mouse is way more than satisfactory for my preferences, and I am picky about weight, adjustable weights, feet that glide smoothly, supportive software, customization, lighting, scroll wheel functionality, ergonomics, and of course braided cable
178	pos	I'm a little old school so I prefer wired
178	pos	This mouse meets my criteria and expectations, I bought 3
178	pos	Compared to several other more expensive brands, with more complex names and software that actually causes OS issues at times, this works extremely well
178	pos	No brain buy here
179	neg	This thing has been an absolute nightmare since I’ve bought it
179	neg	Holding down the left mouse button and performing things like simple click and drag functions, were close to impossible as the mouse would without warning unclick or register the holding of the mouse as a double click
179	neg	This mouse has cause significant problems when navigating important networking drives for work, as a simple click and drag results in the mouse arbitrarily rearranging my networks as the dragging doesnt complete and suddenly I am moving large sections of my network to other parts within said network due to the dragging being interrupted by the intermittent clicking
179	neg	I found temporary solution by pulling up the left mousing button and attempting to flatten the plastic piece a bit, however this has now resulted in the whole left wing of the mouse snapping off
179	neg	I cannot explain how upsetting this entire ordeal has been for me
180	neg	I'm not the only one with this problem it seems, but the switches in this mouse don't hold up to even light gaming
180	neg	I've had it for 3 months minus a day, and already I have lost the ability to click and drag *at all*
180	neg	Not sometimes
180	neg	It's just borked
180	neg	I also sometimes register clicks as double clicks
180	neg	Overall the left click died far too fast
180	neg	I'll attempt to RMA it, but I'm guessing that these switches just don't stand the test of time
180	neg	Otherwise I like the thing
180	neg	Great ergonomics, great sensor
180	neg	If it could last a couple of years then maybe it'd be worth $50, but
180	neg	This is just straight up unacceptable out of a company as big as Logitech, and a switch that they say will last for 50 million clicks
180	neg	Granted
180	neg	it still clicks
180	neg	Maybe that test doesn't verify at what point the mouse starts accidentally registering double clicks
180	neg	Or when click and hold is lost
180	neg	Either way, no good
181	pos	____________________CONS_____________________weight:This mouse is too heavy for actual competitive gaming
181	pos	When you try to flick with this mouse, chances are you'll overaim and miss due to the leftover inertia the mouse had
181	pos	The fact that logitech would add attachable weights just  blows my mind
181	pos	I've been using this mouse for the better part of a year now, and looking back at it, I regret that I didn't just buy a steelseries mouse instead
181	pos	curvature of the mouse:This could just be a ME problem, but my hands are fairly average-sized
181	pos	This mouse's curvature makes it so that in order to get a comfortable grip, your pinky and ring finger are forced to hang off the side and drag on my desk
181	pos	If logitech added the thumb-rest bit, why couldn't they do the same for the pinky and ring finger
181	pos	reliability:This could also just be a ME problem
181	pos	I game a lot with this mouse, and so far it's held up great
181	pos	However, some days the left mouse button (lmb) and right mouse button (rmb) would just stop working properly
181	pos	For example, spraying a gun in CS:GO
181	pos	If holding down the lmb, it would stutter and would stop shooting mid-spray
181	pos	I've died countless times to this issue, and the same goes the the rmb
181	pos	I don't abuse this mouse, never dropped it from even above KNEE height, and that's coming from a dude who's 5'7''
181	pos	_____________________PROS_____________________extremely customizable:Installing logitech G-hub is little to no hassle, and making macros makes using this mouse extremely fun
181	pos	The feel of the material doesn't feel cheap at all (which for an 80$ mouse should be a given) and the curve of the mouse feels great on my hand
181	pos	visually satisfying:it looks sleek and, for lack of a better word, cool
181	pos	Nothing I could say could possibly change this
181	pos	cool scroll button:you can toggle it between going by intervals or just flat-out spinning like a wheel
181	pos	Pretty useful for any tasks that require spamming inputs really quickly
181	pos	_____________________CONCLUSION_____________________is it worth 80 bucks
181	pos	No
181	pos	You'd be better off buying a lighter mouse from steelseries, or maybe even a logitech g pro wireless when it goes on discount
181	pos	Point is, the g502 hero is one of the worse mice you can get from logitech
181	pos	Not worst, worse
181	pos	Please do yourself a favor and buy a different mouse
182	pos	Simplemente maravilloso, la primera vez que lo tube en mis manos y probe un Shooter con el me sentí desorientado, pero me acostumbre a el rápidamente, los botones para vajar y subir el DPI son la santa leche, me encanto el boton que suelta la rueda del rato, me sirve para desplazarme rapidamente entre contenido
182	pos	Calidad del producto-9/10Rendimiento en juego-10/10(buenisimo si bajas el app y configuras el DPI)Comodidad-8/10(le pondria 10/10,pero el boton de shift DPI esta muy lejos del dedo gordo y eso lo vuelve en su parte un poco inservible)Recomendacion:Si buscas un mouse que te sea util a la hora de jugar un shooter en el cual necesites usar muchos tus reflejo con el mouse(Rainbow six, COD, etc) este es tu mouse
182	pos	9/10
183	pos	Have had this mouse for a couple of years
183	pos	Overall I like it except for the mouse wheel
183	pos	When you are scrolling through things it tends to "jump" really far ahead or really far back and it is incredibly annoying
183	pos	You have to move kind of slow and deliberately and put some pressure on the whell when doing a lot of scrolling
183	pos	And it's doubly annoying when it's on "free" scroll where it doesn't click because every time you take your hand off the scroll wheel it either jumps backwards or it just keeps on scrolling and if I even bump my desk it starts scrolling
184	pos	Pros:1) "Logitech G Hub" desktop application allows to setup lighting effects, DPI sensitivity, button assignment2) You can adjust mouse weight by adding/removing metallic parts to the bottom of the mouse - it has special container for metal weights3) Comfortable claw grip4) DPI settings can be adjusted using buttons on the left on the fly5) Button behind the wheel changes between infinite scroll and a very rigid oneCons: noneSummary: this particular gaming mouse is on par with Razer Basilisk series v1/2/3
184	pos	I can easily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice gaming or regular mouse with additional comfort
185	pos	The Pros:The mouse itself is well built
185	pos	It has quite a few buttons that are somewhat useful in every day life
185	pos	Adjustable DPI settings are an interesting touch, though are troublesome without working software
185	pos	Overall, the feel of the mouse is good, especially if you have larger hands like me
185	pos	I love the dual mode scroll wheel as well
185	pos	That's probably my favorite feature
185	pos	The Cons:LG Hub software is garbage
185	pos	It installed but would not run on my Win 10 x64 PC
185	pos	It's a fairly fresh OS install without any other Logitech software
185	pos	I have tried re-installing several times without any success
185	pos	LGS installed and ran just fine however
185	pos	It's older software but it actually works
185	pos	There isn't any reason for peripheral software to be this troublesome
185	pos	It really doesn't do that much
185	pos	Instructions for the mouse are also quite poor
185	pos	It wasn't obvious what G Shift is for DPI settings or how to adjust the DPI settings with the mouse itself
185	pos	LGS software simplified this a bit
185	pos	Overall, I would recommend this mouse if you find it on sale for under $50
185	pos	The updated Logitech software is trash though
185	pos	Don't bother with it
186	neg	I went with the G502 to accommodate fairly large hands, and it's much better than most of the mice I've tried, but I wish it was still a bit wider
186	neg	The scroll wheel is very loud, probably even louder than Razer's typical sound which I already found too loud, and despite being very new, I'm already seeing the occasional case of the scroll wheel notches getting slightly off of the actual software response, which is what I was replacing my last mouse for in the first place
186	neg	Like every mouse I've tried, this one is good, but not great
186	neg	I had found the perfect mouse at one point, but it was discontinued and replaced with one that's terrible, so I'm using this one for now, and I'm happy enough with it
186	neg	Update: After about 6 months, this mouse has broken in some way that makes it unusable
186	neg	The sensor no longer tracks accurately and something as simple as clicking a link on a web page is nearly impossible due to the random movement it's adding to my motion
186	neg	I still haven't found a mouse that's actually good
187	neg	I used to own the original version of the G502 and has lasted me 5 years with no problems at all
187	neg	I decided it was time for an upgrade to the latest version for the RGB, but this newest version has been extremely disappointing
187	neg	Within a month my left mouse button developed issues that resulted in clicking when there is no input, clicks not registering when there is input, and double clicking when releasing the button
187	neg	I spent 3 weeks with Logitech support to try to get it RMAed and the process was just pain staking
187	neg	I ended up reaching out to Amazon and they very graciously sent me a free replacement and saved me the hassle of having to jump through the numerous hoops with Logitech
187	neg	My replacement mouse is already displaying the same symptoms of the first mouse
187	neg	Less than a month in and I get phantom clicks and unintended double clicks
187	neg	There was a time I swore by Logitech peripherals, but I think it's time to shop for a different brand
187	neg	If you're looking to buy this for gaming, I recommend you look elsewhere
188	pos	I'm a huge Logitech fan but this one is a failure, pretty much anything with the name HERO from them is a ZERO
188	pos	Look up G502 double click on youtube and you will have a plethora of videos to watch, that isn't people making a video to complain that people making a video to show Logitech the mouse they bought last month is busted and they are only doing it for the warranty
188	pos	Its a shame this is a product that is still for sale but if you do go against your better judgment and buy this, register for the warranty the same day you receive it
188	pos	You will thank me next month
189	pos	This mouse has a solid build quality and is comfortable for any grip style
189	pos	I prefer a palm grip but will sometimes use a claw grip and holding the mouse is comfortable either way
189	pos	The G502 is more on the heavy side for a mouse and I don't see a need to use any of the included weights
189	pos	The mass of this mouse could be an issue for some people, as they may notice some fatigue with constantly moving the mouse around
189	pos	I'd say the only issues I've had so far have been getting the cable trained to lay how I want it and acclimating to the scroll wheel being a smooth metal surface rather than rubberized
189	pos	Coming from a G500s, I miss the rubberized scroll wheel but not enough for this to be a major issue for me now that I'm used to the smoother metal
189	pos	The cable takes a few days to fully train, depending on what shape it needs to be
189	pos	Straightening it was simple enough and getting it to maintain a curve wasn't terribly hard
189	pos	Within a week, I had the cable situated mostly how I wanted it
189	pos	Gaming and general usage so far have been great
189	pos	The range of DPI settings mean I can set exactly the speed I want and the DPI switching buttons are great for people who prefer having a few options for movement and aiming
189	pos	The sensor seems to work on just about any normal desk surface
189	pos	I've used mine on a couple mouse pads, wood, and glass
189	pos	So far the only surface I had any trouble with was glass but that was even pretty mild, all things considered
190	pos	This is the best gaming mouse I have ever owned
190	pos	I love the software, buttons, and all the cool stuff you can do
190	pos	The top feature for me in particular is the scroll wheel, which with the press of a button lets you scroll freely instead of having it click in steps
190	pos	I can't go to any other mouse now since to my knowledge none have that feature, and makes me wonder why other brands haven't universally adopted the feature
190	pos	It is essentially, the perfect mouse except as others have mentioned, you are likely to start having problems with the left and right click 'double clicking' on press
190	pos	After hours of searching, I found a fix in a random youtube comment without having to pull the mouse apart by blowing out the left and right buttons, holding them down for 10s, shaking, twisting a bit, then holding down again and shaking some more somewhat carefully without being too rough
190	pos	It seems there must be some dust or grime that gets caught in the clicking mechanisms over time
190	pos	After that it was fixed and I didn't have problems again, but if I do I'll try it again
190	pos	Certainly not a perfect fix and why I knocked off 2 stars on quality of material, but its better than having to switch to a different and inferior mouse
191	pos	A fully programmable mouse with plenty of easy to reach buttons and a fun lighting scheme
191	pos	Sold
191	pos	Logitech still proves they are king of the hill
191	pos	The embedded software is easy to use and low maintenance
191	pos	The mouse feels great and has simple weights that can be added to increase the heft
191	pos	Lots of buttons that can be programmed for intuitive use
191	pos	1 star off for the DPI buttons being to easy to click in between the left click and the back click
191	pos	So all of a sudden having your mouse speed up or slow down means you need to train yourself as to how you position your fingers
191	pos	Beyond that minor qualm, it's a great gaming mouse
192	neg	i don't know who dropped the ball on the click sensors for this iteration of the g502 series
192	neg	i have owned 3 g502 heros in the span of around 8 months with each one having the ending up with the same problem, the right click will begin to freak out; registering several clicks with a single press/hold
192	neg	this makes aiming down sights in games impossible and has remained a consistent issue through out all 3 of the g502 heros I've owned
192	neg	the first one started showing issues 4 months after i bought it
192	neg	i purchased a second mouse to replace it, this time with a warranty
192	neg	that one started acting up 3 weeks later
192	neg	same problem, Spazzy right click
192	neg	i am now on my 3rd mouse
192	neg	i got i for free thanks to the warranty i got with the previous one, and it started acting up a month ago, can you guess what the problem was
192	neg	Yup
192	neg	Spazzy right click
192	neg	honestly i don't really care to buy another mouse, or any product from Logitech going forward
192	neg	the problems i had with this mouse were too consistent to be a coincidence
192	neg	it's a shame too, because this used to be a really good mouse
193	pos	I own a lot of 'gaming' mice and this is the best of the bunch, worth every penny
193	pos	Only issues for me is this mouse is bigger than I expected (doesn't work for my wife, who has smaller hands) and I don't like the placement of the buttons by the thumb
193	pos	I would accidently activate these buttons all the time when I first got the mouse, but eventually got used to it, and realized I had to place my thumb between the buttons and a little bit back from where I would naturally place my thumb
193	pos	Other than that this mouse is outstanding
193	pos	Buttery smooth mouse movements
193	pos	I love the programmability of all the buttons, I love the apps, you can adjust settings to a fine level of detail
193	pos	The craftmanship/feel is top-notch
193	pos	There is a huge difference between this mouse and other cheaper gaming mice, definitely worth the price if it's in your budget
194	pos	* I love that I do I not get occasionally most jumps, jitters or lag like I do with Bluetooth mouse
194	pos	As much as I don't like wires, I've never met a perfect wireless mouse (yet)
194	pos	* The cord is well thought out
194	pos	I don't even notice it most of the time
194	pos	* Smooth as butter
194	pos	Slides like a dream* I love being able to program the exact speed of movement I want (I'm insanely picky)
194	pos	* Not just great for gaming, but also great for photo editing
194	pos	I'm always doing very tiny meticulous details & no other mouse has been good for that except this one
195	neg	The mouse itself is okay
195	neg	But the LED for the logo which you can change doesn't show pure white color
195	neg	It has blue tone of color added to the white color and comes out in this weird color
195	neg	(I don't even know how I should call it)And the Logitec software doesn't give you much you could do with the LED
195	neg	One solid color, rainbow or off
195	neg	That's it
195	neg	No patterns or anything
195	neg	There's no pattern to choose even if you set it to one color
195	neg	So if you are planning to change the LED to white color, consider other brand
196	pos	I am not a hardcore gamer, so I do not take advantage of the full customizing features for this mouse
196	pos	However, I do love what I have customized with the settings for my regular day-to-day uses
196	pos	I like that I can add weights to the mouse
196	pos	The mouse is very responsive when I click around
196	pos	I did discover with this mouse the delight of having a scroll wheel that you can change how it scrolls
196	pos	Overall, an excellent mouse worth the price point of $40
196	pos	Don't pay over that
196	pos	Also, the pleasure of making the DPI setting faster than what the computer's DPI setting is maxed out at is great
197	neg	*Update* I got a replacement mouse, and after about 5 months of use, it no longer registers left clicks consistently
197	neg	This is a garbage product, especially since its marketed to the FPS market
197	neg	I'm unable to play FPS at all anymore; I can hold my button down using an automatic weapon, and it will fire a SINGLE shot
197	neg	This mouse has been a waste of time, money, and energy
197	neg	I'm not going to bother trying to get a 3rd mouse
197	neg	This is a garbage product
197	neg	I bought this mouse on March 29 of 2019, and its already having a lot of problems
197	neg	I enjoyed it while it worked, but it has slowly stopped doing that
197	neg	Sensor and most of the buttons work fine, but the left mouse button is not working properly
197	neg	It will either register a click, double click, no click, or 'unclick' when holding the button down
197	neg	Its sorely disappointing after only having it for a year
197	neg	So far its impeding my workflow and ability to game properly, and Logitech Support has been startlingly unhelpful (its still under warranty)
197	neg	None of the problems I'm facing are isolated or rare: google search results will tell you as much
197	neg	Lots of people on tech forums are exacting the same frustrations
197	neg	I ordered a Corsair Scimitar Pro to replace this
197	neg	After 15 years of using Logitech mice, ever since the launch of the gaming brand, with the G5, I've decided to go elsewhere
197	neg	If you're mulling this model over: look elsewhere
197	neg	Its an endemic issue for this particular model
198	pos	I play Call Of Duty Modern Warfare, COD WWII, Modern Warfare 2, Black OPS 4 and this mouse is very comfortable
198	pos	Many complain that this mouse is heavy, but it doesn't feel heavy to me
198	pos	I guess it all comes down to personal preference
198	pos	This mouse has on-board memory, which let's you save your configuration into it
198	pos	This is nice, since I don't want to always run the Logitech software, and it's good for when you use this mouse on another computer and don't have the software there
198	pos	Anyways, I only created one profile with it and I have my lowest DPI to 400
198	pos	That's what I use for FPS games
198	pos	Then I set another DPI to 1200, which I use for when I am browsing the Internet
198	pos	With this mouse, it's so easy to change DPI with the DPI buttons
198	pos	Since my DPI is already set, I am free to delete the Logitech software
198	pos	If you are gaming on a Linux computer, you can always set your mouse settings through a Windows PC or a Virtual Machine
198	pos	It's a plus that it has on-board memory
198	pos	The side buttons are very tactile and feel really solid
198	pos	Also, the left and right mouse click buttons have very low travel time and feel very responsive
198	pos	I got big hands and play claw style
198	pos	I highly recommend this mouse for anyone that has big hands
199	pos	i purchased this product in may of 2019 bc people were giving it good reviews
199	pos	the same people also tried to say the mouse looked "cool" so i should have known from there they were poor sources
199	pos	Tried it for a month and realized it was too small for my hands and the "sniper" button wasn't given much thought to its placement
199	pos	The build quality felt cheap especially when it came to the rattling of the mouse wheel
199	pos	So i bought the newer m65 corsair and put the g502 on the shelf as a backup if my corsair ever went down
199	pos	Well last month my corsair bit the dust and a new one is on the way
199	pos	Corsair has great CS from my experience
199	pos	Well since I procrastinated i had to use the g502 for the month and at the end of that month the left click feature started to double left click aprox
199	pos	2 out of every 5 attempts
199	pos	To sum it up, the mouse is ugly, cheap, looks like it was made for a child gamer to beg his parents to buy for them bc it looks futuristic and has a high DPI
199	pos	But anyone beyond the age of 15 knows both of those things are pointless when it comes to having a solid mouse
199	pos	BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, the left click feature started failing after a little over 2 months of use
199	pos	This mouse is good if you have tiny hands and like to have 50 different dpi settings accessible at your fingertips
199	pos	I have no idea why someone would need that many dpi settings or a 16000 dpi max
199	pos	I put in a request for a new g502 bc its still covered under warranty
199	pos	I will update this post once said company responds
200	pos	Logitech makes really good computer accessories
200	pos	I bought two of these for my kids for Christmas who are all into playing computer games
200	pos	They watch these professional gamers who are using items like this and as a result think they need it too for better gaming
200	pos	They were all excited when they saw I got them this mouse but after a few days of using it I could tell they were not all that impressed
200	pos	It lights up and looks cool, but it is ultra sensitive
200	pos	Even if you adjust your sensitivity or add some of the weights the mouse comes with it is still really sensitive
200	pos	Maybe my kids just aren't good gamers, but they prefer my cheap Logitech wireless mouse over this one
200	pos	For the price, I would not buy it again
201	pos	The Logitech G502 in my opinion, is one of the best mice on the market you would ever get
201	pos	Every button on the mouse is programmable, but there are 5 extras that you can use for DPI or macros
201	pos	You have to download either Logitech Gaming Software, or Logitech G Hub to assign the macros to your mouse
201	pos	The ergonomics of the mouse are really good
201	pos	I can keep a really good grip on the mouse, and its textured rubber on the sides help with gripping
201	pos	I have quite large hands, and it still works flawlessly for me
201	pos	Only thing is, depending on the person it might take some getting use to when you first use the mouse, as your hand might feel placed odd
201	pos	People typically categorize how you hold the mouse in three types, palm, claw or hybrid
201	pos	I personally use a hybrid grip on my mouse, for most control
201	pos	It has a really large range for DPI, but of course most gamers don’t use so high of a DPI speed, and it is only a marketing gimmick for your mouse to be that high
201	pos	The mouse has on-board memory in case of no internet or if you need to play somewhere other than your house
201	pos	It only saves your RGB profiles and your sensitivity/DPI profiles
201	pos	This mouse cannot save macros onto the onboard memory
201	pos	The RGB lighting of the mouse is lackluster, but that is fine by me
201	pos	It has lightning for the Logitech logo itself, and the DPI lighting on the side
201	pos	RGB for me is not a must, and is only a nice edition to have
201	pos	Now the most important thing, the weight
201	pos	This mouse weighs 125g, and comes with metal weights to make it heavier if wished
201	pos	Personally, I keep it right at 125 grams in order to keep it down, but for me it actually doesn’t matter
201	pos	Some people might steer clear of this mouse because of that, and if you like lighter mice, this one isn’t for you
201	pos	The weight actually comes in advantage for me, as the weight of the mouse balances the speed at which I move it
201	pos	There is one issue that is common for the mouse, and that is the dreaded double-click issue that occurs with the G502
201	pos	The switches for the buttons may begin to register two presses
201	pos	You can actually use the software to fix the issues, but that takes the use of macros away from you
201	pos	Overall this mouse is a godsend, and is what made me use Logitech for all of my peripherals
202	pos	I've had so many of these G502 mouses, reason being why so many is in the span of about 5-6 years
202	pos	The mouse is great for small/med hands, its ergonomic, feels great can adjust the weight
202	pos	The Logitech Gaming Software is also amazing, no issues
202	pos	set up macros, keybinds etc, change DPI on the fly of a button
202	pos	The only issue i have is a bit with the build quality its mostly plastic which is fine it has a decent feel for durability for a few months for me personally the side rubber grips get worn out so i end up buying a replacement
202	pos	But other than that i highly recommend it
202	pos	Overall 5 stars
203	neg	This product has a massive design flaw
203	neg	Logitech choose to go with cheap Chinese switches for this mouse and in a short period of time the switches are going to break
203	neg	This causes the LMB and RMB double-click for no reason, a lot of times while still holding the button down
203	neg	Logiyech is well aware of this issues yet they do nothing about it
203	neg	A recall to replace these cheap Chinese switches should be made by Logitech
203	neg	The ergonomics and the sensor are great but not enough to justify buying something only to last a few months or a year
204	pos	This is a great mouse
204	pos	I bought it for gaming, and it is ergonomic and the click of the mouse is just right, not too loud
204	pos	You can quickly interchange between DPI speed with a certain button, so it’s very convenient
204	pos	It has lots of buttons that make navigating your computer a breeze
204	pos	It also comes with some weights that you can put within the mouse to make it heavier or lighter based on what you like
204	pos	This mouse works for drag clicking and the scroll button can click sideways and downward, as well as two scrolling settings, you can make it scroll very fast and smoothly or have normal scrolling
204	pos	Definitely a great buy
205	pos	I've had this mouse now for about 3 weeks
205	pos	This is the first programmable mouse I've ever bought
205	pos	I was very iffy at first because there are so many buttons on most programable mouses so I wanted something that was simple but yet effective for low-end gaming
205	pos	I was pleasantly surprised at how easily I was able to program keys to the mouse via their software which didn't take very long to download
205	pos	I just keep the program up at all times and If I feel like changing a button I can do so in less than 15 seconds
205	pos	You could also close the program and open from your desktop in seconds
205	pos	I have smaller hands for a guy but the mouse still feels great
205	pos	If my hands were a little bit larger it would be perfect
205	pos	I haven't had any mechanical issues
205	pos	All the buttons work well (no double clicking)
205	pos	I love the feature of the mouse wheel where if you push the button in below the wheel, it either opens fully or restricts slightly the motion of the wheel
205	pos	Basically, the one motion is like that of a normal mouse wheel and the other motion scrolls nearly indefinitely depending how fast you spin the wheel
205	pos	It's really cool
205	pos	I noticed that compared to any standard mouse I've ever used, my precision and accuracy of mouse movements has been greatly increased when using this mouse
205	pos	I noticed this especially while gaming
205	pos	I haven't messed around with the weights, but you can add/remove weights to make the mouse heavier/lighter
205	pos	I'm just not interested in that and adapted to the default from delivery
205	pos	The lighting options on the mouse are cool but that's just supplemental
205	pos	It's everything else about the mouse that I like
205	pos	I mean, we don't really look at our hand while we are on the computer much do we lol
205	pos	Overall, It's a great mouse
205	pos	I was worried about double-clicking that I read in some other reviews, but I haven't noticed that
205	pos	I will update if I have any issues in the future (if that's a possible function here on amazon)
206	neg	Brand new out of the box, and the cursor when browsing, and my view when playing games jumps randomly around every 30secs or so
206	neg	It's extremely frustrating to say the least
206	neg	I contacted Logitech and I was told to clean the mouse, (again it's brand new), and if that didn't work to change a setting in the driver software
206	neg	Except the setting is from a much older version so can't do that either
206	neg	It's been 2 weeks and I already hate this thing
206	neg	Trying to do anything when your mouse flicks across the screen because you're trying to use it, is beyond annoying
206	neg	I'm not the only one either
206	neg	there's a lot of others complaining as well if you search it
207	pos	UpdateLogitech issues an RMA and I'll see how this one does
207	pos	At least it's supported
207	pos	_-------_The moose was great while it worked, it pairs well with Logitech keyboards and the color is consistent because why not have LEDs everywhere
207	pos	But somewhere in the added complexity of including stuff like that reduces the shelf life
207	pos	I've never actually had a moose "go bad" until now aside from the plastic wearing down or the coating on the outside beginning to peel
207	pos	This mouse seems to be lost as a mouse and I have to unplug and plug it in several times before it is recognised (the problem persists across a sea of ports and computers)It felt like a mouse and it moused very well while it functioned, but losing the connection in the middle of work is annoying
207	pos	Losing the connection during a game session is disheartening
208	neg	Right mouse button started to fail after about a year
208	neg	I'm not a heavy gamer
208	neg	Probably clock 10 hours a month at most
208	neg	I mostly use it for computer graphics work so it was incredibly frustrating when the mouse would basically unclick in the middle of a drag and drop or resizing of a window
208	neg	I was able to remap right click to another button, but for what I paid for it this is incredibly annoying
209	neg	First one was great till it had a double click issue, I assumed it was just me being unlucky and got a second one because it felt great
209	neg	And 1 year into it's life span it gets the double click issue again
209	neg	Updating drivers doesn't work
209	neg	Cleaning the mouse with condensed air works for a day and it double clicks again
209	neg	Just poor quality in whatever they put into the clicker
209	neg	I'll probably put my money elsewhere since logitech pretty much burned me
209	neg	Clarification on the double click issue, pressing the right side for me will double click every time you press it
209	neg	Sometimes sticking so you cannot drag any windows anymore
210	pos	Just got this yesterday so only had a small time to use it but must say its really great
210	pos	There are some good and some bad which I will get into in a moment
210	pos	When I got it my first impressions where "wow this box is small" so was a bit weirded out by it thinking I either got a wrong version of it or maybe it was going to be a tiny mouse but it was the actually correct size for my hand
210	pos	First time having it in my hand it felt right at home
210	pos	Even better the clicking is more accurate in games with minimal effort in comparison to my old mouse which was Corsair M65 Pro
210	pos	The scroll wheel broke on the M65 so was tied between M65 Elite or this and it got me thinking "well if the original M65 has scroll wheel issue the Elite might do the same" so with all the praise I decided to get this over the M65 Elite
210	pos	So glad I did
210	pos	Now onto pros and cons
210	pos	PRO:ComfortableEasy to use1 by 1 DPI in softwareMany buttons/button placements
210	pos	CONS:Mistakenly hitting the sniper button
210	pos	It takes little to no effort to activate it, so when I'm clicking left my thumb naturally hits it due to placement
210	pos	It's very impressive that the mistaken clicks are my only complaint right now
210	pos	Of course ill update this if anything else occurs
210	pos	I would recommend this product
210	pos	UPDATE 4/30/19: Had it for a few months i think but now it's causing an issue
210	pos	Random double clicks when i try to hold down and drag something on my screen, noticed it when i was playing a game, caused my character to drop it on the ground instead of move it
210	pos	Seems this is a big issue going on with ANY G502 models
210	pos	Found an article saying "disable Vsync and should fix it" did that and nope did not, even tho that was voted best solution on the official logitech site in 2016
210	pos	Something to be cautious about
211	pos	Update: I couldn't return the item because shipping internationally is very expensive, so Amazon sent a $30 refund and I could keep the mouse
211	pos	First, the box was damaged a bit (As shown in picture) but that's okay, when I opened it up the mouse was dusty and dirty, it clearly had been used and refurbished (The box was sealed)
211	pos	There were smudges and scratches beneath the mouse
211	pos	The mouse looks sick and all, but it's actually not comfortable at all
211	pos	After using it for an hour, the feeling of discomfort is ON
211	pos	The worst part of this mouse is customization, the software (Logitech G hub) doesn't let you customize the buttons, after a research on google, there's an older software (Logitech Gaming software) which does customize the buttons, but it's pain in the back, it took me an hour to figure out how this software works
211	pos	The scroll wheel is so stiff
211	pos	And that (Hyper scroll wheel) feature is cool but it's actually useless in games
211	pos	Overall I'm not happy with this mouse for its price, I have better choices for even cheaper prices
211	pos	I'm returning it and I advice everyone NOT to fall for it just cuz it has cool features that you won't actually use
212	pos	Got this mouse because of a recommendation from a friend
212	pos	He uses it for everything from MMOs to FPS games
212	pos	The mouse feels great in the hand and all of the programable buttons are easy to reach
212	pos	It also has additional weights to get your desired amount of drag resistance
212	pos	The build quality seems pretty good
212	pos	The scroll wheel is solid, the cable is braided, and the buttons all have a good feel to them
212	pos	The Logitech software is very good for setting up macros, mapping buttons, changing RGB settings, etc
212	pos	Overall it seems like a great mouse for the price
213	pos	First off, I love how it manages to have little weights that I didn't think I needed
213	pos	I keep mine heavy for better mouse control
213	pos	Plus, it's an excellent workout for your hand and arm movement
213	pos	And it's comfortable too when holding it
213	pos	The mouse response is good, plus the side buttons are an excellent feature
213	pos	Having those shortcuts on the mouse is perfect if your extended fingers on your other hand can't press a specific button on the keyboard
213	pos	Minor issues to keep in mind, it has a lot of open edges/corners that can collect dust and dead skin cells
213	pos	So be sure to clean it when not in use
213	pos	Steep price aside, I'd say it's a near-perfect mouse for your gaming and content creation needs
214	neg	There are 2 main reasons for negative reviews on this mouse
214	neg	1
214	neg	the hardware sucks, and brakes 2
214	neg	the software to use this for gaming sucks
214	neg	I actually got used to the G Hub software
214	neg	A lot of complaints around this but I have no issues with it
214	neg	I took a chance on this mouse and yep, the hardware broke in short order
214	neg	I am so surprised
214	neg	I have the MX anywhere 2 and MX anywhere 3 and they are solid and I stuff them haphazardly in bags for transport all the time
214	neg	This mouse has just been on my desk with light use and already has issues
215	neg	I bought this mouse in summer 2019, giving Logitech one last go after having at the time just lost yet another Logitech mouse to the double-click issue
215	neg	I thought maybe a $50 mouse would be made of some tougher stuff, but it began double-clicking occasionally after only 6 months
215	neg	A year later, it has gotten to the point that I am looking for a replacement
215	neg	I am also having issues with the scroll wheel failing to register when I attempt to scroll up, a problem I've never had with any other mouse before
215	neg	For those not in the know, the issue I'm talking about causes the mouse to register multiple clicks from one tap of the left mouse button, causing double-clicks when you intend to do single clicks, and randomly registering additional clicks while attempting to click and drag
215	neg	It doesn't happen on every click, but as the mouse ages, it happens more and more until it is eventually unusable
215	neg	This is caused by Logitech using cheap switches that break quickly, and despite years of people complaining about this, they have not done anything about it, I guess because it's a net win for them as long as the warranty has expired before the problem starts
215	neg	At this point I am convinced that the only way to avoid this problem is to find another brand for my next mouse
215	neg	That said, I gave this 2 stars because it was great for those first 6 months
215	neg	It would probably be a solid purchase for someone who feels confident enough to take the mouse apart and solder in higher quality switches, but that's not me, and I imagine, not most consumers
215	neg	Otherwise, maybe find a brand that is less shameless about their planned obsolescence
216	pos	This is my 3rd G502
216	pos	I had one at home for the longest time, then saw a good deal on the special edition model and grabbed another; at which time I took my older G502 to my work office
216	pos	Unfortunately the Special Edition started having sustained click & drag problems, making it difficult drag & drop or highlight items after around a year of use
216	pos	I have since then tossed that one away and replaced my home Mouse with another standard G502
216	pos	Both of my standard G502s have worked perfectly for me
216	pos	The ergonomics are great, the button features are pleasant without being over riddled
216	pos	I just consider this mouse to be perfect for me
217	pos	I've used and preferred Logitech mice off an on for over 30 years and at one time I liked the feel of the Microsoft Explorer mouse, but the Microsoft mice would die in under <3 years regularly, so I'm back to Logitech, but the wheel on my last G502 went afoul in under 3 years too - here's to hoping this one last longer so I don't have to start trying other brands again
217	pos	Yes, I do recommend Logitech products in general because they've been doing it right longer than most of the rest, but beware they aren't quite is sturdy as they once were
218	pos	I have been using mice since Windows 95
218	pos	This mouse comes with added weights as many do
218	pos	Not so sure I'll use them, time will tell
218	pos	As it is this mouse is very heavy which I like a lot
218	pos	More programable buttons than my last 3 button mouse
218	pos	That will be well used in World of Warcraft and Grounded the Game
218	pos	This manufacturer has a very good rep especially with me
218	pos	Quality
218	pos	I just got it today and it is: Be A Utiful
218	pos	Any problems and I'll update
218	pos	Rubber with bumpy grips on left and right, helps hold the hand in place
218	pos	The cord is fabric lined so it doesn't have a "memory" of staying in a position it shouldn't
218	pos	Not as wide as an M1Abrams and not as thin as T****'* ego
218	pos	I love it so far
219	pos	I've used other brands, but I've always ended up using Logitech ended up going back to Logitech
219	pos	This particular model has been one of my favorites and I use it on my main gaming desktop as well as my work laptop
219	pos	It has enough buttons to make it flexible without having so many as to make it overly complicated, especially for fingers that are not in the small glove category
219	pos	Price point calls for watching for sales, but quality, as advertised, delivery time, longevity of use, and ease of use make this one a winner
219	pos	I've used this model for several years and am completely satisfied
220	pos	The mouse itself is great, from a hardware standpoint
220	pos	Fastest sensor, max of 25k dpi, reliable switches, what's not to like
220	pos	Well, the design
220	pos	There are 2 buttons right next to the left mouse button, the most used button on a mouse, the 2 buttons adjust the dpi (sensitivity) of the mouse
220	pos	Because they are literally right next to the left mouse button, it is super easy to accidentally press on it
220	pos	I had to remove all other profiles from G Hub (Logitech Software), so that the 2 buttons are virtually disabled
220	pos	Or I guess you can also functionally disable them in G Hub
220	pos	Anyway, the rest of the mouse's design are alright, just takes some getting used to if you came from a Razer, whose mouses tend to be quite simplistic (except Naga)
221	pos	First of all, this is a really comfortable mouse to use
221	pos	I can't say enough good things about it - for the first 5 months
221	pos	At that point - almost as if there was a timer in it, the left mouse button becomes intermittent
221	pos	Especially for a gamer, this is critical
221	pos	You are at an extreme disadvantage when the trigger fails 50% of the time - until a few days later it is completely gone
221	pos	I do play a lot, I'll admit
221	pos	This is my fifth one, now
221	pos	I'm finally thinking of switching
221	pos	But it is so comfortable
221	pos	If only I didn't have to keep a backup
222	pos	I purchased this mouse in April 2020 to go along with the PC I'd just built to game my way through the pandemic
222	pos	For at least a year it was the greatest mouse I'd ever used, very easy to hold, customizable weights, lightweight accompanying Logitech software, the mouse looks great
222	pos	BUTBut then, I started having an issue that, though it may seem small, makes the mouse unusable in certain situations: My right mouse button developed a stutter
222	pos	Holding the RMB down will intermittently register multiple clicks
222	pos	It's absolutely unbearable for any FPS game where pressing right click scopes you in, and releasing right click scopes you out
222	pos	The result is that often, right click either doesn't scope me in at all, or it chaotically flies in and out of scope to terrible effect
222	pos	I like the mouse so much that I'm to give it another chance
222	pos	I know that there are others who have reported similar clicking issues, so it must be a manufacturing problem
222	pos	I will be purchasing my second-chance mouse along with a 4-year protection plan so I can replace it worry free
222	pos	If the second-chance mouse is problem free, I'll come back and give this mouse a 4-star review, because it really is a great mouse
223	neg	I absolutely love this mouse as a device
223	neg	The buttons are great, it feels good in the hand, it's very responsive
223	neg	What drives me insane is how awful the "GHub" software is
223	neg	It periodically updates and then randomly my mouse stops working until I spend 10-15 minutes fighting with the software to not default to a different profile or update firmware for a feature I don't need
223	neg	Today was my all time favorite -- a firmware update screen that said "do not unplug the mouse
223	neg	" After waiting an hour for something to happen, a quick Google search revealed that to do the upgrade YOU NEED TO UNPLUG THE MOUSE AND PLUG IT BACK IN
223	neg	Imagine writing a piece of software that says specifically not to do the one thing that fixes it
223	neg	Awesome
223	neg	As gravy for what a piece of junk this software is, I also have a Logitech G710+ keyboard that GHub doesn't even recognize
223	neg	I have to separately install and run the Logitech Gaming Software program
223	neg	This annoyed me for awhile but I've ultimately come to the conclusion that it's a good thing because Logitech has stopped touching that program, so it doesn't randomly break my stuff every month or two
224	pos	I use to have a G902 or 901
224	pos	I can't remember
224	pos	I had it for a couple of years before the bluetooth or whatever wireless technology it was using started to go on the fritz
224	pos	There were multiple solutions that led to multiple dead ends
224	pos	I was devastated because it was an amazing mouse
224	pos	It turns out, the problem was very common, and I was lucky enough to have it for as long as I did
224	pos	I ended up leaving a bad review on Amazon, and bad taste with Logitech problems in general
224	pos	I ended up buying a lot of cheap mouses (mice
224	pos	), but there was always something that couldn't compare to the 902
224	pos	After several cheap mice, I decided that if I'm going to spend this much might as well go for something like this
224	pos	I'm not disappointed in the slightest
224	pos	I love this mouse
224	pos	My girlfriend, who is a recent PC gamer convert, loves this mouse
224	pos	There is a wireless version of this, but I'm staying away from that until I absolutely think going wireless is something I need to do
224	pos	This mouse feels comfortable
224	pos	The customizable weights is a great idea
224	pos	The customizable buttons are also great, too
225	neg	Bought this a little over a year ago, started having issues with my left click button clicking multiple times with one click- very annoying and makes it impossible to use
225	neg	I found a macro online that fixed it for a little while, but it started doing it again
225	neg	Basically, Logitech uses cheap & poorly designed switches that wear out easily
225	neg	It's otherwise a great mouse, but it just wears out quick
225	neg	Lots of information online about this issue
225	neg	It does have a "3 year limited warranty", but it has been next to impossible to get support, it's very hard to actually open a ticket to start an RMA, and it sends you in circles on the website when you have this issue
226	pos	11 programmable buttons
226	pos	Most of them have great response time, click well, and aren't mushy at all
226	pos	A good amount of care went into this mouse
226	pos	DPI can be adjusted on-the-fly or if you're like me, those buttons can be used for other purposes like macros, in-game actions, etc
226	pos	The good: 9 high-quality programmable buttons, and the scroll wheel
226	pos	The scroll wheel can be toggled from having a "bumpy" mode to free-spinning using a mechanical button (can't be programmed cause it functions mechanically)
226	pos	Lights up
226	pos	Weight can be changed
226	pos	Profiles can be made for different games and applications
226	pos	DPI display (3 bars of light) allow easy checking of DPI
226	pos	Mouse can be tuned any way you want
226	pos	The bad: G-Hub sucks, but is necessary for most of the mouse's functions
226	pos	Scroll wheel tilt functions are a little more mushy, and it's hard to tell when they're activated
226	pos	Mouse looks "gamer" which may or may not be a positive for you
226	pos	The triangle patterns on both side of the mouse pick up dirt
226	pos	Pretty good mouse
227	neg	Don't waste your time or money
227	neg	After a couple of months of use, this mouse wouldn't function properly, the pointer is jittery and won't hold among other things
227	neg	So, I  called amazon and they first said they were going to replace it via the extra warranty I purchased, which I thought was ridiculous because it was a defective piece of merchandise
227	neg	I waited but it never came
227	neg	I called back again, this time Amazon said it should not have been a replacement through my Asurion policy, and said they would send me a replacement right away
227	neg	I received the replacement, and after a month-not during the time of the 1st or 2nd call to them did they say I would need to return the old mouse
227	neg	A month or so later, I get a email saying I needed to return the old mouse or they will charge me for the 2nd mouse, but don't send me a return label
227	neg	Then they send me an email saying to drop it off at a Kohls store-no box needed
227	neg	I am a handicapped person that lives on the 2nd floor in the apartment complex
227	neg	I do not have transportation and do not go out
227	neg	That's why I have Amazon Prime - for the delivery feature
227	neg	They just charged me $57 for the 2nd mouse and guess what
227	neg	The 2nd mouse is doing the same malfunctions as the first
227	neg	Needless to say, I won't buy this brand again and Amazon has definitely FAILED in its service through this whole process
227	neg	I purchase weekly through Amazon and don't believe that I or anyone else should be treated this way
227	neg	Now, I have to make a third time-consuming call that will aggravate me and make me ill
227	neg	AMAZON, IF YOU'RE READING THIS-AS YOU SHOULD BE-SEND ME A RETURN SLIP AND I WILL SEND BOTH OF THE DEFECTIVE MOUSES BACK
227	neg	And of course, you should refund me for both defective products
228	neg	The media could not be loaded
228	neg	Getting the mouse replaced under warranty, but not holding out hope, as this seems a common problem that gets worse with each mouse over time
228	neg	You can have this problem with either the left or right buttons, or both
228	neg	It will be noticeable when you get false double-clicks (i
228	neg	e
228	neg	when you meant to single click)
228	neg	In my case, had the problem from day 1, but initially thought I was accidentally double clicking & needed to get used to the mouse's button sensitivity
228	neg	But it got worse over time until it was clearly an issue with the mouse
228	neg	Logitech support first had me install their "G Hub" software and update the firmware of the mouse
228	neg	This seemed to correct the problem, but only for a couple weeks
228	neg	This does seem to be something that gradually deteriorates in the switch mechanism of the buttons, and a software fix can only do so much
228	neg	There is a website that can detect the fast/false clicks
228	neg	Logitech warranty support will want a video of you using this website that detects the false/fast clicks
228	neg	See video I've attached, but note they will want a handheld video where you show the physical mouse in your hand and the website on screen, no edits, etc
228	neg	(this is fair--they do have to protect themselves from fraudulent warranty claims)
228	neg	Google "fast double click test" to find the website
228	neg	The problem tends to come and go, and the likelihood of getting a fast/false click may depend on exactly how you are holding the mouse at that moment, which changes as you slide the mouse around or just shift your sitting position
228	neg	For the video here I happened to find a hand position where it was happening most of the time, and carefully kept my hand in that position and pressed the button the same way each time
228	neg	More often I get around 10 bad clicks out of 100
228	neg	Sometimes I get zero out of 100
228	neg	I'll update this review after some time with the replacement
229	pos	I have probably owned 15 or 20 different mice in my life and this one is definetely my favorite
229	pos	I had been using a performance MX but wanted to step up to something with programmable buttons
229	pos	I ordered a G602 (wireless) and I really liked the button layout on that one but I hated the fact that the DPI only went up to 2500 and it also seemed to cut out from time to time
229	pos	So I decided to order the G502 and give it a try
229	pos	What a difference
229	pos	I have slightly large hands, and even though this mouse has a slightly smaller footprint than the g602 it still fits my hand better
229	pos	I mean it REALLY feels great in my hand
229	pos	I tried it out with the extra weights, but I find that I actually prefer it without them
229	pos	Bottom line is this is definitely my favorite mouse I have ever owned by a long shot
229	pos	Well worth the $80
229	pos	Well done logitech
229	pos	I also love the logitech gaming software and the ability to adjust your DPI profile settings and such
230	pos	I had logitech mice for decades and I want to tell you that quality of Logitech is degrading over the years :( Sad but true
230	pos	The best wuality mouse from Logitech I had was mighty old MX300
230	pos	If you saw a circuit board itself you would be amased, it is still alive after ages of wuake 3 and counterstrike battles
230	pos	My mouse before this one was G500, good wuality compared to this G502, but not for ky style of play and holding the mouse, but quality much higher then of G502
230	pos	Now lets talk about G502, plastic is much cheaper feeling compared to G500, and regarding scrollwheel it is Awful
230	pos	First of all it grinds like a grinder and it has so much rattle when playing that I was forced to change the scroll wheel, transplanted it from G500
230	pos	G500s scroll wheel is perfect quality
230	pos	We will see how it copes with my play, but I am afraid it wont last forever like my trusty old MX300
231	pos	This mouse feels great
231	pos	The two buttons on the left side are a little too low
231	pos	They need to be slightly higher up so you don't accidentally click them
231	pos	My biggest complaint is the scroll wheel is free flowing
231	pos	It spins too easily and there's no click sensation
231	pos	Meaning when you're playing a game and you need to use the scroll wheel, for switch weapons for example, you're not going to have a good time
231	pos	It's next to useless, so I'll be returning this mouse
231	pos	If you never need to use the scroll wheel at all, this is a great mouse otherwise
232	neg	Update: After uninstalling G Hub and reinstalling LGS the mouse is now recognized in LGS
232	neg	While I have read elsewhere that it is not supported on LGS, it is working so I've added another star
232	neg	So far the mouse itself is good, the software situation is still a mess
232	neg	---If you used Logitech Gaming Software before, expect to start all customization from scratch for all your logitech devices
232	neg	Logitech Gaming Software (LGS) does not recognize this mouse
232	neg	It requires different software (G Hub) which also requires uninstalling LGS
232	neg	With G Hub, the company trashed working and mature software (LGS) in favor of non-functional or barely functional beta software
232	neg	After figuring out how to fix the infinite loading loop, you will still have to start over remaking all customizations and macros for all software
232	neg	There is no working capability to import LGS profiles to GHUB and no option to do this manually due to core design format changes
233	neg	I purchased it on April 2020
233	neg	I play wow and need to hold the right click to turn the camera view
233	neg	And this mouse failed me 5 days ago
233	neg	The right click can still work, but when you hold it
233	neg	it will drop the signal suddenly
233	neg	Usually those gaming mouse can hold around 3-4 years in my past experience
233	neg	Failed within half year is a totally new experience for me
233	neg	Beside this problem, it is a comfortable mouse
233	neg	However, it failed to deliver the basic mouse function
233	neg	I can only give it one star
233	neg	I will try to contact the customer service and will go back to update this post after
234	neg	The left click on this startes getting flaky about 6months after purchase
234	neg	It would randomly drop the click, so click-and-holds were frustrating
234	neg	Issue would come and go, but now it is unusable 15 months after purchase
234	neg	I've noticed the issue is related to click force
234	neg	A full force press causes the drop, while a minimal force seems to work fine
234	neg	My finger just isnt that calibrated
234	neg	Web searches report this issue is a design flaw in the switch
234	neg	Shame; i liked the rest of the mouse and always been a Logitech fan
235	pos	The updated software for the G502 Hero is Clunky, it also renders the "Logitech gaming Software" for older versions of the mouse useless
235	pos	The mouse randomly speeds up and slows down for no reason especially at first since they removed surface tuning in the hero [both core/spectrum had surface tuning options]I've gone back to my worn down G502 Proteus Core, it still gets the job done but after 8 years, probably will just buy another Proteus core instead
235	pos	Very disappointed, will be buying up discontinued proteus core/Spectrum Models
236	pos	Pros:- Easy to map new bindings to each button with the software available
236	pos	- Good solid feel to the mouse overall and about the same size as the razer 2013 deathadder (meaning it's decent for larger hands)
236	pos	- There are included weoghts allowing for adjustment based on personal preference
236	pos	I find certain mice to be too light, so the option for additional weight is personally greatly appreciated
236	pos	Cons:- You are required to download the software for this mouse manually and it isn't the easiest interface I have ever used
236	pos	Without previous software experience (mine being from razer synapse), it might be a challenge for inexperienced users
236	pos	- While I appreciate the mouse wheels ability to unlock completely, I waish there was a adjustment for the sensitivity of the mousewheel akin to that of the razer basilisk
236	pos	I use the mouse wheel for many things in gaming and it's a little janky at times
236	pos	- I know some people really like RGB style customization and this mouse is sub-par in those regards
236	pos	You have the options for quite a few colors, but you only ever see it on the logo about the size of your thumbnail and on the dpi setting adjustment lights
236	pos	Overall a very small area of the mouse that only reallys seems to be there for finding it in a poorly lit environment
236	pos	All in all:This mouse is a great choice for the most seasoned veterans of gaming and the new-comers alike
236	pos	It might not be a great fit for those with small hands, but it provides enoigh versatility to be viable in almost any genre of game (competitive or not)
237	pos	I use to shop for relatively inexpensive mice
237	pos	The most I would spend was around $25
237	pos	This mouse is faster and more responsive than my previous one, which was the Gamdias Ourea mouse
237	pos	The drivers were lacking and the software was unstable on my Amd x570 crosshair hero VIII Wifi motherboard
237	pos	Sometimes the mouse would stop being recognized in my windows 10 pro 64bit 20H2 system
237	pos	Every so often I would have to unplug and replug it back in
237	pos	I have not experienced that issue with this mouse {not even once so far}
237	pos	Software and drivers work perfectly and the support is excellent
237	pos	Highly recommend this mouse for all your gaming needs
238	pos	Got it to replace my MX518 that died
238	pos	I thought about getting another one but figured after using a MX510 MX512 MX518 since 1999 I would try something else
238	pos	This feels a lot like the MX5x series, but more refined
238	pos	Also has more buttons
238	pos	The software is intiutive and doesn't feel bloated
238	pos	Has everything you need to control RGB, DPI and other settings
238	pos	Glides effortlessly on the mousepad
238	pos	I love the option of customizeable weights
238	pos	Highly recommend for this price range
239	neg	This is a great mouse
239	neg	Very responsive and comfortable
239	neg	But expect to have to buy a new one every year because the switches for the left and right click wear out and start double clicking shortly after a year of normal use
239	neg	Mine actually started having issues before the warranty ran out, but Logitech doesn't make it easy to file a warranty claim
239	neg	Eventually got to file a claim which they make you verify the issue by clicking on a box on a site they host
239	neg	Issue is, you can only click a certain number of times before it's deemed defective or not
239	neg	Mine was having an issue, but not reliably enough to be caught by their check so I wasn't able to exchange the mouse
239	neg	The problem kept getting worse and worse and now that the mouse is out of warranty it's very frustrating to use and there's nothing I can do about it
240	neg	I am extremely disappointed with this mouse
240	neg	If you had asked me just one month ago what I thought of it, I'd say "Great
240	neg	"  It worked beautifully, it was very comfortable, and I liked all of the easy to access buttons on the side of the mouse
240	neg	Earlier this month, I started to notice that the right mouse button wasn't detecting when I clicked
240	neg	It seemed to do this randomly, and I'm still not certain if it makes a difference where I press down on the button
240	neg	It seemed like if I kept my finger dead center, it was a little more consistent
240	neg	Now even that doesn't work
240	neg	The only thing that seems to reliably get it to detect the click is pressing down VERY hard whenever I right click
240	neg	In addition, starting yesterday I ran into the same issue others have described where it double-right clicks with only a single click of the button
240	neg	It's getting to the point where a number of games are becoming almost unplayable, so I have to replace the thing
240	neg	Words cannot begin to express my disappointment
240	neg	I bought some cheap 20$ mouse with less than 4 stars in review and it was one of my favorite gaming mice of all time, lasted me at least a couple of years
240	neg	This mouse was more expensive and lasted a measly six months, if that
240	neg	To add insult to injury, I didn't buy the extended protection plan, and the time to replace it has run out
240	neg	So it looks like I'm stuck with it
240	neg	It is possible that what I've experienced is a freak incident
240	neg	It's possible that this was a "One in a million" scenario
240	neg	Maybe no one else will run into this, maybe I wouldn't run into it again if I bought a new one
240	neg	But it doesn't really matter, because in this case I'm the one
240	neg	I do not intend to buy this mouse ever again
241	pos	I've heard some people have had quality control issues, so I was worried when I bought it, but my mouse has been nothing short of stellar
241	pos	No double clicking, very "hefty" feeling (not heavy as in "I can't move the mouse quickly", but heavy as in "that feels sturdy and of good quality"), feels great to hold in my hand
241	pos	You can also add or remove weights from the mouse to control how light you want it to be, which I think is really cool
241	pos	I haven't programmed many of the buttons yet (I guess I'm lazy), but it does have the option for those shortcuts to be customized
241	pos	If you're hesitant, I would definitely recommend this mouse
241	pos	If you happen to be one of the people who gets a defective product like some others in these reviews (which, isn't there almost always that risk on Amazon
241	pos	), I'm sure you could get a replacement or a refund
242	neg	My friend and I both have the same mouse
242	neg	He is on his second mouse and told me that it is the worst mouse to buy since left click has a defect
242	neg	I am on my third mouse and confirmed with him that my third mouse has a defect on left click as well
242	neg	I continued to buy this mouse because I am used to it however I have finally found a suitable mouse to buy
242	neg	I will never buy another logitech mouse again
242	neg	DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES OR ANY PC EDITING
242	neg	This mouse will double click with a single click or when clicking and holding/dragging items it will not register or let the item go
242	neg	YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
243	neg	First off, this is a great mouse when it works properly
243	neg	Unfortunately when I lift off the pad to reposition during gaming it sometimes loses tracking for a moment and launches my view all over the place until it reestablishes tracking
243	neg	I've searched for solutions and it seems to be an somewhat common issue with the Hero sensor
243	neg	I've tried all recommendations including new mouse pads but it will still randomly do it
243	neg	My old Logitech Mx518 never had this problem
243	neg	Some people mentioned using the calibration feature in the Logitech software but this feature has been removed from Hero sensor equipped mice
243	neg	This tracking issue is a deal breaker for me and I've switched back to my old MX518 for now
243	neg	Could be an isolated issue
243	neg	As for ergonomics, I would love to meet the person who decided to put the 2 dpi selector switches right next to the left click button
243	neg	It's way too easy to accidentally hit these during gaming and I ended up having to unbind these in the Logitech app
243	neg	Luckily it also has the side buttons for thumb access that I was able to remind those to
243	neg	Gaming mice need a large left click button to accommodate different grip styles
243	neg	not sure how they screwed that up
243	neg	All in all
243	neg	I wouldn't buy it, the new hero sensors dont live up to the hype and were going backwards in ergonomics
244	neg	The right click on this mouse stopped functioning properly within 8 months
244	neg	It doesn't hold a click, which makes any game using the RMB basically unplayable
244	neg	I contacted customer support (the website is terrible)
244	neg	After two weeks of back and forth, providing a video of the problem, providing a picture with my ticket and serial, I get a message saying it's out of stock and to wait another 3 weeks
244	neg	So guess I need to buy another mouse since I've already waited longer than I would like
244	neg	And who knows when they will actually get around to it
244	neg	Definitely aint gonna buy another logitech mouse though, that's for sure
245	pos	This is my second g502, the first was the original
245	pos	This one is even better with the ability to change the color and the new cable
245	pos	First one lasted a few years of intense use
245	pos	It actually still works but middle button on the wheel started getting eratic and it was about time for a new one
245	pos	That one will be put to use on a spare system for casual use
245	pos	Won't be using that button much on that one
245	pos	I've used quite a few different mice over the years, most I can't even remember
245	pos	My favorite is between this and the original r
245	pos	a
245	pos	t
245	pos	9 I really liked the adjustability of that one, but wasn't sure about the new company making it quite yet
245	pos	With the thinner, lighter cable on the hero and the ability to change the lighting, it's near perfect for me
246	neg	I don't often play click heavy games like shooters
246	neg	I mostly play RPG's, Strategy games, or I use my controller, and I regularly using this mouse for general computing
246	neg	However, I am frustrated that after a little over a year, this mouse developed the same left click issues my last one (Logitech Wired Pro which also lasted a little over a year) did
246	neg	Whenever I perform a single left click, it often clicks twice and when I hold the left mouse button to drag (like you do all the time in a strategy game or moving files around) it will regularly disengage as if I lifted my finger, even though I am not changing pressure
246	neg	Nearly every time I single clicked a space in this text box, while writing this review, I selected the word next to the space like I double clicked or the entire paragraph like I triple clicked
246	neg	Compounding this issue is my long standing loyalty to this company
246	neg	I have a Logitech G213 Keyboard, a G935 headset with all the LED's synced, and I have a set of Logitech speakers on my desk that are 15 years old that sound great and still rumble the windows when the bass hits
246	neg	Even though the last mouse failed, I still bought another, thinking this time would be different
246	neg	I've been using Logitec products and recommended them to others for years (I work in IT), so It doesn't make me happy that these mice keep failing on me from the company that I love
246	neg	Seeing as other people are having these issues, I'm never wanting to get another one of these gaming mice again
246	neg	Might have to start transitioning all my gear to another company soon too
246	neg	Sad day
246	neg	P
246	neg	S
246	neg	I switched to an 8 year old Dell mouse I had lying around so I could finish writing and editing this review
246	neg	Zero issues
246	neg	Hopefully I can get this repaired via warranty
246	neg	I will update this review with how that goes
247	neg	Incredible hardware, but the software is f***ing s***
247	neg	It has an infamous problem where it gets stuck in an infinite loading screen after a fresh install or update
247	neg	There are countless Reddit threads that all detail the same problems and there are so many solutions that it could take days to figure out which one works for you on your computer
247	neg	I love the mouse and it's design, but when I can't change the color settings due to s*** software I do not give a single F*** about your product
247	neg	Take it from someone who has had this mouse since February, the software is deal breaking and Logitech can honestly go f*** itself since there are threads with this problem since 2018 and they haven't fixed it
247	neg	Go buy one of there many competitors and I'm sure you'll like it a lot more
247	neg	I plan to buy one soon but it hurts that I wasted $50
248	neg	My Razer mouse broke so I bought this mouse as it was within my low budget and would fit my large hand
248	neg	The reviews were also really good so I thought it would work well and last a long time
248	neg	The mouse is heavy and feels very premium
248	neg	It works just fine without any programs or special drivers, but I recommend the GHUB program since you can customize the sensitivity more precisely
248	neg	I was a happy user until about 6 months in when the right click button started to not hold down
248	neg	This normally wasn't an issue, but during games where you hold right click to aim, it made them unplayable
248	neg	I got a replacement pretty quickly and didn't have any issues until about another 6 months later when it started having the same issue
248	neg	I submitted a request for another replacement (or just a refund) and it took them about a week to respond
248	neg	Ultimately, I just bought another Razer Deathadder (the V2 model this time), which is what I had before and is what worked fine for over 3 years
248	neg	While I believe the original G502 was of high-quality parts and should last for a long time, this new HERO model clearly has problems with the switches and I wouldn't recommend it due to its reliability issues
249	neg	Right-click does not hold consistently, frequently unpressing/pressing the button while you hold it down
249	neg	It gets a lot worse if you right-click and drag
249	neg	Unacceptable for any game that relies on this
249	neg	Both left and right click buttons will frequently double-click when you single-click
249	neg	Happens maybe 1 in 9-12 clicks that wind up double-clicking
249	neg	Awful for moments where double-click confirms, or when you mean to click+drag and it double-clicks instead
249	neg	Side buttons work most of the time, but occasionally don't register when you hear them click
249	neg	Pointer precision and response is good, it's ergonomic, wheel works (for me but I've read others having issues with it) - everything else with the mouse is fine
249	neg	But this is absolutely awful for gaming anything that requires left/right-click precision and consistency

250	pos	Este es el segundo Mouse G502 que tengo
250	pos	El primero lo compré inalámbrico, pero cuando llegó tenía cable
250	pos	Amazon me reembolsó la diferencia y me quedé con el mouse con cable
250	pos	El G502 con cable resultó tan bueno y el cable tan flexible y cómodo que no pensé más en comprar el inalámbricoDe hecho el segundo que he comprado tiene cable también y es excelente
250	pos	Los puntos principales que hacen este mouse especial es la rueda de desplazamiento, la cual es super cómoda, y rápida;  la iluminación y los colores
250	pos	Lo recomiendo
251	neg	Oh where do I begin
251	neg	I've had the proteus spectrum and logitech gaming software for years now
251	neg	Everything is working great
251	neg	GREAT MOUSE
251	neg	So naturally when I saw this one with the same form factor just "updated" I jumped on the lower price
251	neg	This mouse feels great in my hand and the weights are a great option to fit this thing just right
251	neg	****They recently moved away from LGS to some ghub TERRIBLE software
251	neg	Incredibly unintuitive and clunky to use
251	neg	***I want to map my modifier buttons (shift, alt, cntrl) to the side buttons where my thumb naturally falls, like I do with my proteus
251	neg	YOU CANT
251	neg	They will map on the software but they will not register on any application, not even a word document
251	neg	I called Logitech customer support and after being on a call for over an hour and a half with a guy that had a chicken cock-a-doodle-dooing every 15 seconds he had NOTHING to tell me
251	neg	So he escalated my call and said someone will call me back
251	neg	No call after 3 days
251	neg	Called back, pretty sure I got the same guy and he "emailed the escalation team and someone should get back to you shortly
251	neg	" It's been over a week now with no call back
251	neg	Worst customer service I've experienced in a long time
251	neg	The funny thing is, if you google this there are many, mannnny reports of this and even some logitech professionals that have worked on this same issue from a while ago
251	neg	Still no fix
251	neg	Save your money
251	neg	I'm returning
252	pos	This mouse is comfortable and precise
252	pos	The G glows too, and you can change the color
252	pos	My only complaint is the positioning of navigation buttons
252	pos	I accidentally click the back because it is located next to the thumb rest, but I'm pretty sure that can be disabled, and it is useful in some games
252	pos	Sometimes I bump the dpi setting buttons against the side of my keyboard if I run out of room, but that's on me for not allowing enough space
252	pos	Aside from that, it's everything I want in a mouse
252	pos	My favorite feature is the mouse wheel is unlockable
252	pos	You've got your normal clicky mouse wheel scrolling, but you can unlock it to make the wheel free-spinning
252	pos	This is extremely useful in any game with a semi-auto weapon and a high fire rate (faster than you can normally click)
252	pos	You can use mouse wheel down as an alternative input to fire weapon, and it turns into a Gatling gun
252	pos	Good times
253	pos	I wasn't sure i would like this mouse
253	pos	it looks kinda like a space ship so was worried a bit
253	pos	I had a corsair glave for years and really liked it and was worried that this smaller mouse would be hard for me to get used to
253	pos	after about 4 hours I started to get used to and love the mouse
253	pos	As i continue to use it i have only found one issue I often find the scroll wheel when unlocked zoom in a out in games (some games do different things just took one for example) so I only unlock it to scroll down where i lock it again
253	pos	really like the mouse wish I had gotten the wireless version honestly
254	neg	The G502 feels great in my hand
254	neg	The software isn't anything special, but it works fine
254	neg	I've bought Logitech mice for about 2 decades now and they've always done well for me until now
254	neg	This mouse has a design flaw
254	neg	You can see it in lots of other reviews here and I want to add my story to the list
254	neg	I'm on my second mouse
254	neg	Both were bought new
254	neg	The first I bought from Amazon, the second from Target
254	neg	The first mouse survived 6 months
254	neg	The second survived 4
254	neg	For me the failure mode has been if I hold down the left mouse button, it can randomly register multiple clicks while the button is held down
254	neg	If you're trying to highlight text that means killing your selection and starting a new one
254	neg	If you're moving a file it means dropping the file wherever happens to be when it decides you're not still holding the button, if you're playing a game, it can mean double spending on an attribute point or on a weapon that you hold to charge it can mean randomly shooting early
254	neg	This problem isn't limited to the left mouse button, I've seen it happen on the right button as well where it continually flipped me in and out of sniper mode in games
254	neg	It's a shame
254	neg	I really like the mouse when it works, but a $50 mouse should last longer than 5 months (the average for my 2 mice)
255	pos	Polybutene grip will melt eventually and get sticky
255	pos	Mouse raddles when I shake or tap it
255	pos	Sounds and looks cheap
255	pos	I would have returned it if it didnt have an unlockable scroll wheel and it was not on sale
255	pos	Its a $50 mouse wireless or not build quality wise
255	pos	Mouse tracks well but tends to reset its settings on reboot
255	pos	Logitech really wants is software running in the background
255	pos	Software functionality is OK but they want you to make an account to download comunity created profiles
255	pos	I will NOT
255	pos	Mouse wheel is highest quality part
255	pos	And stop putting nylon cables on things
255	pos	They get dirty and kink and frey
255	pos	They need to be literally be washed evetually
256	pos	i had a deathrzor chroma which felt off, then swapped over to the g402 and felt amazing
256	pos	and then again i swapped to the g502 (hero, although the difference is extremely small and you can barely tell) and it felt even better
256	pos	mouse is a bit heavy even with only 1 plate (im using none) and is on the slightly large size, but i have no problem griping it even with my medium-small sized hands
256	pos	software works great with it, and it feels a lot more responsive in games than other mice
256	pos	its also cool to have people look at it and get confused by the alien shape
256	pos	free scroll wheel is extremely satisfying and i find myself unlocking it every so often to play with it like a fidget spinner
256	pos	locked mode is quite solid
256	pos	the extra button is not as convenient due to its location, but i use it to cycle through various profiles instead
256	pos	definitely a 5/5
256	pos	the only downside i had with this mouse is that the top left 2 keys are a bit harder to reach as well as the one on the top, but i usually use them for the likes of music\volume controlls becasue the other 3 are more than enough
256	pos	in addition, pressing mb3 can be quite difficult with it moving to the sides all the time, but ive gotten into the habit of using left-tilt mb3 instead, and i find it a ton more comfortable to move it to the side instead of trying to press it
257	pos	Bought this mouse to replace my old Logitech laser mouse that has been with me through frag and fail
257	pos	It's going to take some time to getting used to the new mouse and sensitivity
257	pos	it's very sensitive
257	pos	It glides easier and is more responsive than my old mouse, which should be a good thing
257	pos	but I was used to the old guy and his failings
257	pos	The forward/back buttons on the side are situated a TAD bit different than my old mouse, but like I said, it's going to take some time
257	pos	I'm still grieving from the loss of such an solid soldier and hope this mouse can live up to it's namesake
258	pos	I have been using this mouse for FPS games such as Insurgency Sandstorm, Ground Branch, and Tarkov since Nov 2020
258	pos	I've been lucky so far with the mouse scroll wheel still working
258	pos	I use a mix between fingertip and palm grips
258	pos	The extra mouse buttons helps with secondary roles like switching optics and fire select modes
258	pos	Very comfortable mouse to use and the Logitech app is very easy to use and navigate
258	pos	Mouse clicks are light and with a positive tactile click
258	pos	I would recommend turning off mouse smoothing on both games and in mouse settings
259	pos	This is my second Logitech mouse, i try to stay with logitech because of software
259	pos	my logitech mouse left mouse pointer button slowly stopped registering input
259	pos	at first it was here and there then got worse and worse eventually i had to buy a new mouse
259	pos	Now i own the logitech hero 502 and after a little over a year it has begun doing the same thing
259	pos	I am very careful with my hardware, i still use a logitech G15 in 2020 which is i dont know how old at this point, well over 10 years
259	pos	but there seems to be a repeating issue with these Mice that isnt a cause of carelessness or neglect by user
259	pos	I hope logitech takes a look at the mouse mechanical button situation and improves on it
260	neg	This review if for the Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Gaming Mouse
260	neg	Purchased this mouse a year ago
260	neg	Mouse has a great build quality, works well, feels good in the hand and is very responsive
260	neg	The software is easy to use and navigate
260	neg	I really like the mouse but days after I purchased it, the right mouse button was intermittent and not consistent(I'm not hard on my hardware and treat it with care)
260	neg	I use the mouse for a variety of applications but for gaming and FPS type games, a intermittent right click is not good
260	neg	All the other buttons work well and I like the click and response  of the buttons and the mouse as a whole, but not having a right mouse button that is reliable isn't good
261	pos	I bought one for my gaming setup and a week later got one for my brother
261	pos	This is just a great mouse for gaming and productivity
261	pos	You can save different profiles to the mouse and switch between them depending on what you are doing
261	pos	I have a gaming profile for my most played game and one for work with quick shortcuts to enhance efficiency
261	pos	The hyperscroll wheel is a beast at helping get through long PDFs and Excel files at work
261	pos	Also being able to switch sensitivity on the fly comes in handy too
261	pos	This has been a great addition to both mine and my brother's pc setup
262	neg	Nice mouse all in all
262	neg	More buttons than I've found uses for yet, highly programmable
262	neg	Better fit than most mice for large hands, but a perfectly sized mouse would still be a bit longer
262	neg	Down side, when I add the included weights to it, the magnetic panel on the bottom can't close
262	neg	The weights seem to have permanent fingerprint smudges on them that I can't wipe off, haven't tried cleaning solution and likely won't since they don't fit in the mouse anyways
262	neg	8/10/20 Update: I bought this mouse because my last one was double-clicking all the time
262	neg	Just over 1 year after purchase, this mouse is doing the same thing
262	neg	I'm really disappointed in Logitech with this mouse
262	neg	Their wireless mice that come with a keyboard typically last 3-4 times longer in my experience
262	neg	I now have to clear my schedule for an evening to disassemble this mouse and hope I can bend the spring back into shape so it doesn't double click every time I try to click once
263	pos	I love this mouse
263	pos	I have used many gaming mice: mad catz RAT 6, razer ouroboros, and corsair dark core
263	pos	All have been great mice but needed to be replaced over time from use
263	pos	This mouse is really nice
263	pos	Feels great and works well
263	pos	Pros:- Free/ locked scroll wheel is nice- Fully customizable buttons ( in software )- Rgb is not obnoxious- separate weights to customize for your mouse- great price when on saleCons:- for large hands my pinky has no where to sit but to hit the mouse pad ( most of my other mice have had a curve or plate to place my pinky)- no detachable wire / not usb c
264	pos	I have had the G502 since it has been released and have really loved mine
264	pos	Still works amazingly after now many many years
264	pos	These mice provided you don't nerd rage too much are fit for great longevity
264	pos	However the first gen of the G502 certainly had some quirks, mostly no RGB and the sensor always felt just a little bit off
264	pos	Now with the newwer G502 Hero, they have made the G502 essentially flawless
264	pos	The new mouse is basically flawless
264	pos	No issues with the sensor, rgb, or anything
264	pos	The only flaw left is that some people may want a wireless version and they even sell that now
264	pos	I'd be surprised if anyone is on the edge with this mouse, it's entirely worth buying
265	pos	Own a bunch of Logitech mice with the free wheel spinning feature, the problem with the G502 is that free wheel is a little TOO free
265	pos	The free wheel feature on Logitech's other mice (M705, MX Anywhere 2/2S, MX Master 3) won't move on it's own or rattle as bad when you flick your mouse around (the wheel is going to rattle a little with any mouse that has the free wheel feature), on the G502 is particularly bad
265	pos	Sometimes when I scroll down, stop the wheel and start moving the mouse around it would scroll up or down on it's own
265	pos	The grip on the wheel is quite bad too compared to Logitech's other mice I've used that have a rubber track around the wheel for better grip
265	pos	Other than this one negative, it's a great mouse overall
266	pos	This mouse will randomly move the cursor on it's own, so in a game you may experience random spinning, looking up, and looking down
266	pos	Gets very frustrating too getting into a gun fight and having this mouse screw you over
266	pos	Also had my key binds not work at all
266	pos	Pretty small mouse and quite heavy for the size
266	pos	Also if you have larger hands, this may not be the mouse for you
266	pos	It seems well built, but seems to have software and sensor issues
266	pos	The button layout on the side is kind of bad, you will have to reach for the bigger button because the forward and back buttons are set back
266	pos	The larger button is a bit too tall
266	pos	Sometimes the scroll wheel lags, currently have it set to switch weapons and sometimes doesn't switch right away
266	pos	I own the Corsair Scimitar and it performs flawlessly
266	pos	Wanted this mouse because the forward and back buttons are bigger and also for the left and right scroll wheel buttons
267	pos	I've owned 4 gaming mice to date
267	pos	Coolermaster, Steelseries, Razer, and another Logitech (this one is still alive +8 years)
267	pos	So even though I'm not an expert because I know there are people who have owned or tested more gaming mice I have enough experience to know if a mouse is garbage or not
267	pos	Pros:- Buttons
267	pos	LOTS OF BUTTONS
267	pos	- I love Logitech's software, so much better than Steelseries in my opinion- This mouse is very precise and accurate- The click
267	pos	The click this mouse produces is so much better than other mice I've owned
267	pos	- Adjustable weight- This mouse is heavier than some of my other mice but somehow the weight is distributed better
267	pos	Cons:- The weight, yes, I know I stated it's weight is distributed very well
267	pos	However, the mouse could've been a 5 star for me if they could chomp a few grams off
267	pos	I highly recommend this mouse and to be honest any other mouse made by Logitech they're really good quality products and they're built to last
268	pos	This mouse was great, until it started having a left click problem
268	pos	Occasionally when using left click it sets off several rapid clicks at once, and would do the same when the mouse button is held
268	pos	No problem I thought, this has a 2 year warranty
268	pos	Except there is a problem
268	pos	Their support policies imply their customers are automatically dishonest and put a large burden on their customers to prove otherwise
268	pos	Aside from standard troubleshooting steps I was asked to go to a website to test the mouse clicker, no problem
268	pos	It was registering plenty of extra clicks
268	pos	Then I continued reading, and saw they wanted video evidence which met certain requirements:"Video needs to show the website on the screen and the mouse (physically and not just the cursor) together with a handwritten note of the ticket number at the same time
268	pos	"This blew my mind
268	pos	They wanted me to do this while recording it all with my phone
268	pos	So I express my dissatisfaction with this and note that not everyone even has the means to do this, took a screenshot of the website and attached it
268	pos	This convinced the agent to go ahead and replace the mouse anyway, but even so the additional demands are frustrating
268	pos	I am being asked to destroy the product and provide photo evidence before they send the replacement
268	pos	So I have a mouse that is frustrating to use but at least it is better than no mouse, and they want me to destroy it before they send me a replacement
268	pos	I'll have no mouse for days
268	pos	The requirements for the evidence:Before the replacement product will be released, we request that you permanently disable your current product in a safe manner and provide us with pictures of the complete, disabled product from three different angles, one of these pictures should clearly show the product details such as PID/SN, and include a handwritten note with your case number (XXXXXXX) in each of the photos
268	pos	I again expressed my dissatisfaction and that I need to use the mouse until the new one arrives
268	pos	If I end up having to do this I'll be buying a new mouse from a company with better support before I follow through with disabling the mouse and getting the replacement I should have already gotten
268	pos	EDIT: The agent went ahead and shipped the new mouse without requiring evidence of disabling the old mouse
268	pos	I could have waited a day to see their response but I was pretty frustrated
268	pos	While it is a shame I had to complain to get around these requirements they still accommodated me, so I've given back 3 stars for a 4 star rating
268	pos	Not counting my experience with customer support I would have given this mouse 5 stars
269	pos	I've owned this mouse for about a month or so now and haven't had any issue yet
269	pos	I've got pretty big hands and this mouse feels great to me
269	pos	All the buttons are easy to reach without feeling like I have to stretch or pull my hand back
269	pos	The ghub software is easy enough to work with
269	pos	It didn't take me more than a few minutes to get the buttons assigned how I wanted them
269	pos	Also, I've noticed a few reviews that complain that the scroll wheel "breaks" and keeps on spinning
269	pos	There is literally a button below the scroll wheel that changes the scroll wheel mode between standard scrolling and infinite scrolling
269	pos	If you think your scroll wheel "broke", just hit the button
269	pos	Some people have complained about double clicking developing over time
269	pos	I haven't had the mouse long enough to get that problem, but if it ever does I'll come back to edit this review
269	pos	Overall, nothing but positive feedback from me
269	pos	I don't think you'll find a better mouse at this price point
270	pos	Got it for the amount of buttons and was surprised by the level of customization
270	pos	Equally surprised was how quickly the bloody thing start double clicking - 2 months
270	pos	Was very annoyed and disappointed until figured out how to replace the switches to Japanese ones
270	pos	Not terribly difficult, just extra work and cost for no reason - $3-10 extra
270	pos	All in all works fine now, but Logitech need to get its sources together; Chinese switches are garbage
271	pos	I'm on my third mouse, I'm too spoiled with the functionality of these gaming mice Logitec has
271	pos	The button setup on the G502 is so easy to hit with your index and thumb
271	pos	The only issues that make these unreliable, is there is a defect that causes the left click to double click
271	pos	So dragging windows, or playing games etc
271	pos	can be frustrating at times
271	pos	There are ways to self fix it, but it requires opening the mouse, which I wont do
271	pos	They are cost effective though and I've only had this defect happen once
272	pos	I had been looking at more costly alternatives for some time
272	pos	I had many mice before this one, but I have to say that this one has won the gold medal so far
272	pos	I have set my dpi to 450 with ease and usually, that remains so, though some issues with the software have had me go change it back through the time I have had it over all this is not a big issue
272	pos	The quality feels nice, the clickiness is responsive, the setup is economical, and the bottoms are efficient
272	pos	Definitely consider this mouse for shooters
273	pos	I love this little guy
273	pos	I love the ability to switch to different dpi on the spot or its ability to work on almost all surfaces — including bed sheets with lines on them or glass surfaces
273	pos	My only wish/want was that there were more areas this mouse could light up with RGB
273	pos	It’s just a couple of spots, sadly
273	pos	Also, the profiles can have a hard time sticking and being saved
273	pos	This can be a bit frustrating with having to adjust your options every so often
273	pos	I love the response and action on the buttons
273	pos	I especially love the ergonomic positioning of the additional buttons and the ability to program all the buttons to macros or keyboard strokes
273	pos	If you’re looking for a little bit of flair with your mouse and the ability to customize your buttons exactly as you want, this mouse is a great option for competitive and MMO gaming
273	pos	Just a little more light in the next revision
273	pos	Please
274	pos	I love my Logitech mice and this one performs very well too
274	pos	The software is simple and it tracks great on my mouse pad
274	pos	I would be great for gaming or detailed editing work
274	pos	My main problem with this mouse is that it is too small for most grown men or adults who would wear size large gloves
274	pos	This negates any ergonomic benefits because you have to grip it incorrectly
274	pos	If you have large hands and ergonomics are important to you, I would suggest looking for something larger
275	neg	I had to return this twice to amazon since they both came in used, so I bought mine elsewhere but this is a review of the product and not amazon
275	neg	The mouse itself has good build quality, crisp clicks and a good amount of programmable buttons
275	neg	A nice touch is the infinite scroll wheel ability, but I do not like the side to side feature of the middle mouse button
275	neg	This causes the middle mouse button to rattle when moving your mouse quickly and it feels off
275	neg	Another major issue for me is the weight, it is way heavy for an FPS mouse
275	neg	Finally, the ergonomics is very counter intuitive
275	neg	The sniper button is way too close to the thumb, and the left grips follow the shape of the thumb, which is what you don't want as it can slip out of your hand easily
275	neg	I am a palm mouse gamer and this is definitely not suited for palm
276	neg	Everything about this mouse is 1st class except the scroll wheel
276	neg	The wheel is extremely well made but it is solid metal and slippery
276	neg	I have to press down pretty hard to keep it from slipping
276	neg	This means no middle mouse button
276	neg	If Logitech were to use the wheel from the 903 this would be the perfect mouse
276	neg	Update 11/30/2020: I could not live with it any longer and ordered a new mouse
276	neg	The G502 is fantastic but the mouse wheel makes it very difficult to use
276	neg	It is just too slippery
276	neg	For normal browsing it is fine but for anything requiring precision it does not work
276	neg	This is especially problematic when gaming
277	pos	The mouse is a bit smaller than I expected and some of the button locations make it really easy to hit buttons you didn't mean to
277	pos	I like the adjustable weights
277	pos	I was much happier with the size when I found a good weight for me
277	pos	The software, G-Hub is hot garbage
277	pos	It's 50/50 whether it detects a program launch if you have a profile set up for that program
277	pos	Setting up custom binds is pretty straightforward, but not simple
277	pos	I had trouble getting some key combinations working as expected
277	pos	The RGB lighting is also a little confusing to set up and doesn't integrate with HP/Omen RGB controls
277	pos	That's disappointing
278	pos	Bought this as a replacement for a G500 that did good service for about 9 years until a spring failed and it started double-clicking randomly
278	pos	I bought a Steelseries Rival 5 based on reviews, and let me tell you, it's a piece of junk next to this G502
278	pos	Not only did the Steelseries Rival 5 lock up randomly when connected to my KVM switch (a problem I've never had with a Logitech mouse), it also had generally inferior build quality and was missing the free-spin button for the mouse wheel
278	pos	Overall this is a great mouse
278	pos	Very happy
279	neg	I loved the feel of the mouse
279	neg	It fit my hand well
279	neg	I liked being able to adjust the weight of the mouse
279	neg	The software was alright
279	neg	My largest complaint is I bought my original mouse about 1
279	neg	5 years ago
279	neg	I had to RMA it about 8 months in because my right and left mouse clicks were having problems
279	neg	The replacement I have is experiencing the same problems now about 7 months later
279	neg	I do not play games nearly as much as I used to
279	neg	My previous Logitech mice lasted years of heavy gaming for hours each day before experiencing the same issues
279	neg	Disappointed at the quality
279	neg	I'll be trying a different brand to see if it lasts longer than 7 months
280	pos	A decent mouse for the money, lots of buttons
280	pos	For normal computer use, it's outstanding
280	pos	My one complaint with it applies to every single gaming mouse I've ever used:  the mouse wheel doesn't have enough resistance, so when you use it as a button while gaming, it tends to roll forward or backward too, which has unintended consequences in 99% of games
280	pos	It'd be nice if just ONE manufacturer made a stiffer wheel, or a special lock button for it
281	pos	I had a logitech mouse a long time ago, and it was amazing, as was the customer service when it eventually broke
281	pos	When it was time to get a new mouse I tried various brands over the years
281	pos	HyperX, Corsair,  Razer, and a couple others of the most popular brands which I don’t remember
281	pos	Nope
281	pos	Logitech makes solid gaming mice
281	pos	This is the best gaming mouse I’ve owned since My last logitech mouse
281	pos	It just feels good
281	pos	At this point, I think I will only buy logitech mice for the rest of my life
281	pos	Just nothing but quality
282	pos	Wish the mouse wheel had a firmer scroll when it's not on the option of free flow
282	pos	And it kind of clunks the top most weight around when I make a flick da wrissss
282	pos	Just a noise though, not an actual problem
282	pos	Definetely took my accuracy in games, and put it where it should have been this whole time
282	pos	Use to miss shots all the time because my 10$ wireless mouse obviously didn't have the hero sensor
282	pos	Got use to the extra buttons over time and it's made fortnites building concept more convienent for me
282	pos	And the software is easy to learn from Logitech
282	pos	Programming buttons on the mouse to act as other keys from the keyboard, or even multi-key shortcuts
282	pos	Plus the 3 different profiles in the programming option makes it easy to switch from my fortnite dpi, to my casual internet browsing dpi, as well as my button lay out being different on all 4 profiles
282	pos	Totally worth the 80$
282	pos	But if you're on a budget, and need to see that extra 30 bucks, the previous version is going to be practically the exact same thing
282	pos	Enjoy
282	pos	Because you are buying this mouse
282	pos	😉
283	neg	I've been using this mouse for 1
283	neg	5 years now
283	neg	Worked great in the beginning but just got worse over time
283	neg	For a while it wasn't switching to the correct profile for the game I launched so I'd have to manually switch it but that behavior eventually stopped, I assume after updates
283	neg	For the last four months or so, it will randomly change the DPI under the different profiles I created
283	neg	Not happy with this thing and will be shopping around for something else
284	neg	Rated 50 million clicks my butt
284	neg	There's no way any of these mice would have passed that test unless shortcuts were taken
284	neg	Like many have posted here, after a while the mouse starts clicking 10 times for every 1 click you do
284	neg	It starts to effect both left and right clicking
284	neg	I can't even drag files on my comp anymore because it drops them or opens them up because it's registering me clicking 80 times
284	neg	-_- As advise, I heard that the model before the G502 Hero didn't suffer the same click issues
284	neg	They must have gone with a cheaper manufacturer
284	neg	I used to have a Logitech headset as well (G930/$115) and it died just as quickly
284	neg	I won't be buying anymore Logitech products anymore
284	neg	They are as crappy and short lasting as Razer
285	pos	I've been using a cheap $5 mouse for years
285	pos	Has it gotten the job done
285	pos	Sure, it's worked just fine
285	pos	But this is a serious upgrade and it's well worth every penny spent
285	pos	It has huge configurability with the buttons, which is a definite plus but one I am least likely to fully utilize
285	pos	The big benefit to me is the adjustable weights
285	pos	That is absolutely huge and a factor that I hardly ever considered
285	pos	Additionally, having the native ability to switch mouse sensitivity on the fly is amazing
285	pos	Overall, this mouse is incredible and there is nothing so far I can report to dislike about it
285	pos	Highly recommended
286	pos	It's a Logitech mouse, so it seems to be sturdy and functions well so far
286	pos	I've had it for 3 days now and only have 2 problems
286	pos	First is the size, it's the new "normal" (smaller) size mouse that doesn't fit as well in larger hands, can't see this in the pictures
286	pos	Second is the mouse wheel spins freely
286	pos	This is neat for scrolling through long pages quickly, but I haven't found anything else that the usual stiffer mouse wheel isn't better for
286	pos	But watch out using this "gaming" mouse for gaming, unless you want to be zooming in/out or swapping weapons constantly
286	pos	UPDATE: Turns out there's a button on it to stiffen the mouse wheel to not spin freely
286	pos	The only documentation with the mouse is the warning in about 20 languages, an ad, and the "instructions" with a picture of the usb cable and a usb port telling you how to plug it in
286	pos	Otherwise, it's a great mouse
286	pos	If you don't have larger hands then the size probably won't be an issue for you, but be warned about the scroll wheel before you make your decision
286	pos	Definetely still worth the money
287	neg	I play a browser based game called diep
287	neg	io
287	neg	its high action and you are constantly aiming the cursor at enemy tanks
287	neg	There is no time the cursor is not moving on this game
287	neg	For some reason my G502 wired mouse pauses slightly were i have to pick the mouse up and set it back down
287	neg	Its horrible for diep
287	neg	io since the slightest pause of the mouse cursor in the wrong spot could be instant death
287	neg	Ive been changing settings and trying everything I can
287	neg	But I'm to the point I want to return it
287	neg	Hoping the wireless version might be better
287	neg	Or maybe just a faulty wired version
287	neg	Whoo knows but I feel like throwing the damn thing into the wall when I get to level 45 and get killed cause my mouse stops and the precision shooting is compromised
287	neg	UHGThe reason for two starts is the mouse works great for everything else
288	pos	The G502 series are the top-selling mice on planet Earth (I dunno about other places)
288	pos	This member of the 502 family, the Logitech G502 HERO, takes a great mouse (G502 Proteus Spectrum RGB Tunable) with a great heritage (G502 Proteus Core) and makes it even greater
288	pos	The HERO sensor offers even sharper tracking of your smallest input (up to 16,000 DPI vs 12,000) and OMRON switches for ludicrous durability (50M vs
288	pos	10M)
288	pos	The Logitech G502 mice have always offered excellent balance between feature set, material & build quality, recognizable branding, and fair pricing
288	pos	Why should I pay more or settle for less
288	pos	Why would you
288	pos	(I am a non-affiliated customer/fan)
289	pos	This thing is pretty darn good
289	pos	Rock solid construction
289	pos	Very responsive without being touchy
289	pos	Able to set the G keys to be any key I want them to be
289	pos	Easy to do macros for gaming
289	pos	DPI settings can go as high as you need to have full movement on screen with minimal movement on the mousepad
289	pos	Im going to be ordering 3 or 4 more of these because I hate having to learn a new mouse if it goes bad later on down the road
289	pos	I doubt it will fail any time soon cause I have a G13 game pad from Logitech and its been working perfectly for the past 6 years
290	pos	Great mouse with one serious design flaw
290	pos	After several months of use, left mouse button starts to register multiple click even though only one click pressed
290	pos	This can be very frustrating when you need do an drag function, like dragging files to different folder or highlighted text
290	pos	This is a well known issue that has been forward to logitech and I'm hoping they fixed this defect in their newer release because ignoring the defect, this mouse is quite good
291	pos	I spent a ton of time researching a new high DPI gaming mouse for my setup
291	pos	I even went as far as visiting local stores to ensure that the mouse works with my hand
291	pos	Mice and keyboards are one of the most subjective items to rate or recommend, because everyone has different tastes
291	pos	As a result, I think it's worth taking the time to visit a shop that will allow you to demo what you're looking for
291	pos	Once you figure that out, and want something that's great for claw gripping, and versatile enough to match other styles, look no further (unless you have a crazy budget and can afford the light speed wireless version)
291	pos	The only downside is that the software is required if you want any of the features
291	pos	This is not an issue if you have a modern computer with enough RAM
291	pos	However, if you have an aversion to background programs, maybe look for something that doesn't require software (Steel Series)
292	neg	This is my second G502 Hero mouse
292	neg	I've bought 2 of these things because I've been a life-long Logitech fan
292	neg	This mouse is amazing, until it isn't
292	neg	With both of the mouses, the left and right click would release randomly while I would have the button pressed down
292	neg	Making it impossible to aim in FPS titles
292	neg	At first I thought it was just a bad mouse the first time, but when I got a second one the same exact thing happened
292	neg	Something is wrong with the build quality or the parts they use inside of this mouse
292	neg	It worked great for a couple of months, and then the problems started
292	neg	Shop somewhere else
293	neg	The mouse itself seems fine
293	neg	It's reasonably comfortable and adjustable weight
293	neg	There are some production issues where it ends up double clicking but Logitech will do replacements on them
293	neg	The problem is the Logitech G Hub is absolute garbage software
293	neg	Apparently Razer is pretty bad too but good god this thing sucks
293	neg	Unfortunately you have to use it to store profiles and things and it is crap
293	neg	Issues I've had include losing profiles, not switching profiles, hanging on firmware updates, graphical problems in the software, crashes, and just a general terrible UI and UX design
293	neg	Don't count on future updates fixing the software either as I've had this mouse for over a year and it's a crapshoot whether a software update will make things worse or not
293	neg	So yeah
293	neg	The mouse is fine, the software is crap
293	neg	I'm considering getting something different and never going back to logitech sadly
294	neg	I've purchased this thing for 3 times in a Row, I've been a fan of Logitech products for years but I guess this is the end
294	neg	This thing will let you down with double click issues within the first or second month of use, so you better look something else, save your money
295	pos	Its 4 star, would I get it again
295	pos	No
295	pos	Cons:-The mouse wheel is ridiculous, it spins like crazy, I struggle to model 3d or animate anything with this mouse, like just a touch and your camera/scroll is all the way up or down, so I'm at odds
295	pos	(I rarely use the mouse wheel for gaming, but if you do, that's just you, haha
295	pos	)-Programmable almost perfect but I'd like a triple click button for gaming, its possible, I just have to do some coding, and that's just the problem, I don't want to code at this point in my life, I just need a mouse, there's a limited set of options to program, the people need more options, so my advice, is just get a mouse with a x3 click option or whatever specific thing you've experienced with the mouse you trying to replacePro:- It feels great, great enough to get past the cons, especially if a mouse wheel from the fast and furious is your thing
295	pos	-Its RGB lit with a minimal design
295	pos	so your thumb could cover all fancy custom light settings
296	pos	Compare against several Razer mice and other Logitech mice, this is my favorite for gaming
296	pos	Ergonomics are perfect(assuming you don't need it to be ambidextrous)
296	pos	Three thumb keys and two extra index finger keys are perfect for assigning vital actions in a game
296	pos	Adjustable sensitivity
296	pos	Smooth or lock to click scroll wheel is a must have in every mouse
296	pos	I have three(one for my PC, one for guest PC, and one for work machine in office)
296	pos	The first one is probably 3-4 years old now and still works perfectly
296	pos	Highly recommend getting the Razer hardtop/plastic mouse pad with this
296	pos	It doesn't work with Chroma, but it's butter smooth and never frays like a fabric pad would
297	pos	To put it simply, this mouse seems perfectly fine in terms of form and function
297	pos	I haven't had any noticeable issue with buttons and software or tracking, regardless of application
297	pos	The only issue is that the design of the mouse makes it some what annoying to clean
297	pos	Besides the crevices that are all over the place, especially around the buttons, the sides also have textured rubbery grips
297	pos	Dirt and grime and accumulate within the textured triangles and can be very annoying to clean unless you are wiping it down daily
298	pos	I had the first gen G602 before this and the only thing that ended up failing on that was the left click, but that was after about 4+ years of constant use
298	pos	This mouse is identical to that one with an RGB light(which I just disable anyway) and a slightly different colour scheme for the removeable cover for the weights
298	pos	But this mouse is absolutely perfect for me
298	pos	The thumb wrest on the side is perfect
298	pos	The thumb buttons are also in a really good place, I never find myself accidently hitting any or finding I can't reach one, with the exception of the button furthest forward, but I never use that anyway
298	pos	Also the smooth scroll is great for scrolling through long websites light twitter or the like
298	pos	As someone who has had a version of this mouse for years and have had no issues with this one, I definitely recommend this too anyone looking for a good mouse
299	neg	Seems like a nice mouse
299	neg	Has software/hardware issues
299	neg	G logic software won’t recognize my mouse unless I uninstall software, and plug in the mouse as I open the software again
299	neg	Restarting my PC resets this
299	neg	This makes me not be able to control my DPI
299	neg	I play CS GO and the dpi mouse settings are placed in such a bad area, without being able to lock out settings, I constantly accidentally change my dpi settings
299	neg	Super annoying
299	neg	Returning
300	pos	This is the best mouse I've ever used
300	pos	hands down
300	pos	for productivity, for gaming, anything
300	pos	The sensor on this thing is so amazing - I've used even other gaming mice, some more expensive than this, and this sensor blows them out of the water, I think likely due to the frequency at which it communicates with the computer (which is 1000 times per second)
300	pos	the mouse is just so precise - aiming in video games is much steadier, and it helps me so much with productivity because i can move the mouse so quickly and not overshoot whatever I'm trying to click
300	pos	it's also ergonomically so comfortable - my hands are quite large (can easily reach 10ths on a piano if that means anything to you), so a lot of mice feel a bit small to me
300	pos	This mouse's shape somehow fits my hand comfortably, and the rubber sides make for a very nice grip
300	pos	there's some extra things that aren't crucial to me but are nice, such as the RGB, adjustable weights, and scroll wheel free/notched toggle, but they're certainly appreciated
300	pos	tldr: this mouse is the one
301	pos	This mice is just so comfortable to hold in my hand
301	pos	I'm switching from the G900, which sadly broke from my recent move and I lost its side button pieces, which I needed for a game function
301	pos	Having the option to have more than 2 extra programmable buttons never appealed to me before, but now with the particular game I'm playing, it just makes my life easier
301	pos	The grip on the mice is perfect for me, I can move this thing on my entire pad without a break, smoothly
301	pos	It just glides
301	pos	Another thing never appealed to me was the weights
301	pos	I never understood its purpose, until I had the option to have them
301	pos	I popped them all in, and played around with the mouse for an hour or two, and honestly, I like it more than I thought I would
301	pos	They're staying in
301	pos	If you're for some reason a new Logitech user, be sure to download the Logitech Gaming Software to program the buttons and lighting effects
302	pos	I've always loved Logitech products and peripherals, from headphones to mousepads, so when I saw this one on sale for half the regular list price, I knew I had to jump on it
302	pos	Like any good gaming mouse you can customize the weights in the bottom compartment, it's soft and pleasant material, features a ton of customizable buttons and DPI control as well as the free scroll mechanic (both hilarious and useful for someone like me who frequently works on and edits VERY long documents)
302	pos	Customizable color RGB through the G Hub app as well
302	pos	Gaming feels like a breeze with everything more precise, the buttons more responsive, and a clear rise in quality from my last model
302	pos	I recommend this mouse to anyone who prefers a wired model and is looking for something to game with
303	neg	I've been using the G500 series for several years now and replaced an older G502 with this new one
303	neg	It seems that Logitech's quality has slipped
303	neg	There is an issue with the motion sensor on this mouse that causes the cursor/character to stick when turning while having the right mouse button clicked/depressed
303	neg	I have cleaned the mouse, cleaned the mouse pad, swapped out mouse pads, and the issue persists
303	neg	Not to mention at one point the G500 series mouse were easily configurable, DPS and button wise
303	neg	But now the new G Hub software has you locked and the presets for the various games aren't what I want
303	neg	Editing of the built in profiles seems to be unavailable
304	pos	Sensor is not bad, even if there are better out there in 2022
304	pos	Quality of material, for the price, its more than acceptable
304	pos	Ergonomics, this mouse is mostly for PALM grip
304	pos	IF you have any other type of grip style, I would stay away
304	pos	Big cons IMO, the scroll wheel is absolute garbage
304	pos	Possibly the worst I have ever experienced on a mouse above $20 bucks
304	pos	Buttons do not feel solid in any way
304	pos	QC just isn't there IMO
305	pos	This is probably the best mouse I ever used
305	pos	Although it has more buttons than the previous mouse I bought, but I did prefer the layout of the buttons more than this one
305	pos	I feel this mouse is ideal for shooters while the one I used prior was more rounded to almost any mouse I used
305	pos	That being said, this mouse has weights that give it a heavier feel which I love
305	pos	The other mouse was very light weighted and felt cheap
305	pos	This is built like a brick and works amazingly
305	pos	16000dpi is beyond what I have ever felt for a mouse so I keep mine around 4000dpi
305	pos	It gives a nice speed to the mouse
305	pos	Lastly the mouse is fully custom with lighting with full rgb
305	pos	Custom buttons and uses the new Ghub software
305	pos	Although I feel that logitech has some issues in their software dept
305	pos	So far this has been really great
306	neg	I used it for two weeks and found that right button would always work, so for that allow I returned it
306	neg	Can say I really liked it beyond that anyways
306	neg	The dpi buttons are in a bad places as I was always hitting one with my left figure and the adjustment of dpi was bad
306	neg	I the slowest was far to slow for me and the next up was to fast, so I could get it in a comfortable place
306	neg	The design of the mouse is not great as it is rounded on the right side so I was always lifting the mouse when moving right and losing movement on screen
306	neg	Also if you don't have anything but a small hand the mouse is most liekly going to be to small for you
306	neg	Overall can't say I really liked anything about as even the look is kind of ugly
307	neg	Bought the mouse back in May 2019, noticed issues with the right mouse button within 3 months
307	neg	Potentially a firmware issue, could be hardware, but regardless its common in this mouse and will come up with a quick google search
307	neg	Most noticeable is that the right mouse button will bounce when pressed
307	neg	This will manifest in either the mouse double clicking with a single press, or not being able to maintain a held press without registering additional clicks
307	neg	For gaming, this makes the mouse completely unreliable - You will not be able to confidently ADS in fps games, and you will not be able to pan your screen in games with right click drag
307	neg	The quality of the mouse switches do not live up to the rest of the mouse - every other feature has been great,but at the end of the day I need a mouse that can right click
307	neg	I would not recommend this mouse to anyone, and would point instead to the Razer Basilisk, which was built to profit off the success of this mouse ironically, but has access to optical sensors and Razer build quality
308	neg	I have had this mouse for almost a year and a half and am now experiencing an issue where single clicking results in multiple clicks on my left mouse button
308	neg	It won't stay pressed which makes highlighting text and dragging across the screen impossible and infuriating
308	neg	This is not the first time I've had issues with Logitech mice
308	neg	Will not be purchasing them ever again
308	neg	Positives: Comfortable to hold, weighty, nice to the touch, cool lights, lots of features
308	neg	If it didn't have this issue, this would be a 5 star product
309	neg	Purchased on August 7, 2020, writing review on July 30, 2020
309	neg	This mouse served me well for about 6 months
309	neg	after that, it started acting up with some random double-clicking and click+hold interruption
309	neg	While its prime it was a great mouse as the software that accompanies it is quite handy with customizable DPI for different applications and quite a large range of choice, but I call it quits today when my automatic fire click and hold was interrupted several times in the same game causing me to lose two perfectly good ambushes in Siege
309	neg	Great mouse, just be ready to shill out another 50 every 6 months to a year maybe
310	pos	First off, just going to vent about QC:First mouse I got the lights stopped working after about a month
310	pos	Second mouse had two issues, the right click button sometimes double clicks so if I am scoping in playing any FPS game, it will scope out or jitter
310	pos	Super annoying
310	pos	The second issue is the pad on the bottom of the mouse kept getting caught  on my mouse pad
310	pos	Must have been poorly placed or something
310	pos	Like a tiny piece of the plastic sticks outwards and scratches the mouse pad
310	pos	Using the mouse:I want to preface this by saying I use palm grip
310	pos	If you use claw grip you might have different (better) results
310	pos	Anyway the ergonomics are actually trash
310	pos	Some of the "extra" buttons are too easy to accidentally press
310	pos	This happens from time to time when you are playing games and your arm gets stiff and you adjust your grip
310	pos	Boom accidentally touched like 4 buttons
310	pos	The biggest offenders are the left and right mouse-3 inputs (where you tilt the mouse wheel in one direction) and the 3rd mouse button on the side
310	pos	The 2 extra buttons on the left mouse button are just too out of reach of the index finger
310	pos	Definitely have better experience using those buttons with claw grip
310	pos	Conclusion:Unfortunately at this price point you won't find much else that is better
310	pos	The only other ones are just random Chinese products that have low quality sensors, even if they look flashy
310	pos	Hence my 3-star review
310	pos	Thanks for reading
311	neg	I purchased this device for my gaming PC to have a quality gaming mouse
311	neg	I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase
311	neg	The mouse will randomly disconnect while I am in the middle of using it
311	neg	I originally thought it could possibly be my USB ports on my PC or something of the sort, but after trying to use it on another computer the problem continued
311	neg	The mouse will disconnect for about a second from my computer and reconnect again right after, but in the middle of gaming that is not acceptable
311	neg	The mouse feels amazing in your hand and is easy to control using the Logitech application, but if the product disconnects like it is, it cannot be used for gaming
312	pos	I’ve been looking for a nice gaming mouse, and if you are too, you can click Add to Cart
312	pos	The Logitech G502 Hero works absolute wonders
312	pos	For starters, the weight customization is amazing
312	pos	You can change how heavy the mouse is to fit your own needs, and it comes with plenty of extra weights
312	pos	It has bright LED’s on the mouse, which can be customized for different colours and effects
312	pos	There are 3 buttons on the left side of the mouse, for the thumb; 2 buttons next to the LMB; and one button in the middle (besides the scroll lock)
312	pos	It has a nice clicking sound and it’s easy to click fast on it
312	pos	It connects to the computer via a braided usb cable
312	pos	It also has a very nice scroll wheel, and overall it feels very sturdy and well-made
312	pos	Now about the software
312	pos	Logitech GHub is a simple install for this, and it is very user friendly
312	pos	You can make macros, shortcuts, change lighting, and remap buttons on the mouse with ease
312	pos	You can also sync the lighting to your Logitech Keyboard
312	pos	I have had no issues with it thus far, and it is likely my favourite accessory to my computer
312	pos	Now compatibility
312	pos	I am using a 2019 Macbook Pro, and the mouse works with all features
312	pos	It does not lose any features compared to Windows, which occurs with many mice
312	pos	TL;DR-Pros•Well-made•Weight customization•Easy and fast clicking•Remappable Buttons•LED Customization•Fantastic software•Perfect compatibility with Macbooks-Cons•I can’t give it a six star rating
313	neg	Another casualty of war
313	neg	I purchased this mouse in April 2020 and now it's the end of January 2021
313	neg	Just under a year old and the double click/click and drag fail has begun
313	neg	From what I've gathered, it's a well known hardware issue that pertains to the switches
313	neg	The problem is clicking, holding and dragging
313	neg	The click releases and then clicks again while dragging
313	neg	There's been posts of customer's having this problem right out of the box
313	neg	The only way to resolve it is by ordering different switches, voiding your warranty, and attempting to replace them yourself
313	neg	The mouse feels good and the option to add weight is nice but not necessary
313	neg	I like the RGB and extra buttons but the mouse wheel feels a bit derpy
313	neg	I did end up getting used to that though
313	neg	What you can't get used to is the broken primary and secondary buttons releasing while click holding
313	neg	Someone on Reddit mentioned a macro fix and it has helped many but it has not helped me
313	neg	This is a hardware issue
313	neg	I thought maybe it was firmware but no
313	neg	I have updated and still not working properly
313	neg	I'm very upset with this and I will be contacting their customer support for a replacement
313	neg	What an inconvenience
313	neg	2 stars for being a beautiful paperweight in one year
314	pos	The weights are a cool concept (although I ended up only using one, usually I like light mice)
314	pos	The main con: The unlockable scroll wheel sort of moves a bit/creates a rattle if you move the mouse quickly, whether locked or unlocked
314	pos	It really is not very noticeable when using, but that is my only issue with the mouse
314	pos	Otherwise, all of the side buttons are placed very nicely to be able to use while gaming without having to really move your hand
314	pos	It glides nicely
314	pos	The build quality is definitely good for the price point but not as good as some of the more expensive logitech mice
315	neg	a bit on the bigger side so its a little harder for me to hit the dpi button but its doable
315	neg	build quality is good and egos are great
315	neg	logitech app works greatEDIT: After just seven months the left click button is now constantly double clicking
315	neg	It's impossible to play games or even drag a window from one monitor to another
315	neg	I tried to contact customer support and they want a video of the mouse clicking and several other steps before they will even consider taking it back
315	neg	I probably sound a little entitled but I'm not the only person who has had this issue with this mouse that's less than a year old, the onus should be on logitech to prove that their product that is know to have this fault is working, not on me to prove its broke
316	neg	I want to start by saying I love love love this mouse
316	neg	Feels nice in my hand, love the weight adjustability option
316	neg	Overall I've just gotten really familiar and attached to it for no reason
316	neg	For just every day use and playing my favorite games, this worked wonderful
316	neg	for a while
316	neg	Unfortunately, I have now experienced the constant click/double click issue
316	neg	I bought this mouse back in September 2020, it's now June 2020
316	neg	I first noticed the click issues, minor at first, around April
316	neg	When I clicked and held, expecting to shoot in R6S, it would shoot one bullet, then pause, and maaaaybe continue intermittently
316	neg	Usually I'd have to click again and by then it was too late, I was dead
316	neg	At first I thought it might be how I was gripping and clicking on the mouse button
316	neg	As time got on it has gotten worse and expanded to the right mouse key as well - I can no longer aim down my sight consistently, it either doesn't register, or puts me in only to take me immediately out, no matter how I click or grip the mouse
316	neg	During the time I've had the mouse, I've been using it daily for several hours - so I'd consider it heavy usage
316	neg	It served me well for a large majority of my time
316	neg	To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or takes its sweet time and clicks however many times it wants while dragging
316	neg	This creates a lot of issues with my gaming so I will be purchasing a different mouse to replace this one :(
317	pos	I want to start by saying this was bought as a replacement for my other (2018) G502 that I myself broke while cursing the developers of a certain franchise
317	pos	First and foremost, this mouse is incredibly well constructed
317	pos	I mean, to take a beating like it did and STILL function was something a Corsair/Razer mouse could never dream of achieving (I would know)
317	pos	Second, lets bring some attention to the mouse wheel
317	pos	For me, it's always the first thing to go on a mouse, this one was the exception
317	pos	Even after the beat down it STILL functioned flawlessly and I cannot believe it
317	pos	Also, a free spinning mouse wheel with a mechanical toggle switch was for sure something I didn't realize I needed in my life at the time
317	pos	Third, this mouse is incredibly budget friendly, especially when it's on sale
317	pos	To be honest, I don't actually know how Razer and Corsair compete with this thing on the market
317	pos	Fourth, the adjustable weight may not seem like a big deal but if you're newer to PC gaming it'll offer you some versatility that others overlook
317	pos	If you've been looking for a sign to switch gaming mice, this is it
317	pos	You will not be disappointed
318	neg	The mouse overall was decent while it lasted
318	neg	However the software for the mouse is pretty poop
318	neg	There were numerous bugs with the software, manually starting the Logitech app every time I boot up was pretty annoying after awhile
318	neg	The software also struggled to read games that weren’t associated to steam, and I would have to manually map my buttons every time I hopped on them, like valorant (has since been fixed) and a few other non steam games
318	neg	I purchased this mouse in March and the left click broke in July
318	neg	a gaming mouse that has lasted me around five months, for a few hours a day
318	neg	There is no external damage to the mouse, nor has it ever been dropped
318	neg	The same day the left click broke the rgb decided to go out
318	neg	When I plugged it into a different port the port then shorted and broke the usb3 ports on the front of my computer
318	neg	There’s a reason it’s on sale all the time
318	neg	This mouse is probably worth the $40 if you’ve got money for a second one in a few months
318	neg	-Update: Amazon will be sending a replacement, after numerous attempts to get into contact with Logitech
318	neg	Does Logitech support just have a phone that rings all day in a noise proof room
318	neg	I’ve sat on hold with them for 30+ min three different days on a single week, no answer
318	neg	I’ve even left a message with a problem and callback number, that was two weeks ago, no answer
319	pos	The first Hero I bought had "unintended scrolling"
319	pos	What I mean is the scroll wheel was so off-balance the wheel would always rotate itself so the same spot was down
319	pos	I learned to never take my finger off the wheel, but this got old, so I returned it for the older model Proteus
319	pos	That one came, but the USB cord was so deformed coming out the front of it the mouse would stand-up on the mouse pad
319	pos	I tried to just straighten the cord, but it kept deforming and causing high friction against the mouse pad
319	pos	So I returned that one again, and the 3rd mouse was another Hero that is acceptable
319	pos	This scroll wheel stays in place as long as I don't bump the mouse
319	pos	So yay, I finally have a nice mouse
320	neg	This is the first and only mouse I've experienced this with and I've owned a lot of mice (primarily logitech)
320	neg	It fits comfortably in my hand and ergonomic but it's frustrating when you need to right click and drags something
320	neg	Opened a ticket with logitech support and was on the phone for 1 hour with support following their standard procedures
320	neg	Finally I was able to initiate a return and they wanted some standard information about the product but then they wanted a video showing my hand on the mouse while trying to right click and drag something to prove that the item is defective
320	neg	They also wanted me to send a picture of the serial number along with a written support ticket number on a piece of paper
320	neg	I have to say this was the oddest RMA I've ever done for a $50 product
320	neg	Support also claims that the replacement is not in stock and usually takes 2-3 weeks to get
321	neg	The mouse came fast and packaged perfectly but I only got about 5 minutes of use out of it before the mouse wheel broke
321	neg	This mouse uses some kind of pinwheel sensor for the scroll wheel that instantly becomes blocked and causes the the scroll wheel to ruin anything you're attempting to read with an uncontrollable up and down scrolling spasm that goes on for several seconds after you stop touching the scroll wheel
321	neg	I saw people mention it but didn't think it would be that big of a deal but this is terrible
321	neg	It causes an instant migraine
321	neg	Shame on Logitech for using this faulty design
322	neg	Could just be me but I didn't like this mouse
322	neg	After my son loaded some crazy setup in the memory it started acting up
322	neg	When I finally figured out how to use the software to clear the internal memory it would work normally again but then any other pc I plugged it into started having the same crazy problem(constant backspace)
322	neg	that would require another mouse to be able to download the software and set it to clear the internal memory to get it to work right again
322	neg	The mouse wheel was either to tight or if I used the free wheel it was to loose
322	neg	After fiddling with it I finally just threw it in the trash and replaced it with a $20 mouse
323	neg	Bought this mosue as a upgrade to the original G502 as this one goes up to 16K dpi while the older model maxed at 12K DPI
323	neg	Not more than 4 months after I got it I started noticing the right click would "double click" when clicked once or it wouldn't hold a click either
323	neg	Now 9 months later and the left click is going out too, whenever I click on the top of a window it double clicks for me maximizing the window
323	neg	This was never an issue with the original 502s, which i've had one last for a couple years before showing any signs of stopping
324	pos	My hand is 6 inches from palm edge to middle finger tip
324	pos	The mouse fits my hand well but not quite as high as I like to be really comfortable for a claw style grip
324	pos	That doesn't detract from the the options I use most
324	pos	I love the dpi-on-the-fly buttons right up by my left finger and the free spinning mouse wheel at the touch of a button
324	pos	I didn't think the provided weights would be enough but they actually work well
324	pos	I work 10+ hours a day with a lot of mouse use and this is a great mouse
325	neg	Purchased in July 2020, it is now April 2021, so give or take 9 months of use
325	neg	For about a month and a half now, the left mouse button doesn't click properly, sometimes it doesn't single click, often it doesn't hold a click (i
325	neg	e
325	neg	when making multiple selections, or holding down your fire button in a game)
325	neg	Amazon says the return and support window are closed
325	neg	Filing a warranty claim with Logitech is a last resort
325	neg	Kind of sad when your product has a shorter lifespan than the average magpie
326	neg	I had this mouse for about a year and some change, and I loved it
326	neg	Absolutely loved
326	neg	Unfortunately, the left mouse button started double clicking when I was single clicking or attempting to click and drag
326	neg	This made work and gaming impossible (double clicking an item in the game I play is a different action than single clicking), so I figured I'd replace it
326	neg	I bought the same brand as a replacement because I loved the mouse so much, and it had such a great review score so I figured it was a one-off fluke
326	neg	Within 2 months the new mouse had the same issue
326	neg	It was only then that I read the one star reviews and noticed how frequent this issue is
326	neg	I am only writing this review in an attempt to help the amazon review reach a more realistic score for such a flawed product
326	neg	If it had happened once I would have thought it me being unlucky
326	neg	But two of the same mouse had the same issue in such a short amount of time
326	neg	Now, I am looking at new mice again, and will be forced to switch brands
327	neg	Logitech has used (and continues to use) cheap switches in this mouse, which results in the mouse working fine for a few months, then your left and right buttons will begin to fail
327	neg	If you're holding down the left click, trying to move something around your desktop or charge up a shot in-game, the switch will register a quick release and re-click
327	neg	This issue is called double-clicking and is well documented with this mouse
327	neg	Logitech's customer support is also pretty terrible, so you won't get any help from them for several weeks, if ever, and the replacement devices will have the same bad switches
327	neg	Skip this mouse
327	neg	It's not worth the headache
328	neg	Everything worked fine for this mouse except after few months of use, the right click hold started to fail to stay on hold
328	neg	Not being able to hold right click consistently is a HUGE problem in FPS games as I don't use toggle ADS and other features like secondary fire needing consistent right click holds
328	neg	I kept firmware updated via their program and attempted to troubleshoot but problem still persisted
328	neg	If you google this product's name with right click, you'll see that many other people have the exact same problems as I have
328	neg	I'm surprised how this product is still highly rated
328	neg	Anyways I'm leaving this product 1 star due to unable to refund
329	neg	The mouse is otherwise functional, nice shape and feel
329	neg	However, when I downloaded the driver for High Sierra, the icon has an X through it indicating incompatibility with the OS
329	neg	There were some settings I wanted to adjust that could not be done in the Mac's native mouse dashboard
329	neg	I went to Logitech for customer service and the chat is a robot that sometimes crashed mid conversation
329	neg	And when I finally submitted 2 tickets, I never heard back
329	neg	That was 1 week ago
329	neg	Granted there was Christmas in there but still at least 3 business days passed
330	neg	the ergonomics are not great, it is very flat and long compared to other ergo mice i have
330	neg	It does not lend to easy use of holding and manipulating because of the flat profile
330	neg	It also seems very imprecise on cursor movement
330	neg	compared to a 3 year old MS mouse and a 5 year old Logitech wireless mouse, it does not move to desired spot as cleanly and accurately
330	neg	Which is disappointing, because I would think a wired mouse would actually perform better in this function
330	neg	I personally find the adjustable weight to be kind of pointless
330	neg	The only positive is the easy to program buttons
331	pos	I bought this mouse to replace my worn out Roccat Tyon gaming mouse
331	pos	I had never used a modern logitech mouse, much less the G502
331	pos	I decided to give it a try based on the reviews and the price
331	pos	I love the ability to add or remove the extra weights as needed
331	pos	The Logitech G hub software is easy to find and download, this is the app that allows to easily change advanced settings like LED color/brightness, and most importantly to customize the programmable buttons
332	neg	The mouse itself is fine
332	neg	Customizable and good remapping, but where it fails is the "Gaming mouse" portion
332	neg	The whole concept of a gaming mouse is to make it as ergonomic as possible
332	neg	Several of the key buttons fail to do so spectacularly
332	neg	While the mouse wheel being 2 different buttons for left and right pushing is a nice feature, I feel like there is a lot lost in some of the other buttons with how you need to basically curl your finger into your hand to reach them
332	neg	It makes it rather difficult to use the buttons seamlessly since you basically have to reposition your entire hand to reach them
332	neg	It was a nice try, but style does not beat efficiency
333	neg	I wanted so badly to like this mouse
333	neg	Unfortunately I just couldn't
333	neg	The mouse itself functioned pretty well, but the scrollwheel was a little unpredictable due to its many bells and whistles
333	neg	First off, it was really easy to hit the wheel left or right while scrolling, which could make my browser switch tabs
333	neg	It was also difficult to click the wheel without it registering as a lateral movement
333	neg	Lastly, I couldn't get past the shape
333	neg	The odd curves were really uncomfortable and caused some pretty intense cramps in my hand after little use
333	neg	Overall, this was one of the more poorly designed mice I've used in my day, which is unfortunate as I really respect Logitech
333	neg	Depending on your grip style you may find it more comfortable, but there's no getting past the weird wheel
334	neg	I owned the predecessor of this mouse for a very long time (before a "hero" version existed) and loved it
334	neg	I didn't even look around for other mice before buying this one
334	neg	The mouse itself seems to look pretty much the same, but the software is vastly different and worse and makes configuring the mouse miserable
334	neg	Some of the app's features flat out don't even work, like muting audio input
334	neg	The app's interface is also awful
334	neg	There are only a few settings but almost a dozen different screens with mostly redundant information and options
334	neg	Everything is just disabled if you prefer on-board settings
334	neg	You cannot directly edit an on-board profile, which was a core functionality of the previous app
334	neg	It may be better if you wanted to use the 'game profiles' feature but I think that's a sad excuse to permanently run a spyware program that scans all your installed programs and processes just for your mouse settings (just use the games' settings
334	neg	)
334	neg	The old app and onboard setting had its issues but actually worked, so I find these problems to be pretty glaring
334	neg	Update 2/22: this mouse has intermittent jumping issues and the software has not improved
334	neg	Will be buying a replacement from another manufacturer and if I could return this one still I would
334	neg	Very disappointing
335	pos	Logitech's return to greatness comes in the form of a well priced, well designed mouse
335	pos	The only flaw is the software, which borders on spyware for just how much information it requires to be able to edit your sensitivity
335	pos	Very strange, very awkward to use - Profiles swap whenever you change windows or run a game, for example - I eventually had to not only disable profiles entirely but set all four of my mouses DPI settings to 2400 just to get it to stay stable
335	pos	Some games didn't detect profiles correctly and others would lose their profiles when alt-tabbed, making shooters like Battlefield a nightmare to play
336	pos	I bought this mouse as I wanted more sensitive and accurate mouse operations
336	pos	After a year use, I don't think this mouse can be suitable for simple operations such as drag & drop
336	pos	After I want to drag something and press left button, it keeps losing the "grab" while dragging
336	pos	In addition, a single & long click is considered as double-click for some reason
336	pos	I never had this kind of problem with any other wired mouse
336	pos	Maybe it's because the mouse is for gaming
336	pos	But I wonder how gaming can be done with these issues
337	pos	Solid mouse at first but after 8 months I've noticed the left click to fail
337	pos	I cant click a tab and drag it
337	pos	It takes a few attempts
337	pos	I'll try to pause a video and it double clicks it making it full screen
337	pos	I thought it might be the double click timing being too fast so I manually adjusted it in the Win10 setting
337	pos	Didn't help, the problem persists
337	pos	Kind of a shame that this $50+ mouse doesn't last as long as my last LG mouse that was some cheapo kind that came with a keyboard for less than $15
337	pos	Edit: So I should add now that after contacting support and going through the troubleshooting they sent me a brand new one
337	pos	Took about three weeks from contacting their support to getting a replacement unit
338	pos	I have long fingers and needed a larger mouse to stop the claw grip required for smaller mice
338	pos	DPI setting flexibility is great
338	pos	Tracks very smoothly and I like the weights
338	pos	A heavier mouse feels better for some reason
338	pos	LED lights look cool even though I haven't messed with them yet
338	pos	Number and layout of buttons is adequate and something I'm still getting used to
339	neg	30 minutes waiting for customer support from Logitech and nobody picked up the phone
339	neg	Mouse is randomly double clicking both left and right
339	neg	When playing games it wont hold the clicks when aiming down the sight, the same happens when shooting you hold the left click and it randomly releases by itself
339	neg	Update:  I had to fix it myself I added some pictures in case some of you wanna try to replace  the switches
339	neg	I used those
339	neg	Good luck
340	neg	Initially this is a really great mouse
340	neg	It has very smooth control, finely tunable speeds, easy to access buttons, easy to understand lighting controls and DPI schemes
340	neg	However, while the product performs superior to even my Steel Series, it lacks the quality
340	neg	After a year of use the left click started sporadically working
340	neg	The click and hold fails often now
340	neg	The left click is the primary tool on this device, and as such, it failed too early
340	neg	I looked around on forums and others have experienced the same concern
340	neg	It isn't a driver issue, it is a quality of material issue
341	pos	Initially I received a used mouse, but the replacement one arrived quickly and works great
341	pos	This is a bulky mouse for sure, but it's ergonomic, smooth as glass, and comfy
341	pos	The scroll wheel lock is an awesome feature, and while the locked-wheel is a bit more clunky than I'd like, the unlocked wheel rolls around with ease
341	pos	Such a nice feature
341	pos	I also like the fact that this mouse isn't COVERED in the RGB-gamer-aesthetic too, you don't even have to use Logitech's spyware software, this mouse works right out of the box
342	neg	Update: The tracking comes and goes
342	neg	This is extremely disruptive to my gaming
342	neg	Cannot find any sort of fix
342	neg	Lowering the review to 1 star
342	neg	An hour into using this product, it's tracking has suddenly improved
342	neg	I do not know if it will remain consistent in this, but until it funks up again, I'm changing my review score to a 3 instead of a 1
342	neg	If it doesn't mess up at all, I'll be inclined to raise the review to 5 stars
342	neg	Unlike their predecessor, the hero version apparently doesn't give the option to turn off surface tuning
342	neg	This won't affect everyone
342	neg	but if you have the wrong mousepad, this mouse will not function properly for you, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it, except go buy new mousepads until you get one that works
342	neg	It will lose tracking frequently on the wrong surface, and the only option is to change the surface you use until you find one it deems suitable
342	neg	Edit: 8 months in, the gaming mouse is shot
342	neg	The left and right buttons won't hold consistently anymore, will have to replace the mouse
342	neg	If I had larger hands and pressed closer to the far tips of the buttons, it might not be so much of an issue
342	neg	might
342	neg	As it is, the mouse is useless to me now
343	neg	I bought this to replace an aging Logitech G500s that's been having issues lately
343	neg	The build quality of the G502 is nice
343	neg	Unfortunately I couldn't really use my new mouse because Logitech's G Hub config software just
343	neg	doesn't work on my PC (fully-updated Windows 10 Pro)
343	neg	It opens a completely black window that doesn't do anything
343	neg	Going by Logitech's forums and the LogitechG subreddit, it seems like G Hub is widely known to be really terrible and buggy
343	neg	The G502 is unfortunately not compatible with the older Logitech Gaming Software
343	neg	It's appalling to me that this premium gaming mouse from a long-trusted company like Logitech ships with software that is so poorly made
343	neg	I returned this mouse and got a Razer Basilisk, which works
344	neg	I've owned this mouse for a few days over a year and have gotten a lot of good use out of it
344	neg	Unfortunately, yesterday it started having an issue where it registers a single click or a click and drag as a double click
344	neg	I use this mouse for CAD, graphic design, and gaming so this issue is quite debilitating
344	neg	After doing some research online it seems that this issue is endemic to several Logitech products
344	neg	It would be one thing if this was a cheap mouse or if I'd owned it for a long time, but I shouldn't have to be looking to replace this expensive of a mouse after a little over a year
344	neg	Update: I ended up going through Logitech and utilizing their 2 year warranty
344	neg	I received a free replacement today about 3 weeks after starting the process via email
345	pos	I thought this probably one of the best mouse since its for gaming but I guess not
345	pos	This is a wired USB mouse however it lagging and sometimes not working its freeze like out of battery
345	pos	I then snapped different USB plugs but same problems occurred
345	pos	Therefore the problem is not my computer USB plugs but the mouse itself
345	pos	I bought this mouse to match my Logitech keyboard but I guess I make a mistake or got a defective
346	neg	Thankfully the 2 year warranty covered replacement, but at this point, what does that matter
346	neg	You're paying top dollar for a 'gaming' mouse and the buttons start to short out after less than 3 months of use
346	neg	I'm a gamer that games probably an average of about 2 hours a day
346	neg	I don't play intense FPS, I don't aggressively click or abuse my mice
346	neg	My last mouse lasted me literally 5+ years
346	neg	I've now gone through 2 of these in less than 6 months

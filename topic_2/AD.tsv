1088	pos	I was looking for a gaming mouse with additional buttons that I can hotkey
1088	pos	I really enjoy this mouse, it does everything I want it to do, very ergonomic, won't break the bank, the lighting features are cool, but I'm on my second mouse because the first one only lasted seven months before the clicking wasn't registering properly
1089	pos	I had stopped buying Logitech mice as I had mediocre experiences with their mice in the 2000's, but this one is really quite a quality product
1089	pos	It is definitely more precise and feels better to use than the low cost brands
1090	neg	Spend 2 hours trying to make SetPoint recognize this G502 mouse, then checked online "logitech setpoint does not recognize mouse", and found out it is wide spread problem
1090	neg	anyways, no logi products for me anymore
1090	neg	I like my old G5, but I guess logi does not make solid products anymore
1091	neg	mouse feels awesome in the hand, it was obviously used when it was shipped to me
1091	neg	There were no weights in the plastic bag it came in, and the gliders already had crud in them
1091	neg	The mouse though is fantastic, works well with the rest of my Logitech equipment
1092	pos	Good mouse with programable buttons
1092	pos	However, you do have to use their software to program some of the buttons which is a bit clunky but usable
1093	pos	I play alot of games and require quick accurate equipment this works wonderfully
1093	pos	The mouse üêÅ has been very good at sensing small movements
1094	pos	Got this for my son for gaming, and he uses it all the time
1094	pos	Great product and value
1095	pos	I got this mouse for gaming and it has worked great
1095	pos	the mouse has great ergonomics great sensor and the buttons feel superbthe scroll wheel has two options no resistance or resistance and if you use x mouse button control and set if to left click LOL
1095	pos	the software great if you learn how to use itbuttons 4

1095	pos	5 stars
1096	neg	I was so excited when I ordered this mouse
1096	neg	I saw so many reviews
1096	neg	Everyone talks about how many buttons it has and how good the mouse is but what no one tells you is that 3 out of the total buttons are only for dps
1096	neg	They can't be remapped
1096	neg	They are totally useless
1096	neg	Just sitting there right next to the left click button
1096	neg	Even the software doesn't have an option to remap these 3 useless buttons
1096	neg	Total disappointment
1096	neg	I wish I ordered some other mouse
1096	neg	I packed the mouse back in the box
1096	neg	It's sitting in my cupboard now along with other useless products
1097	pos	I have had it for a few months and it is holding up so far
1097	pos	It is pretty responsive
1097	pos	Hopefully it will last a long time
1098	neg	Like others have said before: whilst the mouse may be comfortable and works for a couple of months, I noticed while playing online matches that holding down the left click would no longer work
1098	neg	Any game that relied on me needing to hold it down only ended in frustration and apparently this is a known issue with an internal component
1098	neg	You can click regularly but anything longer than a second is pointless
1098	neg	If I was only needing to do simple web searches this wouldn't be a problem but considering I bought it for gaming =/
1099	pos	Plugged it in & it just worked
1099	pos	Had to download software from logitech, but that was easy to do
1099	pos	The logitech software makes it super easy to customize the buttons, and the extra weights are perfect
1099	pos	Also the dual mode scroll wheel wasn't something I knew I needed, but now I love it
1100	neg	Ordered a new logitech mouse, received a used one
1100	neg	I saw another review who had the same issue
1100	neg	Seems like TechNoLogic is trying this trick on a regular basis
1100	neg	This review is NOT for the product, but for the TechNoLogic storefront, if anything, Logitech should be concerned that their product is receiving bad reviews due to a shady seller
1101	pos	I don‚Äôt really have much experience with gaming mouses prior to this purchase
1101	pos	All I can say is that I love it
1101	pos	Logitech G-hub allows for nearly full customization of all mouse features
1101	pos	DPI settings can be customized and shifted to by the click of one of the mouse buttons
1101	pos	Colors can be customized as well
1102	neg	First mouse I received was defective right out of the box, had a free-rolling scroll wheel as other buyers have experienced
1102	neg	The second mouse I received worked for a day, then the scroll wheel had the same issue
1102	neg	The exchange service was extremely fast but unfortunately the product just isn't going to work
1102	neg	Gonna have to find another mouse
1103	pos	PROS:-Really good for the price-9 customizable buttons-RGB-Exceptional sensor-Amazing wheel-Very confortable-Really usefull software-Adjustable weights-Easy acces to change profiles and dpi (only 1 click)-Infinite scroll wheelCONS:-Not really a con but I think they should've add rgb around the mouse or more rgb in general
1103	pos	Once you have it it seems to be a little rgb in the mouse
1104	pos	Love the scroll button lock and unlock feature
1104	pos	definitely  helpful
1104	pos	also comes with weights to install into the mouse
1104	pos	in case the mouse is too light feeling
1104	pos	Best mouse I've had in a long time
1105	pos	The mouse is a big upgrade for me and whether i'm destroying small children in Warzone or grown men in Tarkov i can trust that my mouse will allow me to dispatch my foes at the optimal rate
1105	pos	For real though, having the ability to switch dpi mid game or between games without having to open the settings is a massive plus and the software is super easy to use for the price the mouse is an easy cop for someone looking to either upgrade or try something new
1106	pos	I'm a big dude, and my hands fit comfortably around this mouse
1106	pos	I also like some heft to my mice, and with the hot swappable weights you can put in the bottom of the mouse, it makes getting those precise headshots in FPS's when you find the right weight for you
1107	pos	High accuracy and love the customs option for all the buttons
1107	pos	Im a graphic designer and also a PC gamer, have configuration of the buttons for each thing
1108	neg	This mouse is rated to a million clicks
1108	neg	I purchased it in September of 2019
1108	neg	I didn't get anywhere near that many clicks before the left click button started double clicking when being pressed once
1108	neg	This is very frustrating
1108	neg	I would expect better from a mouse at this price
1108	neg	I'm not going to purchase any logitech products in the future, nor would I recommend them to anyone else
1109	neg	I've always liked Logitech products for their durability, and this one was great at first
1109	neg	But after a year of heavy use, the left click has stopped working
1109	neg	Very ashamed, as I had an old Logitech mouse that lasted for 5+ years
1109	neg	Their quality has declined
1109	neg	Do NOT get this mouse if you want something that lasts
1109	neg	Or you can waste money on a new one every year
1110	neg	The left house button won't stay held down
1110	neg	this is honestly sad because this mouse is near perfect the only other problem I've is the weird button layout  I'm always accidentally pressing buttons when I don't intend to
1110	neg	But to its credit I did have this mouse for a year and a half before it broke still disappointing for a 60$ mouse though
1111	pos	The mouse has a great feel, better than the wireless IMO (which I broke) This mouse is also  more durable to abuse
1111	pos	Dont ask me how I know
1112	neg	The double click issue is insane and I've been trying to fix it for a year
1112	neg	Considering buying a cheap mouse to replace this one at this point
1112	neg	not sure what else to do but definitely cant fix it
1112	neg	Tried everything
1113	pos	A few months out and enjoying this mouse being able to adjust the weight is a plus
1113	pos	I like the feel of the mouse it was a great upgrade from my G302
1113	pos	That lasted 6 years hopefully this mouse long as my g302
1114	pos	The fit and feel on the hand is top notch
1114	pos	You can program all buttons to whatever you want
1114	pos	The sniper button is cool on first person shooters in certain games
1114	pos	The tracking sensor is the best I have ever felt with it‚Äôs accuracy
1114	pos	I use it on PS4 and it‚Äôs awesome
1115	pos	Love this mouse for gaming
1115	pos	Wore out my corsair left click from too much gaming I guess, lol
1115	pos	Bought this one to try out different company
1115	pos	I love it so far
1115	pos	Had it for a few months, gaming almost everyday
1115	pos	No issues so far
1115	pos	By the way I play mostly first and third person shooter games
1116	pos	The infinite spinning scroll wheel with a toggle lock  brother, it‚Äôs not the most useful feature all the time, but when it is, it‚Äôs awesome
1116	pos	Easily the best value gaming mouse on the market
1116	pos	The cord is a nice lightweight material
1116	pos	I still don‚Äôt use a wireless mouse cause they‚Äôre for hipsters
1117	neg	Really 100% scam and they know it mouse breaks after a few months starts to double and miss click and feet wear out no matter what after a year they don‚Äôt make replacements they need to be sued like Microsoft for stick drift they know of the clicking issue I have owned 6 mice now last one I‚Äôm buying
1118	pos	I love this mouse it's the only one I use
1118	pos	My dog chewed the cord and I got another one
1118	pos	They are durable and the colors are nice
1119	neg	The material on the side of the mouse seems to have been fused out
1119	neg	It has been lightly used for 6 months
1119	neg	This should be at least lasting 2 years for use
1119	neg	So disappointed
1120	neg	Left click will release at random and will double click at random only after six months of use was not worth the money
1121	pos	Definitely a comfortable mouse
1121	pos	I am a YouTuber and have been using it for a couple days now, and it has been great so far
1121	pos	Will update if there are any issues but other than that, this mouse is smooth and won‚Äôt slide at all on your desk, which my last one did, the weighting stuff comes In a nice packed case so you can change them whenever, and I love the minimal but noticeable RGB, can‚Äôt wait until my Blackwidow keyboard comes so I can match it with this mouse
1121	pos	It really is top of the line
1122	pos	Great mouse, good weight that you can adjust with the included additional weights
1122	pos	I have one weight in it and it feels great
1123	pos	Bought three for work and home use
1123	pos	They fit perfectly in larger hands, are very quick to respond and customize
1123	pos	I also like that they have weight - most other mice are too light and therefore harder to control
1123	pos	Highly recommended
1124	pos	I bought this to replace a Corsair Dark Core wireless
1124	pos	The Corsair software was so buggy and would always crash, loose settings etc
1124	pos	Alway at the worst time in a game as well
1124	pos	This logitech is comfortable,  feels great and the software is easy to use and I haven't had any problems
1125	neg	Loved this mouse until the left clicking completely failed, ~9 months into ownership
1125	neg	You will find that purchasing this through amazon you will not get your warranty honored either
1125	neg	Don't buy this mouse, don't buy it on this website
1126	pos	Accurate and has a nice weight to it
1126	pos	I myself like heavier mice, so the option to add weights to it is a big yes
1127	neg	Be aware that if you buy this mouse, it has a very high chance of developing a known double clicking issue
1127	neg	Logitech is well aware of this issue but will still make you jump through hoops to prove that it's happening and THEN deny your warranty claim
1128	neg	I honestly how the button on this feels
1128	neg	It doesn't give you a clear indication of your clicks which I feels is absolutely necessary in a good mouse
1129	neg	Absolutely fantastic mouse for 7 months
1129	neg	Double click problem started a few weeks ago
1129	neg	From reading reddit threads, people say that there's no real fix and it's because of a design flaw
1129	neg	Here's the explainer on the poor design: search "Failing switch problem: Omron vs the modern mouse circuit" on youtubeNever dropped
1129	neg	Regular use, 2 hours a day gaming and regular internet use
1130	neg	Versatile, looks really cool and lots of buttons
1130	neg	Unfortunately it forced my hand into an awkward position mainly because of the button where the thumb should rest
1130	neg	Too uncomfortable
1131	pos	I always get a logitech product if i have a chance, and i would like to use logitech product in gaming
1131	pos	There are no cons in all the product i've used on logitech product which is really good
1131	pos	Its really good with extra 3 buttons on the left
1132	pos	Great in all the ways advertised
1132	pos	Only caveat is that ergonomically speaking, my fingers tend to naturally rest much lower than intended so I don‚Äôt quite reach the side buttons (especially the one to lower DPI for small movements) unless I shift my hand farther up and it is a little awkward
1132	pos	Might just be a me problem though since I have small hands for a dude
1133	pos	The mouse wheel is one of the biggest issues i had with this mouse
1133	pos	It got extremely flimsy as time went on and when doing flick shots i can feel the mouse wheel smack the sides when moving the mouse in rapid successions
1133	pos	I play FPS games pretty competitively so this was a huge problem for me
1134	neg	This was the best mouse 4 friends and I could've asked for
1134	neg	we were happy as a clam for about 2-3 weeks
1134	neg	but by the time the 3rd week ended 4/5 of them had broken scroll wheel
1134	neg	meaning it wont sense the scroll
1134	neg	we thought the freestyle and click option for the wheel was cool
1134	neg	but now we're thinking its part of the problem
1134	neg	4/5
1134	neg	come on thats ridiculous
1134	neg	you've failed me for the last time logitech
1134	neg	Only recommended if ur gaming specifically
1134	neg	it seems minor
1134	neg	but next time u are reading a web page or looking at a build for a game
1134	neg	notice how much you scroll
1134	neg	not worth it unless u set them up at tournaments or something where they have no use to the wheel
1135	pos	Solid mouse, I was worried about it being 'heavy' but its perfect for me tbh
1135	pos	I love the dpi lock button aka the sniper button, really clutch in games
1135	pos	Feels pretty ergonomic and I haven't had a problem with it so far
1136	pos	Good quality mouse however the price is lower in stores
1136	pos	I prefer razor streamlined, simple and lightweight design but this one is not bad
1137	neg	I've had this mouse for 3 months now
1137	neg	I've always loved Logitech products but this mouse has problems that make it unusable
1137	neg	Left and right buttons seem to have a mind of their own
1137	neg	Accurate drag and drop is near impossible
1137	neg	Even when applying extra pressure the drop happens randomly and unpredictably
1137	neg	Pressing both buttons to move my WOW character forward sometimes works and sometimes not
1138	pos	I can't say anything bad about this mouse
1138	pos	I got it for my 11yo son's birthday, and he loves it
1138	pos	He didn't like the infinite scroll because of changing weapons in games he plays, but I looked it up and there's a simple button for it to be turned off and on
1138	pos	I programmed some of the buttons for him, and am perfectly ecstatic by his love of this mouse
1138	pos	Definitely recommend
1139	pos	I really like the tilt wheel, good for strafing etc
1139	pos	So many more buttons available and looks awesome
1139	pos	I actually ordered it reluctantly based on the picture online but I like it a LOT more in person fwiw
1140	pos	I love this mouse
1140	pos	Super sensitive and the programmable buttons are awesome as well as the extra weights it comes with
1141	pos	My hands are pushing large, so my thumb is litterly on all three side buttons
1141	pos	You get use to it, but I would rather not 'get use to' something I pay for
1141	pos	I would rather it fit like a glove, but I dont know any company that makes tailor made mouses :)
1142	pos	i was a bit worried that the mouse would look over the top with the sharp edges and all the customizable buttons
1142	pos	it actually looks very clean, especially in a low light settings, and the dpi adjustment on the mouse itself is very useful for gaming and web browsing
1142	pos	the rgb screen sampler is also a super cool feature that i wish my keyboard had as well
1142	pos	in conclusion, i am very satisfied with this purchase, and I‚Äôll update this review depending on the state of the mouse
1143	pos	The weights threw this mouse over the line
1143	pos	This is amazing, I've never had a more comfortable mouse to hold and utilize for 8+ hours on end
1143	pos	Sad, yes
1143	pos	True, even yesser
1143	pos	Should you purchase this amazing cost versus benefit superhero
1143	pos	YES SIR
1143	pos	What
1143	pos	YAAAASSSSS
1144	pos	This is a heavier mouse than most but in my case it helped me out
1144	pos	When I had a cheap red dragon mouse my pinky finger would always scrape on my mouse pad but with this mouse I don‚Äôt have this problem
1144	pos	The only problem I really have with this mouse is the scroll wheel rattles a little if you move the mouse too fast but it‚Äôs not too big of an issue to deter you from buying it
1145	pos	Not a bad mouse
1145	pos	Only complaint is the wheel is way too sensitive
1146	neg	Great at first
1146	neg	But then the right side of the mouse just stopped working gaming wise
1146	neg	10/10 at first but 1/10 after a few months and for me I don‚Äôt play hard core games so I don‚Äôt know what happened
1146	neg	I‚Äôve been having a really hard time w/ finding a great mouse and thought I finally found one
1146	neg	But sadly no
1147	pos	IÔ∏è am a controller player and I‚Äôm making the switch in if and IÔ∏è started with the steel series 650 and lemme tell you this mouse if far better
1147	pos	IÔ∏è have medium to large hands and this mouse it legit perfect for my
1147	pos	The buttons all seem to be in the perfect spot
1147	pos	Even if you don‚Äôt need or want the extra buttons this build and hero sensor is just perfect
1147	pos	Only complaint is the price difference for the wireless version and the scroll wheel
1147	pos	10/10 recommend
1148	pos	Worked alright while the warranty was still active
1148	pos	Would sometimes behave strangely and could not control the mouse
1148	pos	Some static electricity arced and it never worked again
1149	neg	Not even 2 months into having the mouse I started to have issues with the right click button
1149	neg	While I was playing rainbow six siege the mouse would un-ADS me or glitch out/stutter
1149	neg	Scroll wheel is cool but not useful specially because if you flick it till change your weapon
1150	pos	Everything I read about this mouse said it was the bee's knees, but it was way too heavy
1150	pos	Apparently I'm some sort of ogre, because it feels light to me
1150	pos	I'm thinking about using the added weights it includes
1150	pos	I agree with everyone else on the other stuff though, great mouse
1151	pos	Good mouse, very useful programmable buttons
1151	pos	The insert able weights are a nice feature
1151	pos	Price is a bit higher than I would normally pay for a mouse, but couldn't find a similar option for cheaper
1152	pos	Best gaming mouse everThis is the third G502 I owned
1152	pos	G502 is stable and fast respondsRecommend to all gamers
1153	neg	I have a cheaper wireless Logitech mouse that never fails to track but when I use this one the cursor does not move sometimes, keeps starting and stopping like the laser is not seeing the mouse pad
1153	neg	I was going to return but forgot to mail it in time so now I'm stuck with a mouse that I never use
1154	neg	It's a great mouse but it suffers from a double click issue
1154	neg	This is my 2nd G502 Hero mouse, both this one and my first suffered from issues within 6 months of purchase
1154	neg	The first had a double click issue and the second couldn't hold a right click, which made highlighting impossible and rendered any FPS game unplayable
1154	neg	I'm  on my third currently, as I thought the first two were just duds
1154	neg	If my current one develops an issue, then it'll be the last logitech product I buy
1155	neg	The mouse was fantastic for me during the first 3 months, with great features and a solid weight
1155	neg	However, I began to encounter drift issues and the mouse randomly not working unless I unplug and replug the USB
1155	neg	No amount of troubleshooting could fix this
1155	neg	It could be possible that i got unlucky, but judging from other reviews there are other issues that plague this mouse and Logitech's QA/QC
1155	neg	If you do get a fully functioning mouse, it's great
1156	pos	Although it doesn't really affect the usage of it at all, it seems one of the lights for the mouse isn't working, more specifically the one near the G5 button
1156	pos	That aside, though, it's a great mouse that's great for gaming
1156	pos	It feels comfortable on my hand and it's very responsive
1156	pos	Would definitely recommend this to anyone getting into PC gaming
1157	pos	Fits nice in your hand, glides ever so smoothly over the surface
1157	pos	Love the interchangeable weights that come with it
1158	neg	This is the second time I have purchased the Logitech G502 HERO
1158	neg	Both my mice have failed on me in less than a year
1158	neg	They both got the double clicking issue that slowly gets worse until your mouse breaks
1158	neg	The first time I made a warranty claim, Logitech never responded
1158	neg	I moved on and purchased another G502 HERO because I had faith in Logitech and their mice
1158	neg	I'm finding that their mice don't last and Logitech will not stand by their product
1158	neg	Steer clear
1158	neg	I have learned my lesson
1159	pos	I'm not sure why this mouse gets so many bad reviews, but its amazing
1159	pos	People are complaining about build quality but I'm sure the issues with the mouse breaking is user error
1159	pos	Overall the build quality is very solid and extremely comfortable in the hand
1159	pos	The RGB lights are very vibrant and also has tons of customizations for the buttons
1159	pos	Overall a very well built mouse for the money
1160	neg	The mouse itself was excellent while it lasted
1160	neg	Felt great, adjustable weights, etc
1160	neg	But I started noticing the right click would let go after about 7 months
1160	neg	I play a lot of FPS and while I'm trying to hold down the right click button, it just acts like I am letting go of it
1160	neg	Now, 8 months in, the mouse doesn't even register most of my clicks, unless I am extremely forceful with it
1160	neg	Very disappointed for a mouse of this caliber
1161	pos	It took some time getting used to because it was bigger than my old mouse (logitech g300s) , but once I got used to it, it's really a good mouse
1161	pos	I got it for less than 50 dollars so it feels like a steal
1161	pos	Would definitely recommend
1161	pos	You can even put weights in it to make it heavier and tinker with the feel
1162	neg	Had the mouse for less than half a year before it started having issues double clicking
1162	neg	Seems to be a consistent problem for Logitech mouse
1163	pos	There is a reason this is the most popular gaming mouse ever
1163	pos	It has a great feel, is fairly light and the software was easy to use
1163	pos	At full price it might have some competitors, but if you catch it on sale it‚Äôs a no-brainer
1164	neg	After 3 months of use, lmb can no longer be held down
1164	neg	It randomly releases no matter how firmly I press
1164	neg	You can search the reviews and see that this problem is really common
1164	neg	I didn't really love the feel of the mouse
1164	neg	It was ok, but not amazing for my big hands
1164	neg	I'm probably in a minority on that one considering how popular it is
1164	neg	My main issue is just the fact that the switch isn't well made and breaks in mere months
1165	pos	Got this for my boyfriend for the holidays and he said he loves it so much more than is older mouse
1165	pos	It also comes with different weights to put in it which I guess is good for gaming
1165	pos	If you‚Äôre looking for a gaming mouse, this is the one
1166	neg	I like the feel and features enough that when the right mouse button became intermittent on my first purchase after about 6 months, I chalked it up to a fluke issue and bought a second one
1166	neg	When the same right mouse button issue showed up on the second mouse I purchased @ 4 months in, I moved on to another brand
1167	pos	I use this mouse for gaming on my Xbox One X
1167	pos	My hands are a little on the larger side, and this mouse is perfect for me because my had just naturally falls into place with this mouse
1167	pos	The response time is amazing and the ability to change your DPI on the fly is very useful for me
1168	pos	So far it is a good mouse
1168	pos	Lot of features
1168	pos	Fit is good
1168	pos	Response is right on
1168	pos	Time will tell if it holds up
1169	neg	Out of the blue, starting today, the mouse will randomly perform a right-click
1169	neg	I have removed the GHub software, removed the mouse from device manager, rebooted, checked for malware, reinstalled the GHub software (latest version)
1169	neg	nothing helps it
1169	neg	I do a little research online and find out that right-clicking already has some issues with this model
1169	neg	We can add this to the list: screw you, I'm just going to right click for you, whether you want me to or not
1170	pos	I bought this for my son and he loves it
1170	pos	it has a large dpi range which is great for your personal customization and the RGB on the mouse is customizable
1170	pos	the 11 programmable buttons are great for gaming
1170	pos	the mouse is built very well
1170	pos	I would suggest buying this mouse whenever it is on sale if you are looking for a gaming mouse
1171	pos	Wanted to upgrade from my M510 for gaming, this mouse is great
1171	pos	The adjustable weight alone makes it worth buying
1171	pos	The adjustable sensitivity, extra programable buttons, and RGB are icing on the cake
1172	pos	Very comfortable, lots of buttons and is accurate
1172	pos	Great buy
1173	neg	I hear the call of the blue falcon as he swoops down upon this mouseKaka
1173	neg	Kaka
1174	neg	I bought this mouse in April and used it for gaming
1174	neg	The left mouse button is already going out
1174	neg	I am extremely upset
1174	neg	My previous mouse was a $30 no-name brand knock off from China and it lasted me three years so this kind of quality for a $65 brand name mouse is incredibly disappointing
1175	pos	My 9 year old is ecstatic over this mouse
1175	pos	It ‚Äòclicks super fast‚Äô and is programmable to make the buttons do different things
1175	pos	He said ‚ÄòI Would recommend
1175	pos	‚Äô
1176	pos	Pretty nice mouse, I have long fingers so this is perfect for me, I would've hoped that most of these buttons weren't DPI buttons but that's my only complaint
1177	neg	Mouse would be great, were it not for the early failure of the left mouse button on both the mouse I originally bought and the replacement I received under warranty
1177	neg	Serious engineering flaw that must be fixed before I can rate this mouse worth purchasing
1177	neg	In its current state, I would not accept money to put this mouse on my desk
1178	pos	only giving it 3 stars because you can get an item with more buttons for a bit more
1178	pos	One complaint I have about this mouse is the buttons
1178	pos	they are in an awkward location for me at least
1178	pos	I have the razer naga trinity and i love it
1178	pos	I guess this will be a good mouse for all ninja fans lol
1179	pos	No complaints but plenty of praise
1179	pos	I have large hands and the mouse is very comfortable
1179	pos	I like how I can sync up my head set and keyboard with the RGB
1179	pos	The weights that come in the box have made it the perfect mouse for me
1180	pos	The best mouse since the main series
1180	pos	Ive bought this is my 4th of that "line"
1180	pos	I dont need anything else
1181	neg	I purchased directly through Amazon and not through a 3rd party seller
1181	neg	Just like another reviewer, I received a used item
1181	neg	I noticed when I opened up the package, the pads on the bottom of the mouse looked scuffed up
1181	neg	Another dead giveaway, the serial number on the mouse does not match up with the serial number on the box
1181	neg	When purchasing, double check your mouse to make sure you're not getting a used product
1182	pos	This mouse is fantastic
1182	pos	It's very comfortable to hold, the buttons are easily accessible, the weights are a nice touch
1182	pos	My only beef is not with the mouse, it's the program Logitech has to change the settings on the mouse
1182	pos	I hate it
1182	pos	Five stars for the quality of the mouse, zero stars for the Logitch G Hub
1183	pos	The wire is a tad bit cheap but that‚Äôs to be expected when you use this mouse for it‚Äôs amazing price deal
1183	pos	And it‚Äôs sensor is so good for gaming I recommend for gamers and if you use a normal office mouse it‚Äôs gonna take a day or so to get used to the new shape and not so much support
1184	pos	Good for work, comfortable and reliable, my right hand never feel hurt or tired again after day long work
1185	pos	Coming from my older Corsair Sabre, I'm now a fanboy of the Logitech HERO series
1185	pos	The weights are great, solid materials, doesn't feel flimsy at all, extremely smooth glide even on an old mouse pad
1185	pos	Definitely consider this one of, if not the, premier mice out there
1186	neg	So, long story short; I needed a new mouse
1186	neg	This one was already a bit wonky when I got it, but I brushed it off as just needing to get used to it
1186	neg	Over the course of two months, I can no longer even left click with this mouse
1186	neg	I've had to dig up the one it was supposed to replace, because even half broken, it performs better than this one at the basic functionality a mouse is supposed to do
1186	neg	Stay far away from this, or any other, Logitech mice
1187	pos	I have 4 of these mice now
1187	pos	Two on my gaming systems and one on each kids systems
1187	pos	They are amazing and have lots of buttons to customize
1188	pos	I'm very smooth reaction time is perfect
1188	pos	It comes with extra weights for the bottom of the mouse 2 guarantee every movement of your hand
1188	pos	My son loves this mouse more than any previous Mouse he has used for his gaming
1188	pos	100% the best one I have bought
1188	pos	And I have bought 11 of them from Amazon
1189	pos	I like gaming mousses, and this is by far my favorite
1189	pos	It has such a sleek design, it's durable, it's ergonomic and it's button clicks are great
1189	pos	But by far, the best feature is the scroll wheel
1189	pos	It has a nice heavy feel, and it has a magic button to make it spin for as long as you'd like
1189	pos	The software is great, has some of it's glitches, and I'd wish that this mouse had more RGB, but it this definitely the best bang for your buck
1190	pos	Its a mouse
1190	pos	It works
1190	pos	Why oh why would they make it so the lights won't turn off when the pc is off
1190	pos	Don't bump the mouse before bed time
1191	pos	The mouse is very solid and the weight of it is great
1191	pos	I‚Äôve been using the G305 mouse for awhile and it‚Äôs a good mouse but I have a tendency to pick it up accidentally while playing a game because of its light weight and I wanted a mouse that weighed more and this is the perfect mouse for it
1191	pos	The G502‚Äôs quality is excellent and it feels great in my hand
1192	pos	Sheeeesh
1192	pos	Let me tell you when I say this mouse is top tier it really is
1192	pos	It feels so good especially with all of the weights on
1192	pos	The grip feels good, the button responses are good, and the customization is a sick bonus like omg
1192	pos	Got this while it was on sale for 40 bucks and I can for sure say this mouse worth so much more
1192	pos	Don't wait cop now üôÇ
1193	neg	Bought this mouse for myself and my girlfriend about a year ago, mine is still running fine but hers broke down after only a couple months of moderate use
1193	neg	Something about the clicks imputing as double clicks and not holding down when trying to click and drag
1193	neg	Read reviews online about shoddy internal parts that they cheaped out on
1194	pos	I love the infinite, weighted scroll wheel
1194	pos	It's also a very beautiful and customizable mouse
1194	pos	The 11 buttons that can be customized using LG's software are well placed
1194	pos	The mouse fits perfectly in the hand, and the hatch for the weights is very easy to access if there are multiple users of the computer
1194	pos	The only slight annoyance is that the scroll wheel can be slightly noisy, but it tracks pages very well
1195	pos	My 11yo loves this gaming mouse
1195	pos	According to him it's the best and coolest gaming mouse
1195	pos	Very satisfied
1196	pos	Was needing a Replacement for my Old mouse and i gotta say Iv been missing out, Having its own software to set you're dpi to your exact needs is great
1196	pos	I dont really care for the RGB but the mouse overall is really nice and has been working great for playing casual and competitive games
1196	pos	It fits perfect for my hand and all the extra mouse buttons are great for rebinding things like a quick melee or things of that sort
1197	pos	This is a great mouse but it‚Äôs a little chunky and hard to get my hand around
1197	pos	Maybe it‚Äôs becaude I‚Äôm new to pc but the expected places to grip the mouse feel bulky
1197	pos	Otherwise, this is a great mouse, super responsive, love the customization, but at the end of the day
1197	pos	is it worth the cost
1197	pos	Probably not
1198	pos	My son had one of these for over 3 years and one button went out so he asked me to get him another one
1198	pos	He just loves using it for his computer games
1199	pos	Amazing for ~40 bucks
1199	pos	No problems with mine, clicks can be a bit springy sometimes but its quiet so i never notice so it doesn't bother me
1200	pos	Worked great for a while until a few years later the left mouse button started miss clicking
1200	pos	Won't be buying another Logitech gaming mouse again
1200	pos	There quality has gone down in recent years
1201	pos	only con is that the thumb buttons are a bit low -- or i have wide thumbs
1201	pos	Sometimes accidentally click M4 when moving the mouse which can be a huge pain while gaming depending on your binds
1202	pos	Given the fact that in my country this mouse sells for almost 100 USD, buying it for 37 felt okay
1202	pos	The mouse is good
1202	pos	The added weights are a great thing and I really want these type of weights to be added to many more mice
1202	pos	One thing I didn't expect was the three-lines zone to only light up when I change the DPI
1202	pos	Otherwise, great mouse
1203	neg	Can't even use the mouse at all now, every time I try doing something the mouse causes my browser to go back a page, and sometimes it will just make it impossible to do anything at times
1203	neg	I know it's defective because I tried another cheap mouse from Walmart in the same USB port and that mouse works fine, and once I unplugged the defective mouse the malfunctioning stopped
1203	neg	Probably just got unlucky, but i'm still rather disappointed that it stopped working within a month
1204	pos	I was looking for a replacement for my Microsoft Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 2
1204	pos	0 which finally died on me
1204	pos	This isn't it
1204	pos	The G502 isn't as comfortable/ergonomic as the Intellimouse, and the scroll wheel is noisy
1204	pos	It clicks constantly while scrolling, which is driving me nuts
1204	pos	Going to return
1205	pos	had a little problem with mine after about a year, but they replaced it with no problems at all
1205	pos	new one still working great
1206	pos	Enough programmable buttons for most fps games, adjust your sensitivity on the fly, ergonomic for ease of use, would recommend getting a cushioned mousepad along with it
1206	pos	The Logitech software is a necessity if you want to program the buttons and adjust the sensitivity levels, rgb, etc
1206	pos	After less than one year of use, the mouse‚Äôs electrical contact is faulty and wont register long clicks anymore
1206	pos	Very frustrating for gaming :(
1207	pos	It‚Äôs a great mouse I recommend it 100% awesome features in the software
1207	pos	However, the scroll wheel has little resistance in the non infinant scroll mode
1208	pos	I like the size texture colors and how you could know what you changed your mouse DPi too
1208	pos	But when I was playing Roblox I have to hold right click most of the time so I can move around my screen but sometimes it just lags really badly and the screen goes all over the place also I wish you could have added a DPI lock because sometimes when I play I press a button to go up or down DPI and it messes up my perspective and I have to change it again
1208	pos	I also wish the DPI rate was always lit up so I can see if it went down or up
1209	pos	What can I say, went with most buttons and customization
1209	pos	Unlimited profiles and keys, highly recommend for productive or gaming activities
1210	neg	I had my dad by me this for Christmas and the right click fell apart within 3 months
1210	neg	Before I realized I had a problem I bought one for my brother for his birthday
1210	neg	It is so bad when you hold right click it disengages multiple times without letting go of the button (makes it impossible to play fps, even had a heck of a time in warcraft spinning the camera) I had the g500 for years and thought this would be the new great mouse I could have for a while
1210	neg	Thought very wrong
1210	neg	Was pretty disappointed I like the Logitech brand but this makes me shy away from it now
1210	neg	The fact that they still sell this is ridiculous
1211	pos	Rock solid mouse that will be used in photo editing and media production
1211	pos	The adjustable resolution of the mouse is great, as are the weights and lighting effects
1212	pos	There's honestly just two many buttons for my liking
1212	pos	I'm going to have to reprogram my games, and one of the buttons isn't recognized by my rig or Steam
1212	pos	Quality materials and great sensitivity tho
1212	pos	It also looks pretty badass, so that's also a plus
1213	pos	Awesome mouse
1213	pos	Only issue the right n left click are the first things to start messing up
1214	neg	Have been a Logitech fan for a while, had a couple MX510's back in the day, and most recently a MX518 lasting 10+ years
1214	neg	The G502 was a huge disappointment, from the get-go, the middle mouse button rattled when moving side to side, in both locked and unlocked position
1214	neg	Read forums that it's a common occurrence
1214	neg	Additionally, the buttons are crammed so close together that it's inevitable to click something else unintentionally (am a person with skinny fingers)
1214	neg	Going to stick to my old MX518 for a while longer
1215	neg	I bought this because my old G502 was getting old, and started to DOUBLE RIGHT CLICK
1215	neg	Since I liked my old G502 I decided to get another one, this time it was the new version
1215	neg	First week of use and the double RIGHT clicking started only while in game
1215	neg	I contacted support but the live chat is terrible, the emails I got from an "expert technician" was just copy / paste stuff that I've already tried before contacting support
1216	pos	My son plays Minecraft games where you need to click very fast to fight off creepers or other players and he loves this mouse
1216	pos	Great feel and seems to be good quality
1217	pos	Has a nice weight, buttons are good, only problem is the scroll wheel
1217	pos	It holds gunk and is incredibly hard to clean
1218	pos	Bought this for the hubby to play his games on his computer
1218	pos	He likes it a lot & works great
1219	pos	Es mi primer gaming mouse y nunca pense que el rendimiento mejorara tanto con el cambio de mouse
1219	pos	Es espectacular muy recomendado
1220	pos	able to map your hot buttons
1220	pos	weighted to what u want
1220	pos	rgb
1220	pos	and i mean RGBbro this scroll wheel is the best ive ever used so far
1221	pos	not bad for a budget mouse
1221	pos	the weights make no noticeable difference, generally over sensitive regardless of mouse sensitivity setting
1221	pos	what i mean by that is you have to exit your game to make a noticeable difference in mouse sensitivity settings, the sensitivity button on the mouse seems to do nothing
1222	pos	It was my first time transitioning over from controller to mouse and keyboard
1222	pos	I play a lot of Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone, it‚Äôs very convenient how you can customize the side buttons to your playing style
1222	pos	The additional weights that you can put in the mouse are also a plus, it gives you that quality feel with the mouse compared to others
1222	pos	Overall, really great mouse
1222	pos	Would recommend getting it and at least try it
1223	neg	I absolutely loved this mouse when I first got it
1223	neg	If you do a lot of fps gaming where you aim down sights then shoot don't get this mouse
1223	neg	It feels great has lots of good features but after about 3 months the macro switches went out
1223	neg	Every click was a double or triple click
1223	neg	I couldn't aim down sights any more
1223	neg	I couldn't even drag windows to other monitors it would just drop them
1224	pos	Had this mouse over a year and still loving it
1224	pos	Scroll a bit noisy, if scrolling alot
1224	pos	But can unlock to go crazy, which turns out i like to use alot
1224	pos	I love these logitech designs for my hands on long mmorpg sessions
1225	pos	I will just logitech has made quality mice for a little while now
1225	pos	Personally for gaming I love this mouse
1225	pos	I am not saying this is the best mouse ever but for the money I personally don't think you can find a better gaming mouse especially for shooters
1226	pos	Best mouse I have ever used
1226	pos	Feels amazing and the rgb is really cool
1226	pos	The mouse actually knows to stop glowing when computer is in sleep mode too
1226	pos	The scroll wheel has 2 modes, both feel like they are going to work properly for a long time
1227	pos	Would recommend this to anyone
1227	pos	I really love mine
1227	pos	Comfortable and moves easily
1227	pos	Plus you can add weights to your liking
1228	pos	I used to use a cheap mouse that was not controlled by any software or anything like that and it was kind of heavy
1228	pos	but i got this one when it was on sell so it was the best buy
1228	pos	you are able to customize all the extra keys that are on the mouse and on top of that the clicks feel really nice and if you are a gaming i would recommend this mouse any day
1229	pos	Got this mouse for an RPG game, LOL, overwatch, etc
1229	pos	Works great
1229	pos	like the add-on weight, it makes the mouse feel "right"
1229	pos	the only thing I had is DPS setting changs couple time by itself, maybe I accidentally click the dps button in the middle of an intensive game fight
1230	pos	I opened this up and the glide pads on the bottom of the mouse were all dented and it looked used
1230	pos	I like the mouse and its buttons, but I hate the wire
1230	pos	I have always used a wireless,  but wanted a gaming mouse
1230	pos	Everyone says don't get a wireless, but with today's technology is that really a big deal anymore
1230	pos	I am giving it  another week
1231	neg	My mouse was working great until the scroll wheel wont pick up scrolling anymore the mouse grip is very uncomfortable if you have bigger hands the scroll wheel on this mouse is just absolutely garbage there's no grip to it and it just slips from your fingers when gaming
1232	pos	Great for gaming can adjust weight and sensitivity easily the wire is long enough for my setup and love the feel of it
1233	pos	Use this primarily for gaming, love the unlocking scroll wheel, as well as the adjustable weight
1233	pos	If you‚Äôre using a Corsair or Razer mouse it may feel a little awkward at first switching over at first, but I definitely recommend it
1233	pos	My only gripe is I feel like the mouse is a little to small, but like I said before it‚Äôs just awkward to start and you get used to it
1234	pos	first off amazon dont tell me what words to use in my review i will avoid those words now
1234	pos	love the mouse works awesome playing cold war and wooping butt
1235	pos	I have been using this mouse for a couple of weeks now and have gotten familiar with the button layout now
1235	pos	I like the extra added weight that comes with the mouse
1235	pos	I have had absolutely no issues so far
1235	pos	Would recommend if you need a few extra buttons for gaming
1236	pos	Rookie gamer here, I read reviews and bought it on sale, pretty happy with e, it‚Äôs more responsive than a regular mouse that‚Äôs for sure, still getting use to it, I wished I bought wireless thou, I thought it was, lol
1237	neg	But after only a year, I've had 2 warranty replacements and the last one just had the exact same failure
1237	neg	After even mild use, the right mouse button starts to not respond, or respond only randomly
1237	neg	I love the design, the free spinning wheel option, the custom weight, but those features mean absolutely nothing if your primary mouse button hardware fails within 4-6 months
1237	neg	For those of you that still want to buy it, Logitech is well aware of the issue, and their agents will ship you a new one when yours fails with no hassle
1237	neg	My last replacement call lasted all of 7 minutes
1238	pos	It‚Äôs been a pretty good mouse
1238	pos	it hasn‚Äôt ran away yet, but doesn‚Äôt like the cheese I‚Äôve been feeding it
1239	pos	Works as well as my Razer Basilisk did
1239	pos	Very little difference other than looks between the two
1239	pos	I did find the material to feel a little flimsy, but overall, it does what Logitech says it does
1240	neg	Just dead after turning on my PC one day
1240	neg	Wouldn't light up, wouldn't move, it wasn't even in my Device Manager
1240	neg	I'm about to contact Logitech and have a warranty so I'm sure it will be taken care of but it is a big pain to have to do this
1240	neg	I know hardware can go out sometimes but a mouse shouldn't have a problem like this
1241	neg	Tracking is buggy and inconsistent at best and flat out unresponsive at worst
1241	neg	DPI and profile shifting, changing surfaces, changing USB ports, and searching for driver updates have no effect
1241	neg	I would say its only good for clicking on Youtube videos but apparently they are notorious for left click issues
1241	neg	Never buying Logitrash again
1242	neg	It's now September 19th and my g502 hero is already experiencing double click issues with the left click button, which makes most games nigh unplayable
1242	neg	I'm upset because every single Logitech mouse I've owned thusfar (g500, g700s) had been amazing
1242	neg	Additionally, since I ordered from Amazon they've been absolutely horrific about getting me a return
1242	neg	I don't think it's too much to ask that my mouse lasts more than 3
1242	neg	5 months when I'm paying $60
1243	pos	I like the macro key customization for any of the buttons on it
1243	pos	It's comfortable I like the whieghts you can add to it I like using all of them good heavy mouse so I can do fine detail things in games and such really a all around good gaming mouse
1244	pos	I had a regular G502 when it was released and loved it
1244	pos	I ended up giving that away and bought the G502 hero and I absolutely love it
1244	pos	Same great feel with same great comfort
1244	pos	The only thing I feel in this mouse is that when moving quickly, you hear a rattle
1244	pos	Hopefully that's not something loose inside but no issues so far
1245	pos	Loved the fact it came with gram plates to enhance the sensitivity mine has 10
1245	pos	5 grams added to it and outstanding performance
1246	pos	Love it been using for years bought a second to have on hand
1247	pos	The only complain i have is that I accidentally fat finger the mouse speed buttons
1247	pos	However, it‚Äôs not the products fault I have such sausage fingers
1247	pos	There is an app you can download, where you can set a mouse speed and it won‚Äôt change if you hit the buttons like I do
1247	pos	Overall it‚Äôs a great mouse and is the definition of customizable
1248	pos	Good mouse overall
1248	pos	Not as comfortable as my old MX510
1248	pos	My only issue is the bright LED lights logitec put on it
1248	pos	If you bump the mouse at night the lights turn on and iluminate the room
1248	pos	Remove the stupid LEDs and this is the perfect mouse
1248	pos	Or maybe logitec should get into the nightlight game
1249	neg	Love this mouse, bought as a backup to the same model
1249	neg	Hate the shipping negligence of putting a shipping sticker on the product packaging and mailing it as-is
1249	neg	Mine came in badly dinged
1249	neg	not happy
1249	neg	Protect your product
1250	neg	A mouse wheel should be made of soft rubber, so that the finger can rotate it easily
1250	neg	This wheel is made of hard plastic that is too slick and I am continually wetting my finger trying to get traction
1250	neg	There is a toggle button below the wheel that makes the wheel too easy to spin - and it bounces continually
1250	neg	Otherwise the mouse seems fine
1250	neg	But - the wheel thing is too annoying
1250	neg	Returning
1251	neg	The mouse was good while it lasted, few months in there was sticking during usage
1251	neg	There were no unknown substances on my mousepad and the bottom of the mouse was clean but it would still give sluggish and last responses while tracking
1251	neg	Mouse was comfortable albeit not a great match for those with smaller hands, had a hard time reaching buttons with my thumb
1251	neg	Ended up replacing with a razor basilisk v2
1252	pos	I loved this product
1252	pos	I initially bought this for gaming, but now it‚Äôs just my regular mouse
1252	pos	Somehow it makes even doing my schoolwork easier‚Äî
1252	pos	I love the programmable 11 buttons
1252	pos	It‚Äôs very useful
1252	pos	I love the adjustable weights, but personally so keep all weights in my mouse for the heaviest/most weighted
1252	pos	I will100% be buying this for my friends as gifts or something
1252	pos	I just wanna share this with them, because this mouse is the best
1253	pos	the ONLY reason I would not give it a full 5 stars, is that the mouse wheel buttons, where you slide the mouse wheel left or right, have a habit of activating when you only wanted to use the center click
1253	pos	I didn't need them, so my solution was to leave them unbound, but then again, it could have been the way I was pushing the center mouse wheel
1253	pos	Over all, would buy again
1254	neg	Bought in March and now does not work, reinstalling drivers didn't work
1254	neg	Mouse randomly doubleclicks or fails to hold a click
1254	neg	This is seriously the last logitech mouse I'll own given the AWFUL QC they have going on
1255	neg	The mouse is fantastic for the first handful of months, but after that the cheap switches they use causes clicking problems and ruin the whole experience
1255	neg	Left-clicking and dragging becomes nearly impossible and constant double clicking occur
1255	neg	I've used 3 different G502 mouses and each one has had this problem occur, while the hundreds of other complaints I've read online repeating the same problem
1255	neg	I personally would not suggest this mouse if you desire to have a good mouse that will work for more then 5 months
1256	pos	My old Logitech gaming mouse finally died after probably 10 years of heavy use, so I decided to get this one
1256	pos	It works very well and fits right in my hand
1256	pos	It also has very useful features in its software
1256	pos	I highly recommend it
1257	pos	I do not like the middle mouse scroll wheel
1257	pos	There is zero resistance so gaming is odd
1257	pos	You scroll up or down and since there is no resistance it will scroll a little the opposite direction when you take your finger off it
1258	pos	I love this
1258	pos	Easy on the hands I went from a sense to this and I wouldn't go back at all
1258	pos	Custom button mapping is also a plus
1259	pos	This mouse is alright
1259	pos	After couple of months, I can hear something moving inside when I shake it
1259	pos	Mouse pointer jumps randomly sometimes
1259	pos	But this might be because I am using it on a dark surface
1260	pos	The software to configure the mouse (G-HUB) is a pain and silly
1260	pos	Luckily you do not need the software to use the mouse, but it is needed for the initial configuration and tweaking
1260	pos	After you have found your desired settings you can save the settings to the mouse's on-board memory and uninstall the software
1261	pos	It's a great mouse, a little small for me and unfortunately the right click started going out
1261	pos	I can't return it to Amazon because it's past the time I can return it so I have to work through the manufacturer
1261	pos	Can't give it 5 stars after it only lasting a month
1262	pos	This mouse is great I love it
1262	pos	At first I was a little confused on how to program the buttons but after I looked it up online and downloaded the logitech program for this mouse it all went smoothly
1262	pos	The program is extremely easy to use and you can program any button to do almost anything
1262	pos	The scroll wheel is nice and I love how there is a button each way you push the scroll wheel (left or right)
1262	pos	10/10 rating I would recommend
1262	pos	Best customizable mouse you can find
1263	pos	Pretty solid mouse
1263	pos	Only complaint is that the mouse wheel isn't as tacky as I'd like
1264	pos	It is easier to use wirelessly when not playing games
1265	pos	Many of the "extra" buttons are a bit further up the mouse, so if you don't tend to palm grip your mouse and or have decently long fingers beware of that
1265	pos	You wont get much out of this mouse if that is the case
1265	pos	The mouse wheel is kind of a big deal to me
1265	pos	That thing is quite loud in standard mode and requires more force to press in than it should making it difficult to use in gaming, and this is meant to be a gaming mouse
1265	pos	Free wheel mode is something I've never seen before, it hardly makes a sound in that mode but I prefer not to use it very often
1266	neg	If you look online Logitech's mice have consistent problems with their Omron switches
1266	neg	There are too many cases of them wearing down and malfunctioning after a few months of use
1266	neg	The warranty process of getting a new mouse was extremely annoying and I ultimately gave up
1266	neg	Look into a mouse with optical switches or a company that doesn't run into constant problems with "double-clicking"
1267	pos	yay, i like the mouse, and now I have to write a long review that actually isn't helpful and is just to allow me to press submit
1268	neg	It only last 4 months before start failing the right button, it got double click then, at 8 month it start double clicking on the left button, now 14 months after buy, it just lost the lefth click
1268	neg	it is a cool mouse and very ergonomic, but for the price, i could spect more
1269	pos	My absolute favorite mouse, and the software actually worked for this one (unlike the last
1269	pos	)
1270	pos	Nice corded mouse for gaming and everyday use
1271	pos	Ergonomic but the scroll is really bad
1271	pos	the mouse is comfortable but the mouse wheel is very bad, it cannot be adjusted and it is very annoying when playing shooters and I have to change weapons or objects
1272	neg	Three months after purchase the mouse began double left clicking on occasion
1272	neg	Four months after purchase and the left click has stopped working completely
1272	neg	This is a cheaply made product that has probably put me off Logitech products for good
1273	pos	Does great, I had the original g502 and it worked great so I thought I'd get this one with the new sensor
1273	pos	The sensor on this does amazing at picking up fast movements and making sure it gets transmitted into the game
1273	pos	I am very happy with this purchase
1274	neg	Bought a G502 Hero for me and my wife, both developed double clicking issues on the left and right mouse buttons after only a month
1274	neg	Customer support has been terrible, and has given me the runaround for over a month when all I want is to RMA my mouse
1274	neg	I have purchased Logitech my whole life, but this will be the last mouse I purchase from them
1274	neg	Blatant time wasting so they do not have to replace my mouse
1275	pos	I loved it so much that I've been gifting this to all my friends
1275	pos	I like the way my hand sits on the mouse
1276	neg	Actual trash, low quality product
1276	neg	DO NOT BUY, I have bought so many logitech devices in the past
1276	neg	This has to be the worst, stopped working after 6 months
1276	neg	I have the old original G502
1276	neg	I have had it for 5 years and counting, but this HERO mouse is garbage
1276	neg	( bought 2, both broke within months)
1277	pos	It‚Äôs awesome
1277	pos	everything you need
1278	pos	At first I really liked this mouse, and thought very highly of it
1278	pos	After about a week of use though I started to notice how extremely sensitive and loose the scroll wheel was, which for me wasn‚Äôt good for the way I rest my finger on the scroll wheel
1278	pos	So in games like Rainbow Six Siege I would accidentally switch my gun in the middle of shooting someone, which got really annoying, so I decided to return it
1279	pos	The mouse is perfect
1279	pos	I‚Äôve been using it for a little while now and it hasn‚Äôt been a disappointment, as it functions perfectly and it feels exceptional to hold
1279	pos	I have a G203 as well and I have to remind myself that I still own it because I‚Äôm always using the G502
1279	pos	Overall an incredible mouse, great build quality, performance, and looks
1280	pos	I enjoy being able to change the weight of the mouse depending on what I'm doing
1280	pos	With the software from Logitech it makes doing anything a breeze
1280	pos	I've created profiles for when I'm coding so that I can more easily copy, paste, and anything else I need to do within the programming language
1281	pos	Excellent value for the money
1281	pos	Has a lot of great features & is easy to setup using the Logitech software suite
1282	pos	I am a gamer and i love the products made by logitech, and this one surprised me the most
1282	pos	the build quality is amazing, fully customisable mouse buttons, the option to make mouse setting ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù, and even changing the weight of the mouse and comfortable feel on your hands is amazing
1282	pos	100% would recommend, amazing bang for your buck
1283	neg	I bought 2 of these mice and I use them for competitive fortnite after I had them for a bout 4 months it started doing wired stuff like turning off for no reason then my scroll wheel started locking up and would get stuck and then one of them just wouldn‚Äôt work out of nowhere now just today my one that is left I‚Äôve had it for a bout 6 months now it‚Äôs now double clicking and this mouse is also really heavy my wrist herts all the time cause of how heavy it is
1284	pos	With the logitech programn it makes it easy to set this mouse up and the price is perfect this is my second  1st one lasted years
1285	pos	I was so disappointed when Logitech stopped making the G9X years back
1285	pos	If you loved the G9X, you will really love this mouse
1286	neg	Got this mouse in February 2019, now it is early August and it is almost unusable due to double clicking issue
1286	neg	this was a replacement for my razer mouse that did the same thing
1287	pos	This mouse is Great
1287	pos	I‚Äôve played Fortnite, Cold War , modern warfare, Roblox & Rage 2‚Ä¶ This mouse preformed well
1287	pos	The only dislike i have with this particular gaming mouse is that the scroll wheel is really lose
1287	pos	Scrolling once will actually scroll multiple times & that can get kinda annoying
1287	pos	Overall great for the buck
1288	pos	I love my mouse; since I was used to get mouses for about $10 - $15, this is the most expensive I've ever bought
1288	pos	Pros: everything: feels premium, works perfect, fits perfect (I have big hands), I use it's whole weight and I love it, I hate light mice, so it's a good choice
1288	pos	I don't regret it
1289	neg	Had the mouse just over a year and both left and right mouse buttons started spam clicking it started with the right mouse switch and then the left switch started actin up
1289	neg	Replaced them but i am not buying logitech ever again
1289	neg	its a no brainer that you shouldnt buy something new that will require replacement parts in less than a year
1290	pos	I'm never buying any other mouse
1290	pos	The extra buttons are very useful, it has the perfect size for my hand, lot's of costumization, very precise but it is heavy
1291	pos	The G502 Hero is a nice and responsive mouse with nice features and customizing
1291	pos	I had a G502 Proteus Spectrum before buying it
1291	pos	The only problem I have with it is when you move your mouse the middle mouse key jiggles around which causes the mouse to shake accompanied by an annoying rattling sound
1291	pos	It makes no difference whether the wheel is on freespin or not
1291	pos	My Proteus Spectrum doesn't have this problem and it's mouse wheel is functionally the same
1291	pos	I will keep using my Proteus Spectrum
1292	pos	I struggle with a lot of gaming mice because they're simply too big for me
1292	pos	This is the second incarnation of this mouse that I have purchased, the first being the Logitech proteus spectrum
1292	pos	Everything is reachable and comfortable for small hands
1293	pos	Best mouse yet for gaming
1293	pos	Would recommend to anyone
1293	pos	A friend recommended it to me :)
1294	pos	I'm on my third mouse due to the left click failing (multi clicks, failing to recognize clicks, etc), but they seem to last 6-8 months under heavy usage
1294	pos	For the price it's tolerable, but not by much
1295	pos	I'm new to PC gaming
1295	pos	Switched over from console(ps4)
1295	pos	I looked at several different gaming mouses and watched a bunch of videos
1295	pos	And I must say I'm glad I chose this
1295	pos	It's perfect
1295	pos	Feels good in my right hand
1296	pos	Our son asked for this model after doing online research
1296	pos	He's been using it for a few months now, and is very pleased with the product
1297	pos	Love the weight and feel of this mouse
1297	pos	The multiple settings and onboard memory make it easy to switch between tasks and preferences, and operating systems (I use Windows, Linux, and MacOS)
1297	pos	Matches my Logitech G810 keyboard perfectly
1297	pos	Would definitely recommend and buy again
1298	pos	Works as intended
1298	pos	hero sensor has grade A tracking, ergonomic shape is great for fingertip grip
1298	pos	I used the G402 before I upgraded to the G502 and I loved the shape and feel of it and the G502 is pretty much the same shape
1298	pos	I love Logitech peripherals
1298	pos	I own the G402, G502, GPro keyboard, G933 headset, G910 Orion Spark, and the G13 gaming pad
1298	pos	EDIT: I bought another G502 and it was used
1298	pos	The pads in the mouse were worn and peeling off
1298	pos	like wtf
1298	pos	I‚Äôm not blaming Logitech for this one, this is all on Amazon
1298	pos	selling used products at full price
1298	pos	shame on you
1299	pos	It's a great mouse
1299	pos	Smooth, accurate, lots of programmable buttons (which as a lite gamer I will probably never use, but my bird very much appreciates their clicky noises)
1299	pos	Also, as someone with a smaller hand, it fits very comfortably
1300	pos	This mouse is hands down the best mouse I have ever had in my life
1300	pos	The rgb is the smoothest and satisfying thing I‚Äôve seen in a gaming product
1300	pos	The buttons feel like they have been worked hard on and the feel of the product in total is outstanding
1300	pos	Also the software to change the sensitivity and the buttons is simple and convenient to use
1300	pos	I definitely would recommend this product
1300	pos	And for the price is unbelievable too see
1300	pos	Best value for a gaming mouse
1301	pos	can't say there is anything  wrong with this mouse, it is absolutely amazing specially if you are a gamer since you can make separate settings for different games
1301	pos	If youre looking at this review before buying all I gotta say is just buy it
1302	neg	I liked the idea of having extra buttons next to my left click
1302	neg	That‚Äôs why I bought this mouse originally
1302	neg	I have the Logitech g403 and it feels 100% better then this mouse while gaming
1302	neg	This mouse is extremely heavy (without weights)
1302	neg	I would highly recommend the g403 over this mouse
1302	neg	üöÆ
1303	pos	Very nice distinct inputs
1303	pos	Extra buttons are in the perfect locations for my hand
1303	pos	Easy to use Logitech ghub software
1304	pos	Generally a good mouse
1304	pos	but had trouble where you have to click the DPS button in order for a right click to register
1304	pos	super annoying
1304	pos	but other than that it is a really good mouse
1305	pos	Overall the G502 is great mouse for gaming and work, it‚Äôs fast, light and ergonomic but one of my led stop working
1306	neg	The media could not be loaded
1306	neg	The wheel is so sensitive it will move when moving the mouse too quick or if you pick it up and put it back down
1306	neg	It's so terrible
1307	pos	Heavier than the g pro and ergo shape causes a different grip
1307	pos	Hard to get used to after oval shaped mice for years but def a good product
1308	pos	i love the feeling, the adjustable weights, the customizable lights, but the scroll wheel (even off of frictionless scrolling) scrolls a little longer, i play fortnite a little with this and i use scroll wheel reset, when i do and i go to edit again its still reseting even off of the frictionless scroll wheel setting, overall highly recommend, very satisfied with this
1309	pos	Great mouse, but it drives me crazy sometimes
1309	pos	Every once in awhile it will double click when you single click
1309	pos	It's frustrating, but I understand it's a specific button and that several types of mice use it
1309	pos	Oh, well
1310	pos	Great mouse, I bought it on sale for 40$, I got lucky, very good mouse, I'm not big fan of software mouse however it doesn't take a lot ram or cou usage
1311	pos	This mouse has weights
1311	pos	It's absolutely awesome
1311	pos	If you have big hands this mouse is for you
1311	pos	Definitely an awesome gaming mouse with all sorts of buttons
1312	pos	I will recommend this is the best for FPS gaming
1313	pos	Functionality is great
1313	pos	Not very comfortable after a half hour of gaming
1313	pos	Works well for work, editing, etc
1314	neg	2nd Logitech G502 Hero  same problem as before
1314	neg	After only a month it double clicks 60% of the time
1314	neg	Dont waste time with this mouse
1315	pos	Its an amazing mouse don't get me wrong, and it deserves 5 stars from me, however, the reviews that say you accidentally hit the dpi buttons on the side of the left click, are 100% true
1315	pos	I have gotten better at not doing it, but it still happens occasionally
1316	pos	This is a great mouse for anyone who doesn‚Äôt need wireless connectivity
1316	pos	This is probably Logitech‚Äôs best gaming wired mouse
1316	pos	One small detail is that on my mouse, one of the LEDs don‚Äôt work
1316	pos	Since your hand is covering it most of the time, it‚Äôs not a big deal, but I would give 4
1316	pos	5 stars due to 1 LED not working
1316	pos	I also don‚Äôt want to return it since this is my only good mouse right now (besides an IBM 1990 ball mouse)
1317	neg	The media could not be loaded
1317	neg	Do not buy this mouse, this is the third one I have gotten, I replaced 2 for the exact same issue
1317	neg	The mouse wheel becomes dislodged very easy and begins to free spin
1317	neg	The same exact issue happened on all three mouses I‚Äôve gotten
1317	neg	Also do not get the asurion protection you do not need it they will just redirect you to Logitech customer service
1318	pos	Great mouse, I look forward to as many years with it as I did with my last Logitech mouse
1319	pos	Fast, swift, fits great, much better than a regular one
1320	pos	After looking at several different types and reviewing them, I decided on this gaming mouse
1320	pos	I have not been disappointed
1320	pos	Fits my grip style (fingertip) perfectly, and the buttons are positioned to where I don't have to move the placement of my hand to get to them
1320	pos	Understand your style of grip before buying a gaming mouse
1320	pos	It makes a difference
1321	pos	This is a good mouse, but the wire is wearing out two weeks after my return window closed
1321	pos	Not very pleased with this
1322	pos	Absolutely adore this mouse
1322	pos	It's popular for good reason
1322	pos	10/10 would buy again
1323	pos	Video Player is loading
1323	pos	Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time¬†0:00/Duration¬†0:00Loaded: 0%0:00Stream Type¬†LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time¬†-0:00¬†1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionsCaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window
1324	pos	I mostly use this mouse for gaming since I don't want to accidentally break it when I am using it for checking emails
1324	pos	But when I do use it, it is perfect and it molds perfectly with my hand (which is kind of big)
1324	pos	Overall I am very content with this product
1325	neg	I bought this twice and again I have problem - this time around scroll tilt function (left and right) - such that it just doesn‚Äôt tilt like my G600
1325	neg	So disappointing
1325	neg	It is embarrassing to even return this back to Amazon
1326	neg	This would‚Äôve been a very good product if description was correct
1326	neg	The description said that the hand orientation was ambidextrous  but this most definitely is only for right handed people
1326	neg	I was kinda sad about this because it really is a good gaming mouse just not as described
1327	pos	Lo compre en descuento y llevo unas semanas us√°ndolo y est√° perfecto de los mejores mouses que e usado para juegos y diferentes cosas , lleg√≥ antes de su fecha y todo en perfecto estado , vino con sus pesas y caja original , y me gusta mucho su cable que viene mallado y no se enreda con facilidad , logr√© ver mucha diferencia en los juegos
1328	neg	The dpi buttons are in the wrong place ,very bad design  ,this is not a gaming mouse by far , unless you want your mouse moving at Mach 10 across your screen , quality is good  nice feel , and there is no way to disable the dpi buttons
1329	neg	Mouse was fantastic
1329	neg	Super smooth responsive I play on a aluminum mouse pad no issues no spin out the mouse was great
1329	neg	Now I had it for 8 months and now it double clicks
1329	neg	I did everything from dusting to using a different PC everything and logitech has replied to my email
1329	neg	I bought this mouse when it wasn't only 50 bucks I bought it for their 80 dollar price
1329	neg	Not one word from them and it's been weeks
1330	pos	I cant help but like this mouse
1330	pos	A lot
1330	pos	Use all the weights
1330	pos	Pretty lights
1330	pos	Accurate pointer
1330	pos	Get the wired
1331	neg	I keep making this mistake of buying Logitech mice, thinking it won't be so bad this time
1331	neg	They're decent mice, I like the feel of them and such
1331	neg	But they have almost no durability- my last mouse had a double clicking issue within a year, and now this one is either double clicking the right mouse button or doesn't let me hold the button down
1332	neg	When I got it felt nice till I played some games on it
1332	neg	WARNING
1332	neg	The mouse I got would click buttons on its own when I was in game
1332	neg	The scroll wheel in the middle doesn‚Äôt have any resistance and will spin way to fast to handle anything and trying to hit flicks on a game are next to impossible, just about everything on the mouse rattles
1332	neg	Highly recommend you do your research on another mouse cause I waisted my money
1332	neg	Multiple friends have had the same issue, so it‚Äôs not just once it‚Äôs more of a production issue
1333	pos	i dont know why this thing is so cheap
1333	pos	one of the best mice ive ever owned
1333	pos	durable, accurate, no stupid nonsense
1333	pos	just good mousing
1334	neg	The mouse works fine for a little while and then the cursor moves hard to one edge of the screen and then goes unresponsive for a while or jumps and glitches seemingly at random as you move the mouse
1334	neg	I got busy and didn't do the driver / firmware update dance in time to discover that that didn't help, and now it's outside the return window
1335	neg	The right button stopped responding after only a week of use
1336	pos	My son loves it
1336	pos	He claims it the best he's tried
1337	neg	Logitech warranty support not efficient, pretty long and annoying procedure
1338	neg	This is a smooth mouse, with great customization abilities
1338	neg	I don't want to take the time to take apart the mouse in order to adjust the spring that holds the wheel
1338	neg	Only rattles with side to side movements and especially when you are gaming
1338	neg	I don't think it would bother me for everyday use but no way I can game with this mouse
1339	pos	This mouse is the perfect addition to my gaming setup
1339	pos	The light is programmable and easily so, so even a non-techie like myself can change it anytime I wish
1339	pos	It is also extremely comfortable for gaming and everyday use
1339	pos	If you have the money to spend on a higher-end mouse, this is the one to get
1340	pos	my son like it very much
1341	pos	I bought it to replace a G600 that I had for something like 6 years before the left mouse button started having problems where it would doubleclick and drop holds almost instantly
1341	pos	No longer an MMO player, I got the 502 and it lasted 8 months before starting to do the same thing
1341	pos	I like the additional features, but what's the point if the primary one burns out so fast
1342	pos	Love the mouse
1342	pos	Very comfortable and I love the scroll wheel
1342	pos	Would buy again
1342	pos	Some people complain it's too heavy for fps
1342	pos	I don't personally see this as the case, and I do very well playing Call of Duty and Counter-Strike with it
1342	pos	that being said
1342	pos	if you're going for the lightest high end fps mouse on the planet, this is not the mouse you want
1342	pos	I love it, though
1343	neg	I bought it from the seller "Boston Distributors" and have been using it just fine for couple weeks
1343	neg	Unfortunately, it started to have "double click" issue
1343	neg	So when you click once, it double clicks
1343	neg	Sadly, the seller declined the return
1343	neg	Despite some good reviews here, the mouse can break like my case
1343	neg	Avoid this seller and go for possibly other better quality mouse
1344	pos	Got the Logitech G502 Hero 2 wired mouse for some gaming and home office applications
1344	pos	This thing is awesome
1344	pos	The customization is really excellent, but even with default settings it provides a whole new level of ease and comfort
1344	pos	Responsiveness is at the speed of thought
1344	pos	Highly recommended
1345	neg	I bought this seeing a ton of good reviews but when I got it I was extremely disappointed
1345	neg	First off it randomly scrolls which is infuriating and also doesn't scroll when you try to get it to scroll half of the time, second the click buttons are tiny and hard to use for people with large hands
1345	neg	0/10 would not recommend
1346	pos	Great budget mouse
1346	pos	I was on the fence about getting a gaming mouse but after using this one for one month I love it
1346	pos	Don't have to worry about batteries dying like with a wireless mouse
1346	pos	Multiple customization options with the drivers
1347	neg	After only a couple months of using the mouse, the scroll wheel broke and does not allow me to click down with it
1347	neg	Scrolling is good, but I am unhappy with the clicking not working
1348	pos	I had read comments about double clicking and other stuffsÔºåbut I brought it for a while and it is still working fine even I drop it for a couple of times
1348	pos	More importantlyÔºåit doesnt require me to download a app and then causing some problem when gaming
1349	pos	Love this mouse
1350	pos	It‚Äôs so good I don‚Äôt even have to say anything about it
1351	pos	I had heard great things about this mouse for years so I decided to give it a shot
1351	pos	The shape is great, but it was just too heavy for my taste
1351	pos	I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for FPS
1351	pos	I ultimately decided to return the mouse due to the mouse scroll wheel having an extreme amount of play side to side and having an audible rattle while sliding
1351	pos	I had read that this has been an issue with recent production, so I guess I was just the unlucky recipient of a bad unit
1352	pos	This was a gift for my adult grandson and he loved it and says its the best gaming mouse that he's ever used
1353	neg	I've had this mouse for less than a year and the left mouse button will send double clicks on its own
1353	neg	At first I thought it was just me not clicking correctly but it's gotten progressively worse over the past few months that the mouse is almost unusable
1353	neg	Time to contact support for an RMA
1353	neg	It would be a 5 star mouse were it not for the clicking issue
1354	pos	I have a glass L-Shaped desk and my previous mouse couldn't work without a mousepad but since the HERO has an improved optical sensor, it works completely with or without one
1355	pos	He said his gaming experience is 100 times better
1356	pos	After 8 months of owning this mouse the double click has made it usable
1356	pos	This mouse cost too much for a 8 month life span
1356	pos	The left click is now useless with zero accuracy
1356	pos	UPDATE Changed my rating from 1 star to 3, logitech replaced the mouse with a new one
1357	pos	My only issue is the scroll wheel isn't dependable as a button
1357	pos	If you want to hotkey up or down that's works fine but actually pressing the scroll wheel wears it out around a hundred uses
1358	pos	I bought this for gaming, I like it
1359	neg	I never leave reviews on Amazon, but this mouse deserves a horrible one
1359	neg	It started the random double clicking after only using it for 8 months
1359	neg	This seems to be a very widespread issue
1359	neg	Hopefully if I contact Logitech they will give me a replacement because this is an expensive mouse to have to replace after only 8 months
1360	pos	I‚Äôve had this mouse for about a year now and it still works as good as the day I got it
1360	pos	It‚Äôs overall a great mouse
1360	pos	It feels really good in my hand and I like the fact that you can add weights to it to make it heavier
1361	pos	About 6 months in and I'm starting to notice that the left mouse button will double-click which is really inconvenient in games
1361	pos	It also has issues now with dragging a window
1361	pos	The window goes half-way to its destination and then just dropped off the mouse button
1361	pos	Also had a hell of a time getting the extra buttons to actually work with games to the point I am looking at other options now
1362	pos	Has enough features very fast response if you are lefty then look at one of there other mice as its very right handed
1363	neg	Scroll wheel stopped working after a month and 1 day
1364	neg	The mouse's right-click doesn't work any longer after less than one year of ownership
1364	neg	You wanna play a shooter
1364	neg	Nah you cant aim in
1364	neg	You wanna play an RPG
1364	neg	Nah any right-click is gonna double click and spam 115 times
1365	pos	This mouse is incredibly high quality and isn‚Äôt a $300 gimmick
1365	pos	Very affordable and accurate, improved my performance both physically (grip) and mentally (lack of frustration  from horrendous DPI issues)9
1365	pos	8/10
1366	neg	The software to program the buttons doesn‚Äôt work unless you have the game you want to play installed on the computer you are using to configure the mouse
1366	neg	It only lets you save the default program which takes up all but 2 of the extra buttons, so I basically only have the two extra buttons on the side and it‚Äôs no better than my $10 mouse because I can at least program the buttons on that one
1366	neg	Do not buy Logitech until they get rid of or fix ‚ÄòG Hub‚Äô
1367	pos	Replaced my horrible Corsair M65 Pro RGB mouse (it had terrible software that would reset your dpi to default if you moved your mouse around quickly) with this great Logitech mouse
1367	pos	Works great with all game types but is exceptional for FPS
1367	pos	For MMO's you have three side buttons to add modifiers Shift, Ctrl and Alt
1367	pos	The software is simple, clean and functional
1367	pos	If I run into any problems I'll update my review
1368	pos	Use this mouse nearly daily and it feels good in my hand no problems
1369	neg	I had been using this mouse for almost 2 years, but a couple of months ago it started to double click randomly, there is no real easy fix to this problem and it was very annoying
1369	neg	I think almost all Logitech mouses have this problem and it is stupid that they have not made a fix
1369	neg	I recently replaced my mouse with a Razer mouse that I like much more
1369	neg	Pros:- Has lots of buttons- Has RGBCons:- Is insanely heave even without all the weights- starts to dubble clink randomly when it gets old
1370	pos	I use the mouse for playing video games, and it works great
1370	pos	My only issues are that I need to fiddle with some of the settings to get the DPI to work how I want, and its a little too latge for my hands meaning two buttons are difficult to reach
1371	pos	I bought this mouse to replace a Zowie EC1-A
1371	pos	After waiting 8 days for delivery, the left click seems to not want to hold
1371	pos	Very disappointing product after waiting over a week
1371	pos	Shame because it fits really well in my hand
1371	pos	I also don't like that you have to have the software open to keep the DPI settings
1371	pos	**Edit: Idk what I did, but for some odd reason, the left click has not been having this problem for months
1371	pos	I'd say it was changing the polling rate, but idk
1372	pos	works great
1372	pos	plenty of programable controls
1373	pos	I upgraded from logitech g402 to g502 hero, and it is totally worth it, I love logitech mouse's and they are my favorite, the mouse is awesome and have smooth movement and it can add weight to it, it even have 11 programmable buttons, no wonder why this is ninja's mouse that he plays fortnite with, for value of money it much better than other junk mouses I have use before
1373	pos	Really you guys should get it and give it a try of never try logitech mouse's, they are the best üíôüëå
1374	neg	Expect the switches that drive the left and right buttons to fail after a year
1374	neg	Left click is super squishy
1374	neg	Right click has a high resistance 'snap' or 'crunch' when pressing it
1374	neg	This is not the same Logitech quality I've been relying on for decades
1374	neg	If I wanted to replace my mice every year, I would have just bought a Razer
1375	pos	Replacing my old 502, which still functioned just fine the LED just went out
1375	pos	Lasted 15 years worth every penny
1376	pos	Fav
1376	pos	gaming mouse for the  price
1377	pos	My 15-year-old son loves this mouse
1377	pos	He just built a gaming computer and says this is the one to have
1377	pos	Easy to use
1377	pos	Ergonomic
1377	pos	Price was right
1378	pos	Works well for gaming
1378	pos	The weights that it comes with really help
1379	pos	I have large hands, it feels much different from my last mouse (had it a few years)
1379	pos	Hoping it'll grow on  me
1379	pos	The programming could be simplified a bit for us Boomers that don't take to these things intuitively
1380	neg	The mouse itself is nice design and all and even how it feels in my hand when playing a game
1380	neg	But after only just 2 months of using the mouse the left click started to not work it would double click when i didn't mean to or stutter when i held down left click i don't usually write reviews but this has been a repeated issue with the G502 mice and it's really annoying to have to buy new mice over and over again
1380	neg	3 G502s and never again
1381	neg	Mouse started double clicking after 9 months
1381	neg	I thought I used it kinda lightly
1381	neg	Used mostly for surfing/casual gaming
1381	neg	Seems like it should last longer than that for such a highly rated product
1381	neg	Liked it well enough until the double click issue started
1382	pos	If you're looking for a heavy mouse with rapid left click, this is the corded mouse for you
1382	pos	Was worth it before they dropped the price, but now its a steal
1383	pos	Mouse works great
1383	pos	Nice weight to it, very precise
1383	pos	Buttons easy to program
1384	pos	This is an amazing mouse
1384	pos	I have purchased over 10
1384	pos	Some for me and some for my friends
1384	pos	Truly a perfect product that stands out amongst competitors
1385	pos	As described
1385	pos	Fast shipping
1385	pos	Good pricing
1386	pos	I love the ergonomic design and the look of it
1386	pos	There is only one thing bad about this mouse: the scroll wheel
1387	pos	Feels amazing, I love the extra weight and the metal feeling scroll wheel is my favorite part
1388	pos	but you‚Äôre most likely going to accidentally hit the buttons by your thumb during a firefight
1388	pos	Takes some getting used to
1389	pos	I probably will never buy another Razer mouse again
1389	pos	Both of my Naga's broke
1389	pos	One within a year, and one within just months
1389	pos	I really enjoy the RGB so I opted for this
1389	pos	It feels 10x more accurate to me when aiming
1389	pos	The ount of things you can customize is insane
1390	pos	Nice, I can program a couple of key combinations to be button clicks
1391	pos	Great mice
1391	pos	Not to crazy looking like some other brands, also trust worthy company
1391	pos	Will be buying the same mouse if anything happens to this one
1392	pos	The house is great
1392	pos	I'be been using it for online gaming
1392	pos	I definitely recommend getting the logitech software to get the most out of this mouse
1393	pos	i have used Corsair Mouse, Razer Mouse, Other genetic mouses, but all of them had one same issue, Left click always double-clicking after using it for awhile
1393	pos	also i hate the thumb pad style mouse, but this one is different thumb pad does not intrude you in any way used it for about a 6 months now still dont have any double clicking issue, where corsair mouse started double clicking after just mare 2 months
1394	neg	I had the mouse for two weeks before having to return it
1394	neg	Holding the right mouse button would continuously register new clicks, so trying to pan the camera in games would create stutters and general lack of responsiveness
1394	neg	Reading other recent reviews tells me that this is a pretty common issue with this mouse
1395	neg	3rd mouse with the same issue
1395	neg	Two of them arrived with broken scrolling wheel and 3rd broke after two weeks
1395	neg	I'm wondering if they even quality control their products
1396	neg	I thought this was a good mouse and then the thumb button falls off
1396	neg	this is a POS
1397	pos	Great quality, the user interface on their software is extremely easy to use, you can even set up different profiles for different games
1397	pos	The only downside is that this thing is VERY sensitive
1397	pos	If you play any FPS you will want to put all of the weights in the mouse (there‚Äôs a nice little cutout on the bottom) to prevent any unnecessary shaking
1398	pos	Todo bien muy buen producto
1399	pos	I first bought this mouse six or seven years ago
1399	pos	Some friends were talking about having to replace their mice because something broke, so I bought a backup
1399	pos	Still using the first one and will untill something goes wrong but it's been almost a decade which states how well these mice hold up
1400	neg	I ordered a new one and got used one
1400	neg	OR BAD Quality Control
1400	neg	The cover piece that cover the Mouse Eye/Weight area look so bad and scratches
1401	neg	Purchased this mouse exclusively for gaming
1401	neg	Overall a nice mouse
1401	neg	A little over a month using it and the double click/not holding the click issue came up like many people have stated in the review section
1401	neg	Wish I would have read more of the reviews before purchasing and not just buying based of the Logitech name
1401	neg	Its not worth the money for such a basic design flaw (as many have had the same exact issue)
1402	neg	The left click button has an intermittent issue that will cause this mouse to fail
1402	neg	Google G502 Left Mouse Button issue before buying this mouse
1403	pos	Love the sensitivity and programing options
1404	pos	Wanted a very responsive mouse that offered 3 programmable buttons on the side that felt naturally accessible for a few select hotkey abilities
1404	pos	Wish the trigger button was touch closer to the back, but overall this ended up being the best fit I found for my claw grip hand
1405	pos	You have to use it to feel the responsive and accurate movement, and with free wheel, best mouse ever used
1406	neg	Unfortunately the mouse came USED not new as it was discribed on the order, The mouse itself is very good and comfortable but its so disappointing that the packaging was bad and the mouse had dust and scratches on the back and it was so clear that it was used by someone else
1407	neg	i dont know if mine is defective but i bought it for gaming - wow/dota2 and randomly mid game the middle mouse button rotates because i moved the mouse down or up
1407	neg	and it causes the camera to go in and out rapidly which makes gaming impossible - i do not recommend this mouse
1408	pos	It was very heavy at first even without the weights, but with it being very smooth it was easy to get used to
1408	pos	The cord was soft so it could be flexed easily without getting tangled everywhere
1408	pos	You basically need to download a software system to edit 99% of the mouse but it only takes a few minutes
1408	pos	Over all very good for the priceL
1409	neg	Received this product and all but one light on the side doesn't work
1409	neg	Very disappointed, the lighting was a big part of why I chose this mouse over others similar
1410	neg	9 months of normal use
1410	neg	< 1 hour per day
1410	neg	Right mouse button starts releasing itself when held down
1410	neg	Gradually it becomes more serious until it stops being useful
1410	neg	Cleaning with wipes and compressed air cannot fix
1410	neg	Left mouse button works great even though it is used a lot more than right mouse button
1410	neg	Suspect cheap design for right mouse button
1410	neg	Do not recommend
1410	neg	Will not buy again
1411	pos	The mouse feels really smooth, and the sides are grippy
1411	pos	The quick DPI changer is very helpful during gaming and the side buttons are nice
1411	pos	I also love how logitech decided to make it without crazy RGB
1411	pos	The only thing i dont like about this mouse is that in the only 2nd day of using the main RGB broke and wont turn on, but thats not a big deal
1412	pos	Started out with an old Logitech mouse for gaming, shopped around and spent alot of money on some other brands, in the end I came back to this one
1412	pos	It's been a solid and reliable choice for me for years and I'm not planning on leaving soon
1412	pos	Highly recommend this one for the price
1413	pos	Long high quality usb cable, ample extra buttons, feels great with included weights added
1413	pos	Perfect for the price for high apm gaming
1414	pos	Great value for the money
1415	neg	Worked for about a month then broke
1415	neg	ordered a new one to replace it and after about a month that one stopped working well also
1415	neg	My $14 trash mouse has lasted a year and works better than this
1415	neg	Just get a Naga mouse
1416	pos	This is a solid mouse, a great replacement for my Corsair M65
1416	pos	One small thing though, I find it hard to reach the sniper DPI button with my thumb, but this could be just a me issue
1416	pos	Besides that, I love it
1416	pos	Definitely worth the price if you‚Äôre looking for a upgrade
1417	pos	Great product and I bought another for my granddaughter for her new laptop:)
1418	pos	Great gaming mouse
1418	pos	Super smooth and very easy to set up the rgb controls
1419	pos	The media could not be loaded
1419	pos	Really like the mouse, fits my hand perfectly everything works as should
1419	pos	You can add more weight if u want
1419	pos	Great mouse for the price
1420	neg	This is my second Logitech g502 mouse, the previous being the first iteration, and now the Spectrum
1420	neg	The first mouse lasted around 2 years before the scroll wheel stopped working so I opted for getting this one, the newer version
1420	neg	However, two weeks outside the return period, the Proteus Spectrum left click now double clicks anywhere I press the button
1420	neg	According to articles around the Internet, this has been a problem with Logitech mice for years
1421	neg	1 year 1 month got the click-hold issue not the double click issue
1421	neg	Mouse can't click and hold long enough to drag stuff around
1421	neg	Great mouse otherwise
1422	pos	Favorite mouse ever I dont think I will ever own a different mouse
1423	neg	This mouse is infamous for misclicks
1423	neg	They dont do RMAs either
1423	neg	You have to jump through hundreds of hoops if you want to return this garbage
1423	neg	Never again
1423	neg	Just terrible
1423	neg	Do not waste your money
1424	neg	Had this mouse for 7 months
1424	neg	Did the scroll wheel make some noise when unlocked and moving the mouse sideways
1424	neg	Sure
1424	neg	Did it bother me
1424	neg	No
1424	neg	But both the right and left mouse buttons are not working correctly anymore
1424	neg	Holding either one down is unreliable, I can not even drag windows across my screen
1424	neg	I am searching for solutions, but so far nothing
1425	pos	This has to be the best gaming mouse I have purchased
1425	pos	I used to be a fan of Corsair's but after my wheel broke (no warranty) I decided to try out Logitech's
1425	pos	Feels great, has a great weight to it (i like it on the heavier side)
1425	pos	Looks are awesome too
1425	pos	I like the option of adjusting the wheel, this is a new feature for me and I actually find myself using it from time to time (depends on the game)
1425	pos	If you're debating on purchasing this mouse, I highly suggest you do
1426	neg	I have bought two of theses mice because I thought it must be a fluke
1426	neg	after falling off the desk the middle button started randomly clicking when scrolling and scrolling would skip lines or not work
1426	neg	Love the concept wish it was made with quality materials
1427	pos	Great build quality and multiple options available to configure the sensitivity, colors and weight distribution
1427	pos	Note that the mouse scroll has a release button that makes it work like a flywheel for easy srolling
1427	pos	Install the G-Hub control panel to customize the mouse button / colors etc
1428	pos	For gaming, having quick access to DPI setting is a blessing
1428	pos	Has several weights to find your perfect resistance
1428	pos	I also use it in for data entry, the scroll wheel unlocks and you can flick it to quickly scroll documents
1428	pos	This helps extremely when you are entering data and need to refer to the top of the page for information or even quickly returning to the top of a web page
1429	pos	I ordered this mouse since it claimed to be ambidextrous
1429	pos	I ordered it and it came, the mouse is super comfortable on my right hand but terrible on my left
1429	pos	I could order a left-handed mouse but the DPI would be less and not as comfortable
1430	pos	I have two of these going at home and at work - bought this one as a spare - still in the box
1430	pos	The other two have been going flawlessly for 3 years plus
1430	pos	On sale, the best value gaming mouse on the planet, hands down
1430	pos	It's got a snipey button too
1431	pos	After buying this mouse I will never change to anything else, the scroll feature is amazing on this item as well
1432	pos	Excellent mouse
1433	pos	Best wired gaming mouse imho
1433	pos	The rgb is a plus
1433	pos	Although, it's starting to do x2 clicking
1434	pos	I have been using this mouse for like 2-3 months now and it been hurting my wrists playing with it
1434	pos	Anyway I try to grab the mouse feels weird and it gives me a burning like sensation in my hand while trying to use it
1434	pos	But I am forced to use it since my old mouse broke
1434	pos	So if you have small hands don‚Äôt buy this
1435	pos	I love this mouse
1435	pos	I love the fact that I can change the dpi with just one click
1435	pos	It makes switching contexts super nifty
1435	pos	It's quality is great and the tracking is really good
1435	pos	I highly recommend it
1436	pos	By far the best mous I have used
1436	pos	Free wheel excellent feature
1436	pos	Quick response
1437	pos	Using it for CAD operation
1438	pos	Fantastic, comfortable, responsive
1438	pos	I also love the button that turns on and off the mouse wheel gears
1439	pos	Lo compre para un amigo como regalo y siempre me dice que es el mejor que ha tenido
1440	pos	a bit pricey, but deffinetly worth it
1440	pos	i love it
1441	neg	It was a great mouse up until the laser stopped working right
1441	neg	Mouse mat or no and just randomly decides to fly off wherever after a few minutes
1441	neg	Really disappointing
1442	pos	Everything about this mouse is great
1442	pos	I definitely recommend this mouse to anyone who games especially with the adjustable weights
1442	pos	Fits great on my big hand and the free scroll wheel toggle is awesome
1442	pos	The only thing is that the three primary lights on top of the logo are not working and haven't worked since i got the mouse about a month ago, even with the Logitech G Hub software which is great
1442	pos	However, I do not really mind since the performance is excellent
1443	neg	I hate to write this review
1443	neg	I loved this mouse, but lately it is not usable for gaming
1443	neg	The switch in the right mouse button is faulty
1443	neg	In most shooters the right mouse button is aim down sight
1443	neg	While holding down the RMB it flickers causing me to pull out of sights unexpectedly
1443	neg	I really expected better switches out of such a reputable mouse
1444	neg	It was a pretty good mouse
1444	neg	Compared to other Logitech mice, I thought this one was price well for its quality
1444	neg	Well, I guess I was wrong
1444	neg	The mouse started to double click and now it's gotten worse
1444	neg	Super annoying to try to play FPS games with it
1444	neg	I hope to get a replacement for it soon
1445	pos	It's a solid mouse for gaming
1445	pos	The only complaint is how heavy it is compared to other options out there
1446	neg	Not a fan of buying ‚Äúgamer‚Äù products, but this was was just plain broken because of the over engineering that went into the mouse wheel (MB3)
1447	pos	After 6 months of use, the mouse is double clicking
1447	pos	It seems like a reoccurring problem in newer gaming mice
1447	pos	As this mouse was replacing a Razer mouse that started doing the same thing after 1 1/2 years of use
1447	pos	I'm really disappointed in the quality of the mouse
1448	pos	It is Very comfortable in my hand for a long gaming session, and with the adjustable weights it can be the perfect mouse for any gamer
1448	pos	The only problem I can think of is that LGHUB is not the easiest thing to use and was very outputting for me at first
1449	pos	For the price its awesome
1449	pos	I know a lot of you don't like wired mice but I think they are more reliable and longer lasting
1450	pos	This is the best mouse i‚Äôve come in contact with
1450	pos	Everything about it is perfect
1450	pos	If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this mouse, you very well should
1450	pos	If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this for your child, you should
1450	pos	They will love you even more
1451	neg	Logitech gaming software doesn't support thisYou have to download the hug and it's annoying as heck to use
1452	pos	Bueno
1453	pos	LOVE this mouse
1453	pos	Had the older version and was gonna order it again for another computer
1453	pos	Amazon recommend this newer version and OH MY GEEE I love it
1454	pos	The mouse is perfect for windows games
1454	pos	The mouse wheel is notched, so you get excellent control over scrolling
1454	pos	Very important when changing weapons quickly
1454	pos	The mouse can also be weighted
1454	pos	I found that this feature made the tracking on the mouse pad more precise as well
1454	pos	Definitely worth the money
1455	pos	Logitech is a great brand so hardly ever do they get it wrong and this mouse is no exception
1455	pos	The comfort and style of the mouse are awesome
1455	pos	The ability to adjust the weights underneath the mouse make it great for each individual user
1455	pos	100x over again I would purchase this mouse
1455	pos	The one big con I have is that the mouse cord attracts dust
1456	pos	Everything I wanted and more in a mouse for a great price
1457	pos	The media could not be loaded
1457	pos	Es buen rat√≥n la verdad si lo recomiendo para jugar ya que los botones extra son de bastante ayuda no solo para juegos si no para la escuela tener accesos r√°pidos etc y es bastante bueno si lo encuentran en oferta yo si lo recomiendo la verdad
1458	pos	Excelente inversi√≥n me gusto mucho y lo recomiendo mucho
1459	pos	Es un mouse excelente, calidad de los botones, comodidad y todo al 100, recomendado
1460	neg	Bought it because it was suppose to be good for bigger hands
1460	neg	Was way smaller then my previous mouse
1460	neg	If you have tiny hands; 1) feel bad for you 2)mouse is perfect for you
1461	neg	Wheel is loose and useless
1462	neg	Left-Click broke within 30 days of owning it
1462	neg	It double-clicks when i single-click, and can no longer hold down left-click
1462	neg	Over the years I have purchased 3 different mice, a keyboard and speakers from Logitech, and I have never seen such a horrible product shipped by them
1463	pos	I ended up cancelling to buy in-store because it was going to take too long to ship, but it is the gaming mouse for a reason
1463	pos	RGB is a nice touch, but the adjustable weight, the infinite-scroll, and high dpi sets it apart from the rest
1463	pos	Just get the mouse, man
1464	pos	I have used very basic mice in the past and this was a HUGE step up
1464	pos	For gaming, it's very responsive
1464	pos	I also use with design programs and the extra buttons are great for that
1464	pos	The only warning I would give is that it seems like it is better for palm grip
1465	pos	I honestly don't know if I get a different brand again
1466	pos	I used to use Razer deathadder for long but switched to g502
1466	pos	Got it with $40
1466	pos	No matter the wheel, button and the functionalities, it should be the best I have ever tried
1466	pos	Suggested
1467	neg	Decided to go with Logitech after being a Deathadder fan for quite some time
1467	neg	I had become unsatisfied with the build quality of Razer lately so I went with this Logitech mouse
1467	neg	After just 5 months the right mouse click has begun to flicker on and off when holding down the click
1467	neg	Making ADS impossible in all games
1467	neg	I would have been better off with the Razer, the Death adders I have owned lasted much longer
1467	neg	Don't buy Razor or Logitech overall quality has degraded significantly over the years
1468	pos	Replaced the Corsair Scimitar with this mouse
1468	pos	I love it so much more
1468	pos	I love all of the extra functions this controller has that most other mice do not have
1468	pos	(Scroll wheel tilt and smaller programmable "edge-clicker" buttons on the left side
1469	pos	All controls are easy to use with out moving more than a digit, so you are always in control
1470	pos	Very pleased with this purchase and worth every penny
1470	pos	I highly advise buying this
1471	neg	Garbage
1471	neg	Its one sale point was that it worked on any surface
1471	neg	Was DOA and factory new
1471	neg	Tech support was useless and when I sent it in for a return, I never got my money back, but for some reason the package got returned
1471	neg	Now I have an ugly paperweight
1471	neg	And I'm out of some money
1472	pos	Great feel and balance
1472	pos	Very glad I went with this mouse after trying quite a few

1473	pos	heh
1473	pos	gaming mouse go brrrr
1474	neg	This mouse is trash for the price
1474	neg	Scroll wheel flies continuously as opposed to locking in a groove so scroll bars don‚Äôt go flying
1474	neg	Mouse clicks don‚Äôt register around 1/10 the time and is pretty flimsy
1474	neg	Pretty disappointed for a $50 mouse
1475	pos	So I originally ordered the mouse to upgrade because my G602(high recommend) was a few years old
1475	pos	It‚Äôs well made, and it feels right
1475	pos	I am one to really utilize my mouse for hotkeys, and all I can say is the placement for these keys on the 502 are horrible
1475	pos	Not ideal at all compared to the 602
1476	pos	The only pseudo complaint is the lighting software didn‚Äôt give well with the Asus Aura from my MOBO, but that is just as likely an Asus issue
1477	neg	Liked the older G502 as it was nice, durable and lasted quite a long time
1477	neg	I decided to get the hero because of it and that was a mistake
1477	neg	Two months into the purchase and the mouse started having issues with its left click button to where I can't drag and drop stuff
1477	neg	Other mouses I have do the drag and drop without a problem, but it seems like the product is not as durable as its predecessor
1477	neg	Since I can't return it as it failed a month after the last return date, I'm going to leave a warning to people about this product
1478	pos	Overall just a great mouse it‚Äôs infinite scroll wheel and the ability to change the dpi are amazing the one downfall of this mouse is that it can‚Äôt double click because it has some internal cap that limits the amount of cps  (clicks per second) you can get if it wasn‚Äôt for this this would be the best mouse aside with its side buttons
1479	pos	I like the software associated with the device as well as the build quality
1480	pos	So after about a year the double click issue popped up
1480	pos	Still bought another one knowing it will do it again because it's still the best and only $40
1481	pos	Ergonomics are great on the mouse
1481	pos	But the software constantly loses the manual settings and has to be recalibrated again
1482	pos	Lots of features more than I actually needed but the I have to say this mouse is of very good quality and very precise good feel to my hand
1482	pos	I like the fact that I can change the weight for different applications
1483	pos	Last one lasted five years of pretty intense gaming and multiple users, nuff said
1484	pos	Es el mejor raton que he tenido hasta el momento, es ideal para cualquier tipo de mano y cumple con todas las espectativas, lo √∫nico malo si se podr√≠a decir as√≠ es el configurarlo con su propia aplicaci√≥n de Logitech porque es muy poco intuitiva, pero de resto es 100% recomendable
1485	pos	Great mouse for working from home
1486	pos	The G502 is famous for being a great gaming mouse for only 40 dollars
1486	pos	I am not blown away by it's performance, but I am also in no way disappointed either
1486	pos	Great build, and Logitechs software is much better than other brands like Razer
1487	pos	Been using this mouse for about 4 months
1487	pos	Still feels new as the first day and I use it for almost 6hrs a day everyday
1487	pos	No complaints
1488	neg	There are two things that a computer mouse is required to do - move the pointer, and click
1488	neg	This mouse can only do one of those things correctly
1488	neg	Do not buy it
1489	pos	I have been looking at this mouse for a while and heard great things about it
1489	pos	As soon as I saw it on sale I took the opportunity to get it
1489	pos	Although the mouse is fully functional I found out that the gliding pads were to shallow for my mousepad therefore making it feel like dragging sandpaper across my desk
1489	pos	Other than that I can't complain but will continue to use my Corsair m65 as my main
1490	neg	This thing barely made it three months before dying so hard my PC wouldn't boot with it plugged in
1490	neg	Support took 3 days to reply to my email with a form letter asking them to email back with the same details from my original email
1491	pos	‚Äú100/100‚Äù from my son says it‚Äôs the best mouse for gaming
1491	pos	Highly recommends
1492	neg	EDIT: changing my review to 1 star because this mouse broke after 8 months of consistent use (started randomly clicking)
1493	neg	Couldn't get it to work with any of my games
1494	pos	This Mouse was great for about 3 or 4 months when I noticed that the left mouse button would stop inputting randomly
1494	pos	I really noticed when shooting in games like Overwatch
1494	pos	I would have to click several times to do anything
1494	pos	It was great until then
1494	pos	Hopefully Logitech will help me with getting a replacement
1494	pos	But otherwise it worked fine
1494	pos	Just wanted to let everyone know of the issue I had
1495	pos	I‚Äôve been one of those people who said a mouse is a mouse as long as it moves the pointer I am good but I have never been more comfortable with a mouse than this oneWith a mouse pad it feels so smooth to move the mouse I really like it
1496	neg	Great mouse in theory but I've been through 3 of them now and every time the click buttons break
1496	neg	they definitely did not make these to last longer than 1 year
1496	neg	Disappointing
1497	pos	I got this product a month ago January 15th and have loved every second
1497	pos	People said it was heavy but i ended up putting all the weights in because i dont think its that heavy
1497	pos	In total good product
1497	pos	10/10
1498	pos	Funciona a la perfecci√≥n
1499	neg	Utterly trash software and you can‚Äôt even change the dpi the slider of it it‚Äôs never on point
1499	neg	I have it way to my cousins day after I got it
1499	neg	Razor supreme
1500	pos	We love our apple products, but the mouse was so hard to use
1500	pos	We replaced the apple mouse with this one and we are thrilled
1500	pos	So nice and my son loves it for gaming
1501	pos	I've been using this mouse for a year now, I love everything about it
1501	pos	The only thing I would change about this mouse is an extra button or two and increase the size a little
1501	pos	The price for this mouse is absolutely fantastic and makes it worth buying it 100%
1502	pos	This mouse was the best mouse that I ever used
1502	pos	So comfortable in the hand and it had many aspects that will give you the best experience
1502	pos	The only problem is that in about 1 year the mouses left button will become an issue
1502	pos	Sometimes it will not respond when you use it
1502	pos	But other than that Logitech is the best brand from mouses keyboards and headsets
1503	pos	I love this mouse
1503	pos	I use it for work and gaming
1503	pos	Only issue I have with it is that I'll accidentally hit the mode switch and have to cycle back to the correct mode for whatever I'm doing
1503	pos	But besides that it's great
1503	pos	I work in imaging and having the ability to unlock the wheel is a huge plus
1503	pos	For gaming it has just enough buttons for my MMOs
1503	pos	They are placed just right in the mouse for use
1503	pos	Also being able to adjust the weight helps a lot for more precise gaming like fps
1504	neg	The right click is failing to respond when pressed, it is hit or miss if it will activate upon clicking
1505	pos	I wasn't sure if this was a good purchase as I wasn't too sure if buying a better mouse would make a difference
1505	pos	Honestly this mouse is beyond amazing
1505	pos	I had a 10 dollar gaming mouse before this and this is a massive step up
1505	pos	The tracking of the mouse is amazing, the size and shape are perfect
1505	pos	The weight is also not an issue which is one thing I considered alot when picking out the new mouse
1505	pos	It feels smooth and precise in whatever I am doing on my pc
1506	neg	Wouldn't work without proprietary software (never mentioned, support team told me about it) and this week they pushed an update
1506	neg	when they did, peripherals stopped working
1506	neg	Had to stop the machine which is an active server, with upset clients, all because I need updated proprietary software just to operate a mouse
1507	pos	If you plan to use it for gaming
1507	pos	Pass
1507	pos	The mouse wheel is hard plastic and has zero grip to your finger
1507	pos	As a day in day out mouse it is even aggravating it‚Äôs so slick
1508	neg	Great mouse but my scroll wheel just quit working
1508	neg	No it's not the locked scroll wheel
1508	neg	I physically can't scroll after owning it for not even two years
1508	neg	Not the first time it's happened
1508	neg	Wouldn't recommend based on this
1509	pos	This mouse is easy to set up and fits your hand perfectly
1509	pos	No slipping off the mouse or reposition needed
1509	pos	Also the rgb is nice without being distracting
1509	pos	Definitely worth the money
1510	pos	Overall, i love the mouse
1510	pos	BUT, after not even using it that long, the left click sometimes isn't responding to my click
1510	pos	Which sucks since my main game i play is Rainbow Six Siege
1511	pos	such a nice mouse
1511	pos	haven‚Äôt had any problems all the buttons are nice
1511	pos	the weights are awesome
1511	pos	the dpi pre sets are awesome
1511	pos	everything about this mouse is just amazing
1511	pos	no matter what level of gaming or just office work you‚Äôre doing this mouse is for you
1512	pos	The shape of this mouse is everything
1512	pos	Not the actual look of it (which is fine anyway) but the feel of it is great because it fits in my small hands perfectly
1512	pos	At first, I was a little skeptical about this mouse because the scroll wheel is so loose, but I warmed up to it in a few hours
1513	pos	Bought this a while ago on recommendation from a friend
1514	pos	Love how it feels and with the app there's a wide variety of settings for it
1514	pos	Definitely happy with my purchased and I've had it for over a month now
1515	pos	I got this mouse as an upgrade to my Razer deathadder which was on it's last legs and this mouse is awesome
1515	pos	The ability to add weights is great, you can rebind all of the buttons, and it's very ergonomic
1515	pos	Worth the price
1516	pos	Would totally recommend it, the sensor is really good, great build quality and it's confortable to use for many hours, the cable is not heavy at all and all the extra buttons come in handy in almost every game for shortcuts
1517	neg	My mouse clicks 2 times for ever 1 click on the left button
1517	neg	This makes it pretty much unusable
1517	neg	I tried contacting logitech but they just gave me a standard email to try a million things software related
1517	neg	It's definitely a mechanical issue
1517	neg	Broke after a couple months of ordering it
1518	pos	My teen son loves this mouse for gaming, specially for playing Minecraft
1518	pos	It was the only affordable option, so I‚Äôm pleased with the quality given the cost
1519	pos	Logitech mouses are notorious
1519	pos	Ive loved every logi mouse I have got and have never had problems
1519	pos	Thats why I stay will logi and don't buy Corsair or other brands because logi always works no matter what
1520	pos	Now I know why my friend kept calling it the best mouse for gaming, haha
1521	pos	Lets see how long this one lasts
1522	pos	If you're like me, you're looking to get into PC gaming and your head is spinning with all the different options and "top ten" lists from tech websites and you just want something that guaranteed to be all that you need without breaking the bank
1522	pos	This is it
1522	pos	There's an entire subreddit dedicated to how great this mouse is
1522	pos	There's not a whole lot else to say
1523	pos	Very Ergonomic Mice for Gaming
1524	pos	The mouse is great and the downloadable software support is amazing
1524	pos	I personally just wish the mouse was slightly wider in size
1524	pos	I however have enormous hands
1524	pos	The buttons are extremely handy
1525	neg	I bought this mouse in March, and played COD for 3 month, and then it's defected, primary click can't hold, means I can't shot anymore
1525	neg	Very pool quality
1526	pos	I've ordered this product before
1526	pos	Last time, the cord had a kink in it that resulted in the writing getting messed up
1526	pos	This time, however, it's in perfect condition
1526	pos	Great mouse
1527	pos	My brother loved it
1527	pos	Used it for his gaming
1528	neg	Buttons stopped working well and the clicks were super annoying
1528	neg	The design does look cool in the picture but in reality when you get a good view it does look a bit weird
1529	neg	Bought this mouse to hopefully end a cycle of replacing cheap mice with other cheap mice that wear out just as fast, but this mouse failed even faster
1529	neg	That alone makes this mouse impossible to recommend, but it's also uncomfortable to hold
1529	neg	If there's a mouse that's worth spending more money on, it's not this one
1530	pos	I really like this mouse
1530	pos	The additional buttons allow for a bunch of options, and the software that you download for it makes it really easy to customize it to how I play
1530	pos	Also, the per-game/program custom settings make it really easy to have different profiles for whatever you're doing
1530	pos	I even used it for excel spreadsheets and miss having it at work
1531	pos	Best gaming mouse ever
1531	pos	So smooth
1532	pos	This mouse is smooth, responsive and feels great
1532	pos	I recommend it
1533	pos	Awesome mouse, love the side buttons and the ability to change the speed In game
1534	pos	Was a very nice upgrade
1535	pos	Ive had the same base model of this mouse for many many years
1535	pos	This one is just not as good
1535	pos	The side to side mouse button (which i use a lot) is way way to sensitive and trigger way way way to easily
1536	neg	works well
1536	neg	fits my hand really nicely
1536	neg	But it's just way too heavy
1537	pos	I now have two of these mice, one I game with and one I use for work
1537	pos	They are reliable (Had one for a year now and other one for a month or so) smooth, and easy to hold in your hand
1537	pos	I definitely recommend it for any use; work, gaming, school, etc
1537	pos	10/10 great product
1538	pos	Perfect love ir
1539	pos	Great mouse for everyday work of gaming
1539	pos	My teenage son is very happy
1539	pos	This will last long time, better spend money to get good quality than keep buying cheap product
1540	pos	perfect except the buttons on the side bump SOOOO easily and close videos and crap on me all the time
1541	pos	Best mouse I have ever had
1541	pos	Fully customizable with the g hub app
1541	pos	DPI settings are great and the customizable buttons on the mouse are perfectly placed
1541	pos	I like somewhat heavier mice and this feels great
1542	neg	how this mouse got over 4 stars rating
1542	neg	this is A junk
1542	neg	dont buy
1542	neg	i dont understand who made it, but how come they put left click and dpi button are in the same spot loli dont who design, but i am so sure this is very very not gooddont buyand they said i can custom button function hahahow nice answer
1543	neg	I got this around 8 months ago and the left click sometimes doesn't work and sometimes it double clicks really fast, my razor last like 3+ years everything else it's fine but durability is not one of them
1544	pos	Finally had to replace my old G502 after over 7 years, one button finally failedI got an extra one just to keep in my closet if I ever need another
1545	pos	The mouse worked perfectly up until recently, one of the side buttons and the left mouse click have been getting stuck and are having issues holding
1545	pos	I use these buttons on a daily basis so it makes sense that they‚Äôve stopped working properly but I‚Äôd hoped it would have lasted a bit longer
1546	pos	Good
1547	pos	Perfectly built for beginner gamers
1547	pos	I bought thiss cause every wireless mouse I bought had a lag
1547	pos	This turned out great
1547	pos	If you‚Äôre a fan of lighter mice this might not be the option for you because this is known to be the hefty one among the pro gamers
1548	pos	I really like this mouse I like it's feel and how customizable it is in terms of weight
1548	pos	The rgb G logo is a nice touch and the software for the mouse it also very good
1549	pos	Excellent gaming mouse for a very, very VERY good price
1549	pos	I almost don't notice the cord when gaming 10/10GHub Works well, anyone how's saying otherwise needs to take a little bit of time to learn how to use it
1550	pos	I have already owned the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, so the upgrade to the G502 Hero was an easy choice for me
1550	pos	Ergonomically, I wish the right side of the mouse was a bit wider so that my pink is't constantly hanging off
1550	pos	The better DPI and improved optical sensors do seem noticeable to me
1550	pos	My biggest issue with this purchase was that the product came clearly repackaged
1550	pos	I was expecting a brand new, unwrapped product but this product has clear signs of use
1551	pos	Great mouse
1551	pos	Good dpi settings and very smooth scrolling
1551	pos	Software for this is great uses very little resources
1551	pos	Only gripe is the mouse wheel feel; it feels spongy
1552	pos	I like how this product has tons of extra macros buttons to press, perfect for creating hot keys and for gaming
1552	pos	First one broke due to my own error but this mouse is very nice, a great gaming mouse and is still good for browsing
1552	pos	The one thing I dislike is how easy the macro buttons can be bumped, not a big deal just a little annoying at times
1553	pos	The only downside I have to this product is the button behind the scroll wheel
1553	pos	It is far too sensitive and makes accidental bumps a common occurrence
1553	pos	Otherwise this is by far the best mouse I have ever owned
1553	pos	Absolutely love it
1554	pos	Great mouse for gaming
1554	pos	Good quality
1555	pos	It's a mouse that is reliable and functions well
1555	pos	What else is there to say
1556	pos	a clever mouseÔºåBut I returned it because it's not work well with MacBook
1556	pos	the introduction should mention that
1557	pos	Logitech is elite
1557	pos	This mouse is no different
1557	pos	Not only is great in gameplay but the feel and use is superb
1557	pos	Kudos to Logitech for a great product
1558	pos	I keep destroying kids on Xbox with this mouse so they keep insulting me so I just cry every time I play with this
1559	pos	Love the extra weight that can be added
1559	pos	I usually play sniper or other builds that require a great deal of accuracy
1559	pos	Being able to add the weight to the mouse makes it much 'slower', which considerably improves accuracy
1559	pos	Love it
1559	pos	That said, logitechs gaming software kinda sucks balls, so -1 star for that
1560	pos	I went from the razor naga 2014 to this because I wanted to change it up
1560	pos	I‚Äôve been using it for world of Warcraft for a year now
1560	pos	Easy to set up and very comfortable
1560	pos	All buttons work with shift modifiers
1561	pos	It's a great mouse, the only thing I don't like about it is that the smooth scrolling button is too sensitive
1562	neg	It was a great mouse for about 6 months, and then it started double clicking during games and getting me killed
1563	pos	I've been through many of these
1563	pos	You get 1-2 drops from the desk before it malfunctions or is completely unusable
1564	pos	Really cool, Has a bunch of buttons
1564	pos	You can push the scroll wheel to different sides as buttons and you can change its settings to free-scroll by clicking a button right next to it, Has a bunch of colors, comes with weighs you can pop in to make the mouse heavier if you want
1564	pos	Worth every penny
1565	neg	left clicker wore out really quickly
1565	neg	middle mouse wheel can spin but it only registers it for a brief moment and then stops while wheel is still spinning
1566	pos	This mouse is very comfortable to hold
1566	pos	Easy to reach specialty buttons, removable weights to change how heavy it is, and a nice ball bearing mouse wheel feature to allow a non-stop roll with just one swift swipe down
1567	neg	Those saying that Logitech quality has fallen off are absolutely right
1567	neg	I'm a relatively heavy computer user
1567	neg	In the past I've had the G303, the M500, and various other mice in the $15-$40 range
1567	neg	They normally last 14-18 months; even the $15 cheapy from Walmart
1567	neg	Paid almost $55 for this one and in 4 months the buttons are randomly not clicking, double clicking, and letting go halfway through a drag
1567	neg	Very disappointing
1567	neg	Don't waste your money
1568	pos	My son told me that his Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB gaming mouse would not scroll
1568	pos	He asked for a new mouse
1568	pos	This Logitech G502 was not the same as what he had
1568	pos	It is better
1568	pos	He likes it a lot more than his previous mouse
1568	pos	I use Logitech peripherals and figured it would be a good choice for his gaming needs
1569	neg	Trash mouse with trash double click problem after 5 months just like trash razer mice, so annoying
1570	pos	The mouse is bound to fail there is a know issue with the switches they use
1570	pos	mine failed after 1 and a half years
1571	pos	Great mouse for the price
1571	pos	This is my second G502 hero now
1571	pos	Only issue I had
1571	pos	The slides went bad on my first one after a year of use
1571	pos	And my second one the slides went bad after one month
1571	pos	I had to buy after market slides to fix the mouse and now it works great
1572	pos	Our son needed a new mouse for gaming and he said he loves this one
1573	pos	Excellent product
1574	pos	The scroll wheel is pretty rough and feels kinda had
1574	pos	Everything else is fantastic
1574	pos	The cord is great
1575	neg	Macros containing Ctrl, Alt, or Shift will not work with on-board memory
1575	neg	It's a known bug and Logitech hasn't done anything for months to address it
1575	neg	Edit: You can get it to work if you use their older software
1576	pos	I have 5 of these at home
1576	pos	They are great and I like the weight of them and how easily they glide
1576	pos	Very responsive and the programmable buttons do what I need them for
1576	pos	Great mouse for sure
1577	pos	is all you got to worry about watch that driver software
1578	pos	Very nice looking and works great just a great item overall
1579	pos	I ordered this a while ago in the second half of 2019
1579	pos	Just this last week, I was no longer able to hold right-click
1579	pos	It ended up thinking I was pressing it really fast instead of holding it
1579	pos	It also seems that this is a recurring problem for this specific mouse
1579	pos	I hope it gets fixed soon cause it is otherwise an excellent mouse
1580	neg	It was great for the first week but then the scroll wheel stopped working
1581	pos	Pretty happy with it
1581	pos	Replaced my previous G series mouse from years ago
1581	pos	Weight is shifted more towards the middle
1581	pos	The fabric cord has very little drag
1581	pos	If you're familiar with the g series line, it's definitely the high end of that wheel house
1582	pos	Click* spinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnIt works good for high level comp FPS games too I guess
1583	pos	I use this for gaming and it's just a solid all around mouse
1583	pos	Software to customize the dpi is easy fits in my hand nicely and custom weighting it really nice
1584	pos	I bought the mouse in February, and I expected it to last about another two years, as my last Logitech mouse did
1584	pos	But I was experiencing problems with the right click button in less than 6 months
1584	pos	I tried to buy my old mouse but it was unavailable
1584	pos	Don't buy this mouse
1585	pos	My new favorite mouse
1585	pos	Fits my hand great and has a customizable weight
1585	pos	All the buttons you could want and you can easily customize it with the software
1586	pos	Works good
1586	pos	Good for gaming and daily use
1587	pos	Using it now; No complaints
1588	pos	Been using it ever sence I got and seems to be working fine so far
1589	neg	My LMB does not register while being held down
1589	neg	It will click once, but when attempting to drag an item across my desktop, or dragging a screen, it requires several clicks and short drags
1589	neg	Would not buy again
1590	pos	It was a gift for my grandson and he loves it
1591	pos	Excelente calidad precio, recomendado
1592	pos	Best mouse I've ever used, the overall feel is great
1592	pos	The thumb rest makes moving the mouse feel effortless
1592	pos	This mouse glides very smooth across the insignia mouse pad I use
1592	pos	Nice and lightweight
1592	pos	I just bought a second one for an additional computer
1592	pos	I hope Logitech never stops making this model
1593	pos	After buying a few different mice, none of them compare to this one
1593	pos	I absolutely love it
1594	pos	It was easy to hold and slide on pad
1595	pos	Best mouse you can get for the price
1595	pos	It's got the looks and a nice feel when gaming, but I would say it's for people with bigger hands so it may not be for everyone
1596	pos	I‚Äôve used this mouse for a very long time and the extra buttons always come in handy, and the quick dpi as well as the spinning wheel are very useful
1597	pos	Was great while it lasted but the left and right buttons just stopped working after about 6 months of use
1598	pos	MY SON LOVE IT, GIFT
1599	pos	Absolutely my favorite mouse I've ever used
1599	pos	Using all the weights feels great for gaming and work
1599	pos	Extreme customization options, great paired with G910 keyboard üëç
1600	neg	It's just not comfortable
1600	neg	I've used many mouses since the 90s and this is one of the least comfortable I've touched
1600	neg	You can't easily do the lift, it doesn't work well on many surfaces
1600	neg	Just a bad mouse all around
1601	pos	Love the mouse its actually my second one I had bought first one just died was less then 1 month old and had no damage it just died
1601	pos	But amazon reps were great and offered me a refund which I used to purchase a replacement and it has been great
1601	pos	Mouse feels great and Logitech seems to have pretty good software
1602	neg	Mouse didn't last very long
1602	neg	The majority of mice I've used have lasted me more than 2 years
1602	neg	As for this one, problems arose not even 3 months later
1602	neg	The mouse was giving me problems such as double clicking, not clicking, and getting stuck
1602	neg	The mouse finally gave out, and the left mouse button broke off and is completely unusable
1602	neg	Unfortunate, given the marketing of the mouse and what it's mean to do
1602	neg	It was perfect until 3 months later
1603	pos	It took me about one week to finally settle on a mouse which was the G502 Hero
1603	pos	So I bought it as soon as I could, I must say it is great
1603	pos	Just the way it fits in my hand it couldn't be more perfect
1603	pos	One thing about buying it is when I opened the package I ended up getting the G502 SE Hero
1603	pos	Which is the version of it that has a silver scroll wheel and white strips on the mouse
1603	pos	Even though it was a mistake I'm happier with the SE because it looks great
1604	pos	Ive had this mouse for almost two years, and I've had very few issues until recently
1604	pos	The mouse has started double-clicking (2 clicks for the price of one)
1604	pos	This is pretty disappointing since Logitech is known for its longevity, and I'm well past the return period
1604	pos	A great mouse, but when it goes downhill, it does it in a very noticeable way
1605	pos	This is good for my son to use, it is very sensitive
1605	pos	He likes it very much
1606	pos	This is my second G502 mouse the first one lasted for many years and worked great
1607	pos	The mouse works amazing, great sensor and too quality software
1607	pos	My recommendation is to buy it only from Amazon, I bought one from an associate and they sent me something used so be careful
1608	pos	I can't give this mouse less than 5 stars
1608	pos	Although I personally ended up changing to a lightweight mouse, the G502 it's great for gamers
1608	pos	If you play fps with low dpi though, stick with a lightweight mouse, your wrists will thank you
1609	pos	Really good mouse
1609	pos	My only issues with them have been the wheele gives out a bit to easy
1610	pos	the mouse works perfectly, it is super sensitive, its software is very user friendly and the weights make it really comfortable
1611	neg	every single button on the mouse (left, right, middle, and all of the side buttons) started to double/triple click on a single press after a couple months of use
1611	neg	customer support and the warranty i got were entirely useless, so now I just have a broken brick of a mouse that i can't return/replace or use
1611	neg	nice
1612	pos	Good mouse for price
1613	neg	This mouse has a sleek design that fits in my hand nicely
1613	neg	The mouse works awesome and the customizability with the Logitech software is amazing
1613	neg	However, a major issue that I have with the mouse is it randomly disconnects when I‚Äôm using it
1613	neg	This issue really bumps down the rating because what good is a mouse design if the functionality is not there
1613	neg	I‚Äôve used it on a several laptops and computers, and the issue still occurs
1613	neg	Not sure what‚Äôs wrong with the mouse
1614	neg	This mouse started having double click issues and issues with not being able to drag and drop items after about one month randomly, as time went on it became consistent
1614	neg	Now I'll have to attempt to get ahold of Logitech for an RMA replacement, this is a huge waste of time, and I've had to go buy a cheap Walmart mouse just to get by in the interim
1614	neg	üò†
1615	pos	I would prefer they had a little finger rest as my hand gets tired holding it up during lengthy sessions
1615	pos	The buttons are responsive
1615	pos	I fail to see the advantage of the little weights included
1616	neg	The absolutely horrible switches will only last you a matter of months
1616	neg	So if you are looking for a mouse that you have to replace every few months, go ahead and buy this
1617	pos	The weights really don't do much for me but they're a neat little feature
1617	pos	I love the extra side buttons
1617	pos	I would say that if you have a bigger hand that would work better for a couple of the top buttons
1617	pos	But quality is great, cord is nice and long so I can have my pc a good ways away from where I'm using the device
1618	pos	what more can i say
1618	pos	works great
1618	pos	if you are not a gamer though
1618	pos	you don't really need this
1619	neg	So, I got this gaming mouse after reading great reviews
1619	neg	At first it seemed great, but just after a few months, the left click button becomes inconsistently activated, which not only aggravated day to day work, but makes high stakes FPS not feasible for the hardcore gamers
1620	pos	Owned the G502 Proteous Spectrum and decided to buy this, not much of a change but when I bought this, the wireless G502 was released after a few days of buying it
1620	pos	There isn't really a big change between the old model and the new model
1621	pos	Best mouse I ever used in a while
1622	neg	Bought June 2019, in roughly a year the house has begun to double click, I can‚Äôt recommend based on how quickly it broke down
1622	neg	Ergonomics are fine, while it was working properly the mouse was fine however I woulden‚Äôt purchase a second time as the product does not withstand regular use
1622	neg	I am looking elsewhere for my replacement and would suggest looking elsewhere to potential buyers
1623	pos	Used for gaming
1623	pos	Buttons are well placed, function great
1623	pos	strong positive click
1623	pos	Programming is easy, and versatile
1623	pos	Weight system is interesting, but it not a "fine tune" I put all the weights in, and it felt fine
1623	pos	The DPS adjustment had a bigger impact on playability
1624	neg	This mouse was so close to being perfect
1624	neg	HOWEVER, this double clicking is a major issue
1624	neg	I can't drag anything without it unclicking
1624	neg	Makes it hard to game and working in DAW
1624	neg	So close to being perfect
1624	neg	I researched how to fix this problem but turns out, it happens on all G502 hero
1624	neg	Funny that's what it's called, CAUSE I WISH I SAVED MY MONEY
1625	pos	This mouse is amazing didn‚Äôt get any issues YET, the mouse is a little heavy which is fine for me and it can drag click it also has it‚Äôs own software, the build quality is great, it is good for small hands ( i guess
1625	pos	) really recommend
1626	pos	I have been waiting to get this mouse for a bit and now that I have it so pleased with it and it meets all my expectations great quality really if you are looking for a superior mouse this is it
1627	pos	Pros:Feels premiumOutstanding main buttonsScroll wheel has two modesCons:HeavyNotched scroll wheel is clunkyFree wheel scroll mode is odd
1628	pos	This product is under rated for both price and quality
1628	pos	Definitely worth $40
1629	neg	If you wanna waste your money I'm some thing, This the right thing
1629	neg	It was good for at least 2 months
1629	neg	Suddenly, it started to miss clicks, from both buttons
1629	neg	The cursor started to miss the point click precision and finally it stopped working, just like that
1630	pos	One of the highest quality gaming mice I‚Äôve had the pleasure of purchasing
1630	pos	I frequently play rainbow six siege/cs:go/Fortnite competitively and this mouse has ABSOLUTELY made a difference
1630	pos	Feels very sturdy and premium and very comfortable to use as a dude with slightly bigger hands
1630	pos	100% a must buy in my opinion if you are even slightly a pc gaming enthusiast
1631	pos	Comfortable to hold and use mouse
1631	pos	Decent amount of extra buttons for binding keys
1631	pos	Only complaint is the wheel is super fragile
1631	pos	You barley bump it and it rotates
1631	pos	Also clicking the buttons too hard and cause the single to be sent through the wheel and it scrolls when you don't want it to
1632	pos	im currently using this as my fornite mouse, easy to bind buttons but its a heavier mouse making it a little harder to flick but better to have weight to slide
1633	neg	I love the mouse it fits my hand perfectly and the buttons are in convenient spots but the accidental double clicking ruins any type of consistency for gaming and also navigating web pages and such its just annoying
1634	pos	My son loves this mouse
1634	pos	lol
1635	pos	This is definitely a 5 star mouse
1635	pos	The double click issue is long gone and the mouse is perfect now
1635	pos	The software is extremely open, and lets me customize the mouse fully
1635	pos	It fits in my hand perfectly, and the only complaint I would have is that the button spacing is a little annoying at times, but it just takes getting used to
1636	pos	this mouse is great for larger hands, feels good, buttons take a bit to get used to but can be useful for fps games along with the weights
1637	pos	Fits my hand perfectly, and the weight is perfect with the included weights
1638	pos	I have a hard, tip-grip and have problems usually with button placement around thumb
1638	pos	Not with this mouse
1638	pos	I can dig in my thumb to my hearts content
1638	pos	Perfect weight
1638	pos	Responsive
1638	pos	Yah, great mouse, but these things do depend on your grip and own taste
1639	pos	Decent price for a nice mouse
1639	pos	Great for gaming, nice software allows pretty easy customization (macros and whatnot), and ergonomic for everyday use: working or gaming, personally feels nice to me
1640	pos	Great quality works amazingly I mean if you are looking at this mouse you should know how good anything Logitech is and it definitely keeps that great standard
1641	pos	Lasted me longer than any other mouse (almost a year), and very nice
1641	pos	Takes a good week of getting used to, but once you do it's like butter in your hands
1641	pos	If you just want a nice durable gaming mouse, look no further than this one
1642	pos	I dont need to adjust my dpi so this isnt very useful
1643	pos	Good product
1643	pos	But the wheel is too sensitive
1644	neg	I want to like this, but the driver applications they make you install DOES NOT WORK on the Apple M1 laptop
1644	neg	You won't be able to use it, so you'll be missing out on like 80% of the features you're paying for
1644	neg	Spend your money elsewhere
1645	neg	I‚Äôve only had this thing for a couple months now and every 5-10 minutes while using the Logitech program it gives me a ‚Äú backend connection issues ‚Äú I have tried ever vacant slot on my pc to no avail
1645	neg	This is a problem that is going on with a lot of my friends as well who have this mouse
1645	neg	This is very annoying and I expected more from a high end mouse I spent my money on
1645	neg	I wasted a lot of money on this and got screwed in the long run
1646	neg	Right mouse button sticks causing delays
1646	neg	If you are gaming, this is a pretty big deal
1647	neg	The box seems to be tampered with and opened maybe
1647	neg	I haven't opened the mouse and the box it self is old and oily i think i got a used version
1647	neg	Logitech is supposed to be a good brand and I have a keyboard from them but i don't know how I got sent a used product
1647	neg	Hopefully we can work something out :/
1648	pos	The weights and software to edit all buttons the way I like are great
1648	pos	It's the perfect spot for those that do not quite want all the buttons the Razor Naga's have but need more than a standard mouse
1649	pos	It's a magnificent product that you can modify in weight, I personally have only 1 in it at the moment and it is the best Mouse I have had for everything
1649	pos	I have had from Dell's, to other logitech mice, and HyperX Mice
1649	pos	Nothing compares to this mouse
1650	pos	Bought this for my brother in law's birthday
1650	pos	Good for gaming
1651	pos	Great for gaming, easy on hands, comfortable to use
1652	pos	I've tried other mice and I ALWAYS COME BACK TO LOGI
1653	pos	Moves beautifully, feels great on the hands (which immediately made me throw my Razer Deathadder in the trash) and is INSANELY precise for gaming
1654	pos	I got this mouse for 37 dollars and it is amazing it moves really smooth and the adjustable weights actually do a little change
1654	pos	the mouse has minimum RGB but I prefer it like that because it‚Äôs not too distracting with all the lights
1655	pos	love the g502 hero best mouse ive used so far
1656	pos	I love everything about this mouse the only complaint is dpi buttons on the left mouse button get hit during hectic times on occasion I will miss click and my mouse will speed up
1657	pos	Amazing gaming mouse
1658	pos	This is by far the best mouse I've ever used
1658	pos	My only gripe is that my mouse wheel is a little loose and super sensitive, but it doesn't bother me at all
1658	pos	It's worth the money
1659	neg	Only solution that seems to show any amount of success is to replace the switch on the left-main button, or warranty it
1660	neg	you dont want this mouse it's trash
1660	neg	buy the proteus core
1661	pos	Ordered for my grandson n he loves it
1662	pos	Very comfortable to use, hate the software but overall the mouse quality is good, i like how you can adjust the weight
1663	pos	My son is a computer gamer and he absolutely loves this mouse
1663	pos	Its exactly what he expected for the price and is very happy
1663	pos	No complaints and would purchase this item again if needed
1664	neg	I had the G502 Proteous Core and the Right Mouse button started to fail
1664	neg	I then bought the G502 HERO to replace it and in less than a year the same issue happened
1664	neg	Right Mouse button fails on click, for gaming specifically it sucks massively
1664	neg	I used to love Logitech Mice, but I cannot recommend this one anymore
1664	neg	1/10
1665	pos	Only dislike is that I'm not a fan of the weird rubber/svelte material that your thumb rests on, the feel is strange and neither slippery or sticky, somewhat fails to have friction with the thumb
1665	pos	Also, the button in front of the thumb is too close, and I have small hands
1666	pos	Its the g502, fits in your hand well and has good features
1666	pos	Good mid range mouse
1667	pos	que buen mouse encantado mas de un a√±o de uso en gaiming
1668	pos	I finally dumped Razer after having so many issues with scroll wheel clicking and the reviews around this mouse seemed fine
1668	pos	I got my first one and the middle click was broken and I would double click so I went through all the absurd trouble to mail it back
1668	pos	I got my replacement a week later and the same issue
1668	pos	These mice suck and the middle mouse click is trash
1669	pos	I like  it
1670	neg	The right click does not hold down at random times and support is useless
1671	pos	I like how simple it is to change its settings
1671	pos	All you need to do is download logitech hub and itll auto discover your logitech device if its plugged in or connected
1671	pos	It's very simple to change the buttons of the mouse and actually nice to have the extra weights in case you want a heavier or lighter mouse
1672	neg	My last g502 I replaced because the clickers got soft on the left click
1672	neg	This replacement did exactly the same thing in literally 6 months
1672	neg	Awful quality
1673	pos	I liked this mouse, cause so presised aiming and you can also change sensivity of the mouse, by using buttons, that attached to the mouse
1673	pos	Realy love this one
1673	pos	Also, do not forget to install "Logitech G" app to see more things, that ghis mouse can do
1674	pos	Mouse so good I‚Äôve bought 3
1674	pos	Works great with no issues, programming is easy with the Logitech software
1674	pos	I recommend this to anyone and everyone
1675	neg	The mouse is fine except for the fact that I had to tear it apart twice to fix the left and right mouse button
1675	neg	The buttons were double-clicking when I barely held them down and was making it impossible to play most games
1675	neg	I had to manually take apart the mouse and fix the switches
1675	neg	Ergonomically, the mouse is very comfortable
1676	neg	This mice is already heavy, and it provide extra kit to make it heavier
1676	neg	Very confusing button
1676	neg	Not recommend for gaming, I play FPS game most of time and it made me very uncomfortable
1677	pos	The media could not be loaded
1677	pos	This mouse is super fit for me, I use it to play league and Apex everyday
1678	pos	The best mouse I have for a good price
1679	neg	This is the 2nd Logitech mouse I've had where the right mouse button stopped working correctly
1679	neg	Garbage product
1679	neg	Find another brand, this one is terrible
1680	neg	See photo
1680	neg	Delivered to me like this
1681	neg	Out of the box it looked used or almost refurbished,  but still looked virtually new, so I decided to just use it
1681	neg	FIRST MISTAKE
1681	neg	After using it almost daily for about  2 months I'm getting constant double clicks
1681	neg	Seeing as I use this for gaming this has been a major pain
1681	neg	I've read this problem a lot with this mouse, good size, but bad clicks
1682	neg	after 3 months a button stopped working, I do not recommend it for games
1683	pos	Great
1684	neg	The mouse feet is cut to the edge an unsticking an the click on the mouse works on an off this is very bad I cant even use it anymore an I jus got bought it recently
1685	neg	Mouse didn't last long
1685	neg	it started having really bad double click issues after only a few months, I would avoid it
1686	pos	I liked the feel and mousewheel for casual use
1686	pos	But in intense gaming situations the mouse wheel would rattle causing issues in aiming
1686	pos	The software must be open 24/7 as well causing performance drops in some instances
1687	pos	Great mouse and is holding up very well
1687	pos	I have noticed for people not used to it, it can be very sensitive
1687	pos	I like it though
1688	neg	I loved this mouse until the left click stopped working
1688	neg	It happened pretty fast and will not hold down or allow you to drag and highlight
1688	neg	Very annoying for work and gaming
1688	neg	I did some research and it seems like a pretty common problem for this mouse
1688	neg	Screenshot shows the mouse events of just one click
1689	pos	it is not a perfect fit but is way better for someone with large hands
1689	pos	less kinking of the fingers
1689	pos	wish it was longer but that's not the fault  of the mouse
1690	neg	Scroll wheel is literally dog water
1690	neg	I don‚Äôt know why but the scroll wheel breaks so freakin easily for no reason
1690	neg	Logitech instead of adding a useless infinite scroll wheel, please just fix your scroll wheel and make it more stable
1691	neg	Within the first month an issue with the left click double clicking began
1691	neg	Then the issues with GHub started
1691	neg	I've had to uninstall and reinstall the software twice now,  and you have to open it every time you get on your computer to reload your presets
1691	neg	If it weren't for these issues I'd be happy with it, but unfortunately it's trash and I won't be buying another Logitech product
1692	pos	Very comfortable, good amount of buttons on mouse for custom keybinds
1692	pos	Weight adjustment
1692	pos	I just dont like the mouse scroll design
1692	pos	While locked in, the mouse scroll is loud to the point people on discord point it out
1692	pos	This is only when the scroll is being used with fast movement
1692	pos	Unlocking the scroll wheel removes all the noise but is super sensitive
1692	pos	I wish the default scroll was a little less noisy
1693	neg	Used Logitech product for a long time
1693	neg	Love G9X and G602, this one is pure garbage
1693	neg	And you know what
1693	neg	it couldn't even smoothly work, every time I tried to drag any folder/file I have to wait for 2s, and then spend 2s to find the mouse pointer god knows where it moves
1694	pos	I can‚Äôt even give it 4 stars because it‚Äôs such a good mouse and the quality is so great since I‚Äôve had it, however my only gripes are the software doesn‚Äôt allow DPI outside of in 50 intervals and there isn‚Äôt an extra side wing for my pinky since I have rather large hands
1694	pos	Still 5/5
1695	neg	I loved it for around 9 months, then the left and right mouse buttons stopped working/double clicking
1695	neg	its now 100% unusable
1695	neg	highly disappointed in this mouse, it should have lasted far longer for being an 80$ mouse
1696	pos	Bought for a friend as a Christmas gift
1696	pos	He loves it
1697	pos	Feels amazing, great all around
1698	pos	This a great gaming mouse, I got it to replace my old Logitech G500, and it's a perfect replacement
1698	pos	Highly recommended:)
1699	pos	Nice mouse
1700	pos	Like that it comes with weights
1700	pos	Just a nice hold for gaming
1700	pos	Good little mousey
1701	pos	Overall great feel and size
1701	pos	I loved that you can easily change the DPI (mouse cursor sensitivity)
1702	pos	Best mouse I've had at a fantastic price
1703	pos	this mouse is decent
1703	pos	it is playable and smooth but keep in mind if you used before 60gram mouse mine was g102 after this using g502 hero it's hard cause g502 is 120 gram
1703	pos	but in overall it's awesome mouse nice smooth comfy insane sensor
1704	neg	and looks like I lost product number somewhere
1704	neg	still have box but Logitech said serial number needs to be attached on mouse cord, not written on mouse box so I can't even RMA it
1704	neg	now trying to order replacement switches (Kailh GM 4
1704	neg	0) and then don't break mouse completely
1704	neg	sensor is good but
1704	neg	Logitech, next time don't waste whole budget on sensor and use decent switches please
1705	pos	Best mouse I ever used
1706	pos	Had to disable the thumb button
1706	pos	Other than that, highly recommend it
1707	pos	I like the ability to adjust the weight of the mouse, and the precise sensor
1707	pos	The overall look and feel is excellent, but the scroll wheel is my favorite part of the mouse
1708	pos	Best mouse I've used in this price range for gaming
1708	pos	Plenty of customizable and programmable features
1708	pos	Highly recommend
1709	pos	I normally use the side button of the wheel for productivity tasks, like copying and pasting, I didnt pay explicit attention when I started using it but now i dont use it because it kinda feels loose and I dont wanna break it, it may be just me being paranoic but overall the built quality its good
1710	pos	It's a great fit for my hand, I use the palm grip where i let my arm do most of the work
1710	pos	Extra buttons are always helpful
1710	pos	I was using a 10 dollar mouse before that would cramp up my hand and I no longer get those even after long hours of use
1711	pos	If I could I would remove the sniper button
1711	pos	I never use it and I don't think any game recognizes it
1712	pos	This is a great product
1712	pos	However it is really hard to grip with your fingers without hitting a button
1712	pos	So you are gripping it with your palm
1713	pos	I love the G502 line
1713	pos	So far this one is working great
1713	pos	It has already survived having liquid spilled on it once
1714	pos	good product
1715	pos	Wow
1716	pos	Very responsive , great product for price
1717	pos	Great overall mouse
1717	pos	I wish the wireless version wasn't more than twice the price though
1718	pos	Mouse is used, has dirt, smudges, and the wheel seems wobbly
1718	pos	other than that it seems like a nice mouse
1718	pos	i'll update the review after i replace it
1718	pos	Edit: Think I'll just go with something else
1719	pos	Love it
1719	pos	Works great
1719	pos	Speed is on point
1720	pos	Good quality mouse
1721	pos	GREAT PRODUCT
1721	pos	THANK YOU AMAZON, VENDORS, DELIVERY PERSONS AND ALL WHO CONTRIBUTE TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE
1722	pos	We bought two
1723	pos	Very price for what you get
1724	neg	The mouse wheel seems loose and clicks on it's own when I move the mouse too quick and the pads on the bottom are bubbling and not in good shape
1724	neg	Would not recommend and am very disappointed with the product
1725	pos	Love this mouse and the new hero sensor
1725	pos	My go to for bang for your buck mouse
1725	pos	You can add weights program buttons and love the infinite scroll wheel
1726	neg	This was a 5/5 star mouse for me until it developed the double clicking issue after only a month
1726	neg	It happens quite consistently now, making me paranoid whenever using it which makes it now useless to me
1727	pos	Amazing mouse, my son is loving it
1728	pos	Dpi up/down buttons are too close to left click button and you can easily misclick during gaming
1728	pos	There's also no finger rest on the right side of the mouse, only a thumb rest
1728	pos	This mouse is great for general use but terrible for gaming
1729	pos	I really love the feel of the mouse and it's very comfortable but after about 15 months the left click started either double clicking or whenever I would hold the button down, the mouse would release it and reclick
1729	pos	It became a real issue when trying to play games and needed to hold down the button
1730	pos	Great Product
1731	pos	Works dam good
1732	pos	Hands down the best mouse I have used
1732	pos	I also have used the Razer Basilisk and this one definitely feels better
1732	pos	The infinite scroll is addictive and a great feature
1733	neg	I Purchased this mouse in May of 2019 and the right mouse button is already malfunctioning
1733	neg	I game around 1-2 hours a day and have had $10 mice last longer than this
1733	neg	Very disappointed as my last 4 mice have been logitech
1734	pos	One of the best mice I have ever used (especially for general use) with a respectable sensor
1734	pos	It might be too heavy for some where twitch aiming is critical
1734	pos	I've bought Razer (which have an obvious planned obsolescence design in place) and the quality of the G502 is night and day compared to "gamer" brands like that
1735	pos	My son added this to his gaming computer, and he‚Äôs really pleased with it for the cost
1736	pos	I like this mouse a lot, it feels good in my hand, has very precise and quick movements
1737	pos	This mouse was worth buying
1737	pos	I loved that it came with weights and love the way the clicking sounds and feels
1737	pos	The mouse fits my hand even though my hand is kinda small
1737	pos	Very easy to use and install the driver and set up all the settings you would like
1738	pos	In my opinion, best gaming mouse on the market
1738	pos	Having 2 buttons I can bind by my thumb, then two extra next to the index, the mouse wheel has adaptive scroll from smooth to bump, it just feels and preforms flawlessly
1739	neg	Complete junk
1740	pos	the mouse itself is probably really good, but mine was shipped incomplete, it said used-very good, but it was well worn down in some places and is missing some weights and the bottom cover I have no problems with the mouse, but I‚Äôm unsatisfied with the seller
1741	pos	This, while seemingly a solid product, didn't fit my hand and is very heavy - I don't know why Logi even bothers with the weights, as it's already at the upper end of the weight scale in the realm of all mice on the market
1741	pos	Also, it's small-ish - I don't have particularly large hands, but it was hard to use given it's smallish size - UNLESS you're a claw gripper - in which case, it might be great for you - it wasn't for me - and given the above comments, I returned it
1742	neg	After you use the scroll wheel, there's like a 50% chance the scroll wheel reverses once afterward
1742	neg	Maybe I just have a defective model, either way it's terrible
1743	pos	The mouse works great
1743	pos	The people who are complaining about the scroll wheel breaking have clearly neglected to read the instructions and are misinterpreting an intended feature as a defect
1744	pos	Excelente
1745	pos	Best mouse I ever used 100%Worth it
1746	pos	Sets up easily very fast and accurate
1746	pos	The free wheel is a great feature
1746	pos	I am very pleased with it
1747	pos	Nothing to dislike
1748	pos	Been using it for my new gaming setup and it performs extremely well
1748	pos	Software is very useful and easy to use
1748	pos	I paired the mouse with my Logitech G910 Orion
1748	pos	Best peripherals I've ever used
1749	neg	Just like some other dude here mentioned, I had the same problem
1749	neg	Dented box, fingerprints on the weights, strong smell of them being oiled and scratches all over the mouse - not cool at all considering I paid the full price of 80$ and got something renewed and used which is worth 40$ at best
1749	neg	Absolutely disappointing
1750	pos	Works nice and smooth
1751	pos	As of this week, about 9 months in, started experiencing issues with double clicking
1751	pos	Thought it was a game issue, but proceeded to minimize windows instead of drag them
1751	pos	It's very nice otherwise
1751	pos	Going to see if it is still within warranty
1751	pos	I am hesitant as other have reported the double clicking issue, so I wonder if it will just happen again
1752	pos	recommended for small hands, it's pretty good for gaming and for all day use, only problem is that you have to install Logitech software to change colors on the mouse
1753	pos	The mouse feel great and is very responsive, the only draw back is the weird feel of the mouse wheel, it feel cheap
1753	pos	But overall a great mouse for the price
1754	pos	use the weights to get the optimal balance between aim and comfort
1754	pos	Perfect mouse with no driver issues  like the razor crap mouse I replaced
1754	pos	Price is right and the performance is even better
1754	pos	I have big hands but I claw mu mouse
1754	pos	If you palm it might be a little small for that
1754	pos	Otherwise awesome mouse and I would recommend it
1755	pos	only complaints about this are the mouse scroll side to side clicks are squishy and the dpi up and down could be better
1755	pos	i like rubber texture on the mouse scroll this has a slightly slippery metal
1756	neg	If you like a smaller mouse, I guess this is fine
1756	neg	But it felt terrible in my hand and the scroll wheel felt like like a piece of lead
1757	pos	Ergonomically it fits my hand well
1757	pos	I have large hands and have no problem with it
1757	pos	Adding the weights makes it feel a lot more precise and I needed that coming from a lighter mouse
1758	neg	Idk why everyone loves this mouse, at least to me it feels really weird in hand and not the most optimal gaming mouse out there
1759	neg	Purchased in October
1759	neg	Mouse lasted for barely over half a year before succumbing to the infamous "double click & drag" disease
1760	neg	Started support process on 6-12-2020 it is now 7-16-2020, had to jump thru ridiculous amounts of red tape to get it send back
1760	neg	Now they have had it since 7-6-2020 and nothing from them about getting a replacement for defective mouse
1760	neg	Unacceptable from such a well known company
1760	neg	Very displeased
1761	pos	Great mouse besides the materials and lack of software for the scrolling
1761	pos	The material for thumb rest is very difficult to clean and easy to destroy
1761	pos	I bought a second one three years later after the first one stopped working one day
1762	neg	This thing which is simply spin out of control, pin the mouse to the top of the screen, or the bottom of the screen and really mess up your orientation at random
1762	neg	It took about two months to get through logitech technical support, however, they did replace the mouse
1763	pos	I purchased this about three months ago
1763	pos	I would buy it again
1763	pos	no issues in the first three months
1764	pos	Excellent mouse for all around use
1764	pos	The sensor is excellent,  buttons are good with good clicks
1764	pos	The g hub software is good as well
1764	pos	You can set different profiles for different use cases
1764	pos	I like the aesthetics too
1764	pos	I like being able to adjust the weight and balance of the mouse
1765	pos	Button positioning is excellent but runs a little short for long hands, wrist is left exposed and exerts pressure on mouse-pad unless you hold it up
1766	neg	The mouse will stop shooting when playing fps games
1766	neg	It will happen every time you are shooting the enemy
1766	neg	(especially WARZONE)
1767	pos	The mouse has poor weight distribution, the mass center is high because of the heavy metal wheel, and it dangles a lot horizontally in hyper scroll mode
1767	pos	The hand gets tired quickly, the wrist hurts after gaming or working with graphics
1767	pos	Also, the right button sticks to fingers from sweat and rattles loudly
1768	neg	This thing mouse is good, my problem is that it kept double clicking after a certain point of its lifespan, the first one was after a year, then after less then 2 months the second one
1768	neg	And in my confusion I looked up if anyone else had problems and apparently it's a common problem
1768	neg	It's a good mouse but unless they fix that double click issue then I can't recommend it
1768	neg	And yes it double clicked even wired in
1769	pos	Gaming
1770	pos	Overall not a bad mouse, the materials are very premium and buttons are fully customizable with the Logitech software
1770	pos	NOTE: if you are coming from a light weight or this is your first mouse, know that even without the additional weights, this mouse might be heavier but you can get used to it
1771	pos	Good mice for the price, the Logitech ghub allows for alot of customization
1772	pos	Even improved my productivity after getting these
1772	pos	The fantastic speed and sensitivity on this mouse makes me feel like I have never been in full control before, and now I am
1772	pos	It makes me feel alive
1773	pos	so, i have had major issues with the click and click and drag
1773	pos	cant click and drag a file around, it just releases mid move
1773	pos	really not impressed
1773	pos	put up with it long enough
1774	pos	Nothing to dislike so far
1774	pos	It appears to be very robust and responsive to inputs
1774	pos	The customization is a great addition
1775	pos	I love this mouse but download the Logitech GHUB software from a web browser
1775	pos	Makes a world of difference being able to program each button and delete the dpi changing buttons to helpful ones to game with
1776	pos	i bought  protection for my logitech g502 hero wire mouse an my mouse button are miss clicking an the mouse wheel button u push right isnt working either and the  under grip that help it slide is peeling off i tired to contact square trade website an do a claim but says it cant find it when ik i bought it for the mouse cause this was the only 2 thing i bought that day i have only had it about a year PLS HELP
1777	pos	Great gaming mouse
1777	pos	For the price this is far better than any Naga
1777	pos	Exceptional quality and functionality
1778	pos	Works great the sensor is precise enough to get me the snaps I need in game
1779	pos	For the average user I know it‚Äôs an excellent mouse
1779	pos	I have larger hands than the average person and this mouse is not made well for that, especially in the thumb area
1779	pos	The curvature is too much and my thumb doesn‚Äôt rest well and collides with the side buttons quite a bit
1779	pos	This is a personal issue yes, but one to keep in mind
1780	pos	one of the best mice ive ever used
1781	pos	beatiful cheap
1782	pos	Nothing to dislike about it at all Great quality mouse choice for a gamer been lookung for a mouse worth using but now ive found it 100% recommend for anybody looking for a great quality mouse ive had many mice but this one is def my favorite hands down
1783	neg	My son saved his money to purchase this Mouse
1783	neg	Only 1/2 the lights work
1783	neg	It arrived that way
1783	neg	Disappointing to pay $40 and not all parts work
1784	pos	Great mouse and easy to configure
1785	pos	Just wanted a few more buttons than my g203
1785	pos	This serves its purpose so far
1786	pos	4 stars for gaming because of the g hub software
1786	pos	It doesn't like to auto switch like it's supposed to
1786	pos	But the mouse itself is much better than the last gaming mouse I used
1787	neg	Left clicking and holding to drag are not working
1787	neg	The button works only intermittently
1787	neg	This mouse was bought four months ago today and now does not work
1788	pos	Very reliable mouse ,great Item
1789	neg	It actually hurt my hand on the very first day since the mouse is a lot bigger than normal sizes
1789	neg	When my hand finally adapted to it, then the wheel broke within 2 weeks of use
1789	neg	So I am returning it with a 1 star
1790	pos	I purchased this mouse 6-7 months ago, two months ago it started to randomly double click
1790	pos	The build quality and ergonomics of this mouse are good, but the double click is hard to use since I mostly use this mouse for shooting games
1790	pos	This problem may be due to an older version of the mouse, but I do not recommend buying this mouse
1791	pos	this is my second one, i had my first for over two years still works great but the fly wheel was a little worn so i bought the latest edition
1791	pos	still works great
1792	pos	I love this mouse
1792	pos	It's nice, crisp and responsive
1792	pos	I instantly noticed a difference while gaming with it and it's very comfortable to use for hours on end
1793	pos	Love this mouse and it works great
1793	pos	You can adjust the weight and program the buttons as well and I find the buttons easy to press even the ones on the side
1794	pos	The dpi buttons are right next to the left mouse button so while trying to shoot in game you may trigger the max dpi and start spinning
1795	pos	Got it for a Christmas present for my son and he absolutely loves it says it works great for all of his gaming needs
1796	pos	Amazing mouse for 40$ , you won't be disappointed
1797	pos	It's worth the upgrade from the G502 Proteus Spectrum
1797	pos	I can feel the difference in the sensor, and it is made to last longer
1798	pos	Very casual gamer here
1798	pos	Maybe play 4-8 hours a week
1798	pos	I mostly play shooters
1798	pos	The right mouse button (aim) started to not respond when clicked
1798	pos	Tried to clean with can of air
1798	pos	Took apart and cleaned with rubbing alcohol
1798	pos	Nothing worked
1799	pos	Like
1800	pos	for gaming its best
1801	pos	Can't get a better mouse for the price
1801	pos	Built well and feels comfortable
1801	pos	I like that you can add the weights to get that just right feel
1802	neg	This mouse was great out of the box and I had no problems with it until 4 months later my left click suffers from random double clicks on my single clicks
1802	neg	I have no clue how it came to this but it saddens me
1802	neg	It's still kinda usable, but the unintentional double clicks can be annoying and actually quite dangerous
1802	neg	It's quite a struggle
1803	pos	Great product for a great price
1804	pos	This device is a replacement of my old mouse
1804	pos	Much more comfortable and responsive than my old one
1804	pos	It is well built, but then again, what‚Äôs there to expect from Logitech
1805	pos	Great mouse except the wheel is very sensitive and has some left/right play in it
1805	pos	Great for web browsing/scrolling, but ex: switching weapons during gaming leaves you sometimes going past the desired selection
1806	pos	My sons used this for gaming, it react very fast , comfortable , agronomic, even afrer a lot of hours of playing their hands fills great , without any pain, another great product from Logitech technology
1807	neg	During my use of the mouse it worked great and the software was easy to use but after a year this mouse has stopped clicking consistently on the left mouse button
1808	neg	would be perfect if it was quality
1809	pos	The mouse works great and feels awesome but the little weights that come with it have a horrible vomit-like smell that stays on your hands for hours
1809	pos	all in all, good mouse
1810	pos	Good hand fit, thinner then the Corsair I was using, very light but does come with weights if your in to that sorta thing
1811	pos	It looks and feels super high quality, but the scroll wheel is rough and not very smooth, and the weights don't change it much, I'm waiting on my new mousepad because it doesn't glide well on my current one so I had to order yet another item to use it comfortably
1811	pos	Other than that, I would rate it 5‚òÖ
1812	pos	Good for gaming, however sometimes the speed is hard to balance
1812	pos	Sometimes I click the button by accident and hard to fix back
1813	pos	All around my favorite mouse but i received a 16k sensor version, probably why the price is like half off kinda drawlin but great mouse
1814	pos	Great mouse for gaming
1814	pos	It's a little on the small side for my hand so it cramps up after long sessions
1814	pos	But overall a good mouse
1815	pos	I love this mouse
1815	pos	I bought it specifically for the weights, which allows me to make it the perfect weight for sniping
1815	pos	Just a heads up - the scroll may seem broken
1815	pos	There‚Äôs a button next to the scroll to lock it
1815	pos	Thought that mine was broken until I found the button
1816	pos	Perfect
1817	pos	I like the look and feel of this mouse, for gaming, and surfing the we, --it has more than enough buttons to be assigned to all the tasks,
1818	neg	Left click stopped working
1818	neg	I can‚Äôt click and hold since the hold only registers intermittently
1818	neg	Piece of garbage now
1819	pos	Pro:-great hand feel-great weight and can adjust weight-super accurate-scroll wheel has really great tactile feedbackcons:-really need to use logitech software to get it dialed into preference
1820	pos	It feels pretty heavy even without the extra weights
1820	pos	Accurate movements and great feel make this probably the best mouse I have used
1821	neg	Pain in the rear mouse
1821	neg	Keeps refusing to recognize long presses
1821	neg	Cant drag anything around my screen anymore
1821	neg	Logitech like other brands seem to be going downhill in design
1821	neg	Was such a huge fan of this company
1822	pos	This mouse is amazing, it is very comfortable to hold and the response is fantastic
1822	pos	I love the quick Change of resolution and the feedback from the buttons
1823	pos	Very comfortable mouse
1823	pos	Easy to configure
1823	pos	The weight customization is really nice as well
1823	pos	Loving this mouse
1824	neg	mouse wheel did not last a month
1824	neg	its broken
1824	neg	the buttons are fine but for some reason wont stay programmed
1824	neg	a waste of my money
1825	pos	Precise, does have a good click tones on the main and side buttons
1826	pos	Great mouse works and functions well
1827	pos	Good feeling mouse all around, but the main problem my head with this gaming mouse was it‚Äôs free scrolling scroll wheel
1827	pos	There are many times that I would play a game and use the scroll wheel to swap between weapons and find myself using a different weapon when I intentionally scroll to because of the scroll wheel being free locking
1828	pos	I recommend it
1829	pos	The one complaint I have is that based on placement of the dpi shifters, if you don't have a whole lot of room, you'll bash it and change your dpi
1829	pos	This can be changed in GHub though, so it's not too big a deal
1830	neg	This is a great mouse
1830	neg	That feels and performs amazing and the weight can adjusted to your preference
1830	neg	However, the left mouse button started double clicking randomly regardless of the computer it was used on
1830	neg	This is a known issue with logitech mice
1830	neg	If it wasn't for that this would be a perfect mouse
1831	pos	Bought to replace Logitech mouse with broken scroll wheel
1831	pos	Mouse feels on the small side
1831	pos	Even with all the included weights, the mouse tilts forward when left clicking
1832	pos	The actual performance of the mouse is great, but the location of the buttons for raising/lowering sensitivity is RIGHT next to the left click
1832	pos	This has resulted in unexpected sensitivity changes in the middle of games which is infuriating
1833	pos	I long for the day plastic is no longer used
1833	pos	Plastic is shitty does not matter because the material is cheap and ugly
1833	pos	the side buttons are annoying at times
1833	pos	over all gaming experience has been great
1834	pos	Great deal for what I paid for it
1834	pos	Lots of options and all buttons have a good feel to them
1835	pos	I love this mouse
1835	pos	All the buttons work fine, and the smooth scroll wheel glides for a really long time
1835	pos	Its very comfortable
1835	pos	If you like light gaming mice, this is a bit heavy even with no weights
1836	pos	I purchased this mouse for about $40-$50 dollars, and it was a great upgrade from my previous Red Dragon mouse
1836	pos	I enjoy being able to map the buttons for production
1837	neg	ive had it like 2 weeks it constantly disconnects when plugged in, i just had to plug it in 5 times for it to finally connect its absolutely awful already deteriorated enough to where it barely works and i havent even taken it off the desk
1838	pos	Good mouse
1838	pos	Has buttons
1838	pos	I click them
1838	pos	Has some minor customization with some plastic pieces
1839	pos	Cumple todo lo deseado
1840	neg	At first, I liked it, it was nice and sturdy, it looked good and felt good
1840	neg	But after a while of using it, I noticed that it kept hiccuping, like the cursor on the screen would stop while I was moving the mouse, this proved very difficult to deal with since it refused to move at one point while I was playing a game
1840	neg	A waste of 50 bucks
1841	pos	Bought it for fps gaming and so far loving it, the added features such as the dpi button, scroll lock and the ability to balance weight according to your will is quite impressive
1842	pos	I ordered it on accident
1843	pos	Feels great in your hand and is customizable with the weights
1843	pos	The number of buttons to program works out really well for me playing everything from EFT and Cod to WoW and New World
1844	pos	It‚Äôs fken perfect
1844	pos	Although the software is a bit tricky for an untrained eye
1844	pos	I highly recommend this product for any gamer to have
1844	pos	I Originally wanted the wireless version but it‚Äôs overpriced so I‚Äôll just settle for this one
1845	pos	Great mouse
1846	neg	Disappointed that the left click of the mouse stopped working properly after a year's use
1847	pos	This product is really bad
1847	pos	It's hard to hold with my massive hands and the set up is anoyingly hard to do
1847	pos	The only good thing about this product is it's rgb can be customized slightly
1848	pos	a nice mouse
1849	pos	I mean it
1849	pos	11 buttons which are configurable
1849	pos	Check
1849	pos	Extremely comfortable
1849	pos	Check
1849	pos	Ridiculously responsive
1849	pos	Absolutely
1849	pos	RGB
1849	pos	Yup
1849	pos	Epic scroll wheel
1849	pos	Yuppers
1849	pos	DPI shifter
1849	pos	Yup
1849	pos	Trust me and get this mouse
1849	pos	You won't regret it in the slightest
1850	pos	Take one star off because it is too sensitive
1851	pos	Works well
1851	pos	If you want to configure the buttons you need to download Logitech Gaming Software to your computer
1851	pos	You can assigned timed macros and single key presses to any button
1851	pos	There is a middle button which is automatically set to change the mouse‚Äôs configuration ‚Äúprofile‚Äù
1851	pos	This makes it easy to change your configuration from one game to the other with only a single press
1851	pos	I highly recommend this mouse
1852	pos	It good for its price
1852	pos	After a month, I started to hear the scroll wheel squeak a tad bit
1853	pos	Feels sturdy great tracking macros are easy to setup clicks feel good
1854	pos	Is a good mouse, very ergonomic, and I like the customization tools with it, but the main issue is Drag & Drop
1854	pos	It doesn't make sense that I had to revert to an Amazon basics mouse, because I can't drag and drop with the Logitech G502 Hero
1854	pos	Very frustrating
1855	pos	Amazing mouse
1855	pos	Bought to connect to a gaming laptop and it works great
1855	pos	No lag
1855	pos	Very smooth
1856	neg	it's a pain
1857	pos	I got it to help with my wrist issues and it definitely did
1858	pos	Great for gaming, DPI buttons too close to left click, but you get used to it
1858	pos	Very durable, I've RAGED and slammed this thing and it's lasted
1859	pos	Very good quality and comfort
1859	pos	Great for gaming
1860	pos	X-mas gift for young grandson
1860	pos	He is a gamer and says it is easy to handle
1861	pos	People who like flatter wider mice to rest their hand on should look elsewhere
1862	neg	Just less than a month with using it not that much and suddenly the middle wheel button is not clicking anymore and it's broken
1863	pos	Incre√≠ble mouse, estoy muy contento con el
1863	pos	Los m√∫ltiples botones funcionan perfectamente
1863	pos	La posibilidad de hacer scroll infinito es muy √∫til
1863	pos	Lo √∫nico que me molesta solo un poco es la posici√≥n del bot√≥n sniper que es solo un poco dif√≠cil de alcanzar
1863	pos	Del resto est√° perfecto
1864	pos	This mouse really is great
1864	pos	I use it for engineering design, for the programmable buttons
1864	pos	Logitech really put the buttons in the right spots
1864	pos	The design is solid and feels durable
1864	pos	I have all of the auxiliary weights in it and I really like the feel of that
1864	pos	I love it
1865	pos	Good product but the money paid for it is a bit expensive
1865	pos	We needed it so purchased it, but wont buy it again, only because of the price
1865	pos	The value is decent
1866	neg	The "customizeable features" are horrible
1866	neg	You can't customize all the buttons, only like 3 of them, and when you do change the features they keep resetting and you have to go through the whole process of customizing everying again
1867	pos	No more recharging and having it go dead in the middle of a raid
1868	pos	for $50, has all I want
1869	pos	I like the weights to customize the "feel" when using the mouse
1869	pos	Buttons are easy to program and intuitively designed
1870	pos	I used the legendary Logitech MX518 since 2010
1870	pos	Made the leap and it was worth it
1870	pos	It took me two weeks to get confident with it, so if you buy it and wonder if you regret switching, just give it some more time
1871	pos	Can't map all the buttons for some reason but other then that it's really good the scrolling is the best vary smooth üëå
1872	pos	This mouse is perfect for gaming
1872	pos	Fits my hand really well
1872	pos	Accurate and responsive
1872	pos	Really like the weights that come with it
1872	pos	allows you to adjust the feel of the mouse
1872	pos	Would buy again
1873	pos	How I have missed you
1873	pos	And to have you upgraded now
1873	pos	I'm having a handful of mousey pleasure right now
1873	pos	In fact, I liked it so well I got it for work too
1874	pos	Good deal
1875	pos	Bought it for my son, who had the Razer DeathAddr before it
1875	pos	He is very happy with it
1875	pos	He claim that it is more comfortable for FPS games then the Razer
1875	pos	The app is also more intuitive and easy to use
1876	pos	Excellent mouse overall
1876	pos	Love the way it feels & you can tell right out of the box that it's quality all around
1876	pos	May get another sometime down the road for my laptop
1877	pos	overall a good mouse have had it for about 3 months and the only problems that i have are that for my claw grip it is not the best and the bottom is alrady starting to ware
1877	pos	on all other counts one of the best mice that i have ever used
1878	pos	Overall good mouse and the logitech ghub software makes it easy to program any of the programmable buttons
1878	pos	My only issue is the scroll wheel feels a bit too loose
1878	pos	Its not as tactile as i would have liked
1878	pos	Maybe thats because of its second free spinning mode
1879	pos	Hi, you just started reading reviews for the Logitech G502 Hero mouse
1879	pos	Stop scrolling down, and click add to cart
1880	neg	AVOID
1881	pos	Everything arrived as expected, pretty good mouse, my second G502
1882	pos	Have you ever felt the need to go through all of your weapons 6 times over in under 1 second
1882	pos	How about only spamming overhead or thrust attacks without having to keep your finger on the mouse wheel
1882	pos	Well now you can
1882	pos	And if you don't want to use the Chad Scroll Wheel feature, you can just lock it in place
1883	pos	This Mouse Is The Best Selling Gaming Mouse In The World, Amazing
1884	pos	I love the feel and motion of this mouse , glides through your mat like butter , Weights were something i didint know i needed till i tried them
1884	pos	:p overall so happy with this mouse i just had to write a review
1884	pos	hehe
1885	pos	It is only needs to be wired when charging
1886	pos	Best mouse that i ever had
1886	pos	Maybe to many buttons for me personally
1886	pos	Other than that, sensational mouse
1887	neg	Only been using it for a few months and right click is messing up
1887	neg	The scroll is super heavy and loud
1888	neg	Have used Logitech products for years
1888	neg	This mouse was fine until the left button started freaking out
1888	neg	Warranty process has been ridiculous so far
1888	neg	Still waiting for a response after jumping through several hoops to prove the issue and that I actually purchased it
1889	pos	Great feel and comfort to use
1889	pos	I love the added weights to customize the mouse
1889	pos	Really helps when aiming and precision movements
1889	pos	Totally recommend this product
1890	pos	As a college student who just built their first PC, I went to see the recommended products for my tower and peripherals
1890	pos	The G502 was one and I don‚Äôt regret it
1890	pos	Having multiple mouse buttons plus the G-Hub driver/application helps in fine tuning DPI to you needs, wether it be gaming or productivity
1891	pos	Perfect
1892	pos	As of today I got this mouse but as I checked the ratings I have read that their was a chance for your mouse being used which is true
1892	pos	The mouse wasn't scratched or anything like that it looked fairly new but when I checked the weights I saw fingerprints, scratches and steins
1892	pos	If the mouse was in the same shape as the weights I would give the rating a 1 star and other than that it is just as what 5 star raters say
1893	pos	good value
1894	pos	Very solid mouse
1894	pos	It feels like it would last a lifetime, and it's very comfortable to use as well
1894	pos	I'm not a huge fan of the mouse wheel, but it doesn't detract from the over quality of the mouse
1895	pos	This item was gifted
1895	pos	I believe the recipient is very pleased
1896	neg	I was planning to buy a new one, but I received a used oneThe condition was bad
1896	neg	1
1896	neg	There is no weight2
1896	neg	The scroll is too heavy3
1896	neg	There was hair on the backAfter all, I put it in the garbage without using it
1896	neg	I'm sorry just because the fit was good
1897	pos	G502 best for fever
1898	pos	Its a gamererers moused
1899	pos	Simply the best
1899	pos	The most comfortable and highest precision mouse
1899	pos	I had proteus core and I still think the hero is  better
1900	pos	like it but the light is weak
1900	pos	very good quality and decent price
1901	neg	This is my third G502, same problem
1901	neg	The right click mouse button starts to double click or not activate at all after a while
1902	pos	I went back to my G602, it seems like a smaller mouse
1902	pos	good mouse but smaller than expected
1903	pos	nice feel to it
1904	pos	This mouse is great
1904	pos	Fully programmable buttons and it fits in my hand perfect
1904	pos	All the buttons are in ideal locations for quick use
1905	pos	This mouse does the job for gaming, and general use‚Äîit certainly is a step up from generic mice
1905	pos	The only issue I personally have is the fact the DPI mode toggle switch on the side is very sensitive, and the way my hand rests on the mouse ends up toggling it a lot
1905	pos	Otherwise, this has been a great purchase
1906	pos	Priced right for a casual/pseudo competitive gamer
1906	pos	This is the peripheral for you
1907	pos	I son love his mouse, great gaming product
1908	pos	Great mouse so far
1908	pos	Moves the cursed very quickly
1908	pos	Much faster then my old mouse
1909	pos	really good mouse so far so good
1909	pos	only problem is i this thing is pretty open somewhat of a neat freak and it's hard to clean
1910	pos	Excellent mouse
1910	pos	Between this mouse, the g pro hero and the mx518 I can easily say the G502 Hero is my favorite mouse hands down
1910	pos	The only thing I would change is the scroll wheel is a little slippery when using the step mode
1911	pos	Honestly been in love with the G502 for a good while now with the adjustable movement and scrolling speeds along with the multiple buttons on the mouse itself
1911	pos	If you're a gamer this is definitely a mouse for you
1912	pos	Nice
1913	pos	The quality of this mouse is amazing it has amazing censors
1913	pos	The only downside is if you were planing on playing a game which relies heavily on the mouse scroll wheel which is very well made but may need some getting used to
1914	pos	Lo compre para jugar videos juegos
1914	pos	Excelente calidad
1915	neg	The friction less pad peeled up and this happen when i got it
1916	pos	I dont know what to say really, I dont have a lot of experience with mice
1916	pos	This is everything I could have imagined and more
1917	pos	Its a great mouse, but the new software doesn't always work right (atleast it did before I switched) but switching to the old one was easy and it works great, won't be changing it any time soon
1918	pos	You can't go wrong with this mouse, I am very impressed and pleased with the quality and features
1919	pos	Love this mouse
1919	pos	Fits my hand perfectly, and adjustable weight is very nice
1919	pos	Software with macros and lights is great
1920	pos	Like everything except the wire gets in the way
1921	pos	Mouse is kinda heavy but it fits my hand perfectly
1921	pos	(palm grip)
1921	pos	Thing is sensor running perfectly
1921	pos	At my first try my clicking acc increased %10 but tracking is kinda harder
1921	pos	(probably switching from lighter mouse)
1922	pos	good
1923	pos	This mouse has it all
1923	pos	Infinite scroll wheel, on the fly dpi switching, 5 programable buttons, removable weights, ergonomic design, rubberized texture, and the logo is rgb not to mention the Logitech G Hub software is awesome
1923	pos	I wouldn't buy any other mouse if I would have known how good this mouse is
1924	pos	I didn't want a wired mouse but I could live with it the inconvenience when the wireless version costs a lot more
1925	pos	I personally have a some problems with this mouse because of my very large hands
1925	pos	For most people I would rate as a five star but for me I can only a muster a 4 star
1926	pos	Nice mouse
1926	pos	It looked great
1927	pos	My son uses it mainly for gaming
1928	neg	In less than a year the left click button stopped working correctly and now does not hold the click
1928	neg	I'm dissapointed
1929	pos	Love the way this mouse feels
1929	pos	Only complaint is the Logitech app itself it‚Äôs hard to customize or change
1929	pos	But other then that the mouse itself is amazing
1930	pos	üëç
1931	pos	This mouse is a good buy for the $50 or so
1931	pos	The mouse itself has a lot of programmable buttons but my favorite part is the way that it gives a comfortable and controlled grip
1931	pos	FYI this mouse is on the heavier end even without the weights
1931	pos	This is ok just depends on your opinion for high dps or low dps
1931	pos	Good mouse I like it :)
1932	pos	any type of high end mouse user will appreciate this
1932	pos	good ergonomics
1932	pos	feels comfy
1932	pos	solid construction
1932	pos	good scrolling
1933	pos	Love the weight, it's mostly ergonomic, but some of the extra buttons are little obscure
1934	neg	I just got the mouse, played with it for a few days and I've noticed that the mouse will spinout when playing shooters
1934	neg	Not very happy with it for that
1934	neg	The ergonomics are nice however, I wish there was a sort of grip for the pinky to rest on
1935	pos	This is the 3rd one I've bought
1935	pos	They're all wonderful
1935	pos	The software is decent, but the actual quality of the mouse is flawless
1935	pos	I cant see myself switching away from this anytime soon
1936	neg	Only had it for about a year, and now my left click is randomly double clicking when I only want a single click
1936	neg	There is a connection issue between the plate and the sensor
1937	pos	Was a pretty useful mouse for 10 months, then it developed a problem of registering a double click when I only click once or not registering me holding down the mouse button because its registered a double click
1937	pos	Makes fps a little more annoying for both automatic and single shot guns
1938	neg	g hub wont see this mouse,  only fix that works is starting in ADMIN mode
1938	neg	what the hell Logitech
1939	pos	all good
1940	pos	It fits nicely in my hand, love all the additional buttons, works awesome for my gaming and programming needs
1941	pos	Best mouse
1942	pos	My kids have used several gaming devices like this one
1942	pos	As of right now, this mouse appears to be their favorite
1943	pos	Worked like a charm until it started acting up
1943	pos	When dragging a selection it would unselect part way through and start a new selection
1943	pos	Took me a while to figure out it was a hardware mouse issue
1943	pos	Now it's unavailable to return
1943	pos	First issue I've had with a logitech product
1943	pos	Might be a fluke
1943	pos	Maddening
1944	neg	Scrolling wheel not working
1944	neg	It‚Äôs keep rotating for no reason
1944	neg	Logitech g hub don‚Äôt find this mouse for no reason
1944	neg	Total disappointment:(
1945	pos	I like the mouse, however when ever I try to move an item by drag and drop, I end up pushing the button located by the thumb
1945	pos	I have tried different grips, but always with the same effect
1946	pos	It is a really nice mouse for it's price
1947	pos	great mouse little expensive but worth it in my opinion
1948	pos	Works as expected
1949	neg	I have had to send this mouse back twice both times after the first couple uses the scroll wheel just falls apart cant move it without having the scroll wheel go flying
1950	pos	Excellent mouse, has all the right buttons and placements and excellent software to back it up
1950	pos	Also must add that I had an issue with the right click button not responding accurately to clicks
1950	pos	The company stood behind their product and shipped me out a new mouse without hassle
1950	pos	Would recommend this mouse 100%
1951	pos	Got this as part of my nephews Christmas
1951	pos	He loved it
1951	pos	Definitely loves to game so I scored points with this purchase
1952	neg	The mouse is completely missing one of the teflon feet, meaning it does not slide smoothly on a mouse pad
1952	neg	It is also missing the weights that were supposed to come with it
1952	neg	I am more than disappointed
1952	neg	I'm furious
1953	pos	Love it
1953	pos	Works great
1954	neg	almost have had it for 2 years, right click is occasionally functional most of the time it registers many clicks
1954	neg	so like, who needs to aim in a FPS
1954	neg	past that it's been pretty nice
1955	pos	Lo mejor para jugar
1956	neg	It's a piece of garbage
1956	neg	I ordered this in april 2020 and come 2021 now when i hold the right mouse button down it keeps clicking instead of holding
1956	neg	So basically don't expect it to last if you're buying this because you are tired of going through cheap mice
1957	pos	My favorite mouse Bought a razer hate it Went G50 to happy
1958	pos	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson who is a computer wiz

1959	pos	I find the G502 very comfortable to hold and use
1959	pos	I love the way it looks
1959	pos	There are a lot of buttons for someone used to one at their thumb but I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

1960	pos	Been a Razer guy most of my PC gaming life
1960	pos	Move to the LG mouse
1960	pos	Feels great in the hand

1961	pos	15/15‚Åµ

1968	pos	I had no idea a mouse could do so much
1969	pos	Looks great
1969	pos	I'm happy to keep using Logitech, I wish the price was more competitive, but it's all good
1970	neg	Inaccurate overpriced piece of garbage
1971	pos	This is a great mouse
1971	pos	I was having issues with my wired mouse getting interference
1971	pos	I was worried the cord would get in the way, but it does not
1971	pos	This is has a nice weight and feels nice
1972	neg	I loved this mouse, and it would have been my "forever" mouse if the left button hadn't stopped working after 3 months of use
1972	neg	Infuriating
1973	pos	My daughter liked it for her gaming
1974	pos	Excellent corded mouse
1974	pos	Just not large enough for me in terms of vertical height
1975	pos	Love this mouse, sleek and easy, did not need any additional weights
1975	pos	G sync adds some additional immersion that was unexpected
1976	neg	Trash
1977	pos	It is comfortable, responsive, and just all around a great mouse
1977	pos	I have ZERO cons for this mouse
1978	neg	Scroll wheel only registering 1/0 of the scrolls after a month of use
1978	neg	Pretty disappointing
1979	pos	I think it's a good mouse just too heavy for me
1980	pos	Works well
1980	pos	Has a design that takes getting use to
1980	pos	I had a double click problem only 2 months of having it but I  fixed it
1981	neg	I've had the same mouse since forever but these latest ones are built like hot garbage
1981	neg	The components don't last, the software is iffy at best, and it regularly breaks and double clicks
1982	pos	This mouse feels so smooth and comfortable
1982	pos	Very responsive and can be easily adjusted
1982	pos	Plus you can adjust it's weight with inserts that go in the bottom of the mouse for a personalized feel
1983	pos	Good for gaming
1984	pos	I enjoy the feel and weight of this mouse
1985	pos	Bought this mouse about a week ago, the standard weight feels really comfortable to me but I really like how I can add or subtract weight
1985	pos	Having the 11 keys on the mouse is a bit much for me but I use about 3-5 of them depending on the game I am playing
1985	pos	Really happy with my purchase and will definitely look to this brand for future upgrades
1986	neg	Program the buttons and it intermittently works as programed

1992	pos	Love the Ergos and the weight
1992	pos	The controls are easy to access and the extra weights are a nice touch
1993	neg	Far less durable than the previous g502, mouse wheel has failed on 2 of the 3 of these I have purchased, and the other has a bad sensor which randomly moves the mouse
1993	neg	Would not recommend
1994	pos	bought this for my brother as a gift
1994	pos	it‚Äôs a great mouse with awesome tracking
1994	pos	only downside is the bottom of it where the stickers are, are peeling off

1997	pos	I won't continue to use it to find out how long it will really last as I have a spare already
1998	pos	Thoroughly enjoy this product
1998	pos	I just want to say don‚Äôt think your mouse wheel is broken when you get it
1998	pos	There is a button on the mouse that stops it from forever spinning and it is located right under the scroll wheel
1998	pos	This threw me for a loop lol
1999	neg	The software interacts very strangely with my pc and games
1999	neg	It randomly switch dpi while playing
1999	neg	The buttons are clunky and weirdly placed
1999	neg	I regret buying

2009	pos	Another feature is build quality; it‚Äôs outlasting the razer mice I‚Äôve had before

2020	pos	It bothers me since it is new, shouldn't have issues so soon
2021	pos	Excellent material for a good price
2022	pos	Works great as intended
2023	neg	Not sure if it‚Äôs genuine or not but no excuse for the glider pad to be nowhere near where it‚Äôs supposed to be fresh out of a sealed box
2024	pos	The combination of buttons on the mouse makes it the superior gaming mouse for mmorpg
2024	pos	I won‚Äôt buy another mouse until the new version comes out
2025	pos	I use this mouse primarily for normal computer use and some gaming (World of Warcraft)
2025	pos	It works perfectly and it fits very nice in my hand
2025	pos	The DPI is fully adjustable and I have tuned it to my personal preference so that it's not too sensitive or too dull for the expected movement that I need
2026	pos	Great mouse
2026	pos	Amazon sent me a used/open box mouse with hair in the section for the weights
2026	pos	Returned and picked up from Best Buy
2026	pos	Still a great mouse
2027	pos	I'm very picky with mice size and weight, and I've been pleasantly surprised with this one
2027	pos	It also has a couple extra buttons near the left-click button, which is awesome
2028	pos	I‚Äôve had this Mouse For over 2 months and honestly it‚Äôs worth it kinda heavy if you use the weights but light if you don‚Äôt good mouse for fortnite in my opinionüíØ
2029	pos	The flexibility with the programmable buttons is very nice
2030	pos	Very sturdy and super customizable mouse
2030	pos	Feels great in the hand and I don't cramp up after long gaming sessions

2031	pos	1 Surround Sound Gaming Headset, Perfect match
2032	pos	Best mouse for me
2032	pos	I use it for development daily
2032	pos	When you are going through long files of code the infinite scroll is amazing
2032	pos	Have one for at the office and at home
2033	neg	Double click on right mouse button, and no feedback click on release of left mouse button in less than a year
2033	neg	This is a low quality copy of the proteus model that gave me 3 years of use before needing to be replaced
2033	neg	Skip this and get the proteus instead
2034	pos	I loved this mouse VERY MUCH
2034	pos	, it is super comfortable and it looks super high quality
2035	pos	Not much to say, It is a really good Gaming Mouse
2036	pos	good mouse but too small if you have big hands
2037	pos	Love the weight and how sensitive the mouse buttons are, makes for easiness in FPS games
2037	pos	Wish there were more usable buttons though and not so many that affect your DPI
2037	pos	Overall, great mouse
2038	pos	Bought this as a replacement for my g700s
2038	pos	It feels great in my hand but not as great as the g700s which felt perfect
2038	pos	The buttons feel great and I'm happy with this mouse
2039	pos	Boyfriend loved it
2039	pos	Said it was very smooth and loved all the programmable buttons
2040	pos	I've had great luck with Logitech mice
2040	pos	This one fits my hand well and works flawlessly so far
2041	pos	Super easy to use, feels comfortable
2041	pos	Has enough buttons for my daily use
2042	pos	My 15 year old son loves it
2042	pos	I haven't used it but esthetically it's a cool  mouse
2043	pos	Mouse works great, did what I needed/wanted
2044	neg	This is my second exactly same mouse but this one came broken
2044	neg	I need to press the back key really hard for it to work
2044	neg	Have to return it
2045	pos	Back button on side is too easily, accidentally pressed other wise a great product
2046	neg	Less than 1 year old mouse, left mouse button double clicks all the time
2046	neg	I've tried various tweaks to settings and swapping usb ports and nothing fixes the issue
2046	neg	It's a known faulty switch-BUYER BEWARE
2047	neg	Worked fine for a short while and then died
2047	neg	The ergonomics of this mouse are really weird too
2047	neg	So unless you have small hands and long fingers prepare to be uncomfortable
2047	neg	And the sniping button is way way too far forward to be any use
2048	neg	Extremely heavy and very slick
2048	neg	Only my second mouse I‚Äôve ever bought but I went back to my g403 within about 3 hours of unboxing this mouse
2048	neg	Also sounded like something was rattling every time I moved it
2048	neg	Cheaply made
2049	pos	I hate this mouse wheel almost as much as I hate Jeff
2049	pos	Other than that it‚Äôs nice
2050	neg	When we went to program the dpi button it didn‚Äôt work and tried five times and still didn‚Äôt work
2051	pos	This mouse is so good that i should only mention the negatives
2051	pos	1-) It's a bit smaller than i expected
2051	pos	Pay attention before buying2-) some accidental clicks
2051	pos	3-) The software is a little tricky
2051	pos	in both finding and using it
2051	pos	Other than these minor inconveniences, it's a highly recommended mouse
2051	pos	I love it
2052	pos	Best mouse I have ever owned
2053	pos	It's a good mouse, but if you use index finger on left click and middle finger on right click, your little finger and ring finger tend to fall off with no where to go and feels uncomfortable
2054	pos	Sooo good
2054	pos	Using it for 4 months now
2054	pos	It's a beautiful thing
2055	pos	my favorite mouse I've ever used for gaming
2055	pos	super smooth and responsive, very comfortable, nice cable, great rgb, etc
2055	pos	excellent mouse and great for almost every task I use it for
2056	pos	I absolutely love it
2056	pos	Highly recommend this product inexpensive and it is easy to use and handle it
2057	pos	heavy with all weights added, feels quality
2057	pos	very smooth in game
2057	pos	you can pay more, but you can't really get a better gaming mouse
2057	pos	as long as the ergonomics of this mouse fit you hand, it's a winner
2058	pos	Its amazing performs great and app lets you customize dpi amazingly for certain games I just wish the buttons to change dpi were not as close to left click button
2059	neg	Just be careful with this mouse, as eventually the mouse wheel will quite easily wear down and spin uselessly
2060	pos	I love all the buttons on the mouse it definitely great for fps games
2060	pos	also the setup is super easy
2060	pos	you can customize the lighting and button functionality with the Logitech app
2061	neg	Mouse is great in your hand
2061	neg	The click sounds are good
2061	neg	Everything can be tailored with the Logitech app
2061	neg	Except the Primary click stopped working after 6 months
2061	neg	I wrote to the support team 2 weeks ago and have yet to hear back from them
2061	neg	If you're willing to buy a mouse every six months this mouse is for you
2061	neg	:/
2062	neg	About 2 1/2 months the left click started to not register, month later and now the right is doing the same while getting worse
2062	neg	I've used a older version of this same mouse and can confidently say the quality has gone down over the years
2063	neg	I bought this mouse and a keyboard, the keyboard and the amazon box in which both products came was perfect, the only thing that was broken is the mouse, so i think they gave me an used mouse
2064	pos	I love this it may be a little overpriced but if you love gaming get this
2065	pos	Bought for my grandson and he loves it
2066	neg	Stop working after 2 and a half months
2066	neg	Cool mouse bad materials
2066	neg	Broken right click
2067	pos	Really comfortable, and customizable would really recommend
2068	pos	So far it has been a good mouse for their needs
2069	neg	Well, it worked great for about 6 months
2069	neg	Now the left button is mostly double clicking
2069	neg	Very aggravating
2070	pos	Gift for my son
2071	pos	This is my second logitech mouse and the first one last for 3yrs and it is heavily use you will never get any other mouse once you use it
2072	neg	My previous mouse was a proteus 502 which lasted 3 years under heavy use
2072	neg	The hero has started ghost clicking less than a year after purchase under light use
2073	neg	MOUSE WHEEL BROKE
2074	pos	Its to small for my hand really but i manage just fine
2075	neg	This is the second of these I bought, after the first one died on me
2075	neg	It didn't last 7 months
2075	neg	The right mouse button just won't register that it's being held down

2080	pos	My teenager loves it
2081	neg	Still disconnected for no reason, and after a while, he can fight the hennans again
2082	pos	Easy to customize
2083	neg	Almost after a month of buying the mouse and only a few hours of gaming use per day, the bout feet(bottom side) starts peeling which very annoying and messes up how the mouse functions
2083	neg	Do not recommend buying for gaming and for daily use
2084	pos	This mouse is great for gaming
2084	pos	It's very customizable and has a great feel in your hand
2084	pos	It looks sleek and even has adjustable weight

2085	pos	It's easy to use and perfect for gaming
2085	pos	I would recommend this to anyone
2085	pos	(:
2086	pos	Online product claims it has a 25k DPI sensor but when it arrived it clearly says 16k
2086	pos	Overall decent mouse for $40
2086	pos	Wish the mouse clicks were quieter
2087	neg	The most was ok for the first 5-6 weeks but less than 2 months of use the wheel stopped working completely
2088	pos	Got this for my son for Christmas he loved it
2089	pos	Thumb position is a bit cramped but that is to be expected as there are buttons there that are supposed to be easy to press
2089	pos	All in all it a quality mouse with very nice feel
2090	pos	I like it is kind of heavy even without the weights on it but it‚Äôs cool good sensor good wire
2091	pos	Bought this mouse in December 2018, just last night the right click stopped working
2091	pos	Here I am buying it again
2091	pos	Absolutely fantastic mouse 10/10 would buy a 3rd time too
2092	pos	Great mouse, took me a few days to realize I could lock and unlock the scroll wheel so it wasnt spinning like crazy but aside from that it is a good mouse for casual gaming
2093	pos	Solid mouse with solid software
2093	pos	I love the 3 profiles you can switch between and the ability to switch dpi speeds during a game
2093	pos	Rgb is pretty minimal but I love the mouse
2094	pos	Awesome
2095	pos	Super comfortable, a little heavy but it glides really well on my mousepad so i dont notice it
2095	pos	Looks really nice too
2096	pos	Very ergonomic, good material, and good for gaming, Some times it doesn't work but in 99% sure that it's just my mouse
2097	pos	This mouse is everything i was looking for but the only downside thats not even noticeable is the 3rd light went out seconds after i plugged it in and used it but overall the weights are good and the sniper button is useful
2098	pos	Muy practico
2099	pos	Great mouse
2099	pos	With keybinds, my gaming experience has improved and I am happy with this purchase
2100	pos	The mouse works great
2100	pos	Personally I like a little heavier mouse so being able to customize its weight is a great feature
2101	pos	Before i got this i had been in desperate need for a better mouse and all i can say is i love it
2101	pos	Worth the buy
2102	pos	Great for gaming and comfortable
2103	pos	The best Gaming Mouse ever
2104	pos	Cool

2106	pos	Love the feel
2106	pos	I have small hands and this fits very well
2106	pos	Love how I can control the weight
2107	pos	Good
2108	pos	The Scroll wheel broke in less than a week, I do use the mouse every day for hours, but a week of lifespam is ridiculous
2109	pos	Everything works fine for me
2109	pos	I was a bit worried since many of the reviews complained about buttons not working, but I haven't experienced any issues so far
2109	pos	Definitely worth the price
2110	pos	No me agrado que en el t√≠tulo dijera como nuevo, lleg√≥ sin caja, el alambre de conexi√≥n un poco maltratado, sin sus pesas y pues el precio fue de casi 60 d√≥lares me esperaba algo un poco m√°s
2111	pos	Huge step up from my old mouse
2111	pos	Good weight and has a nice smooth "grippy" feel
2111	pos	Only wish it had a few more buttons but I'm definitely happy with it
2112	pos	Feels great, works consistently, and the configuration software is actually functional
2112	pos	Would recommend this over RedDragon or Corsair mice any day
2113	pos	Me llego todo bien pero no tengo fotos xd
2114	pos	The product is very good, it arrives in perfect condition, at the beginning it takes a little getting used to (I used a smaller mouse), in general very good product
2115	pos	Was great, until left button just stopped working outta nowhere after a couple months
2116	pos	Amazing featureset, great options customizable from Logitech G Hub or the older Logitech Gaming Software
2116	pos	Only issues I've heard is on the software side, hopefully Logitech can work that out
2117	pos	This is a great product, but I recommend getting the wireless for people who uses a laptop
2117	pos	The wire is a bit of a drag, but overall still works the same way
2118	pos	For some people who‚Äôs week or spent a long time on gaming this mouse is very heavy
2118	pos	But it have perfect griping sense and smooth on mouse pad, so it‚Äôs a great mouse
2119	pos	I bought it for the purpose of gaming and it is perfect
2119	pos	All the buttons are mappable to suit your gaming needs
2120	pos	Logitech G502 - This mouse is one of the apex best out there
2120	pos	The looks, feel, and sensitivity of it are unmatched
2120	pos	The ability to reduce or increase the weight to what works for your personal choice is outstanding
2120	pos	100% satisfied
2121	pos	Love it
2121	pos	Would highly recommend to those for gaming 100%
2122	pos	This is exactly what I was looking for and fits my hand and grip perfectly
2122	pos	Would strongly recommend to anyone who is looking into a new gaming mouse
2123	pos	For gaming and internet
2124	pos	As a lot of other people says, this is a great buy
2125	pos	It works very well in every aspect
2125	pos	My only complaint is that the dpi presets on xbox are a little slow
2126	pos	Good mouse
2126	pos	Quite unusual form, uncomfortable from the beginning
2126	pos	But after one week of the usage everything is fine
2127	pos	I love the G502 I've had three so far the first died due to it being dropped during a move the second had a bad left switch that would multiple click
2127	pos	Now I have this one and it works great for price
2128	neg	ive had this mouse for a little over a month and the right click started to double click AFTER A MONTH
2129	pos	pressed the infinite scroll button and let her rip, hasn't stopped scrolling for over 2 hours
2130	neg	Some clicks get doubled and it often messes up click and drag
2131	pos	I use this primarily to play FPS and it works great
2131	pos	It is very comfortable and the buttons are convenient
2131	pos	My picture is after two weeks of use
2132	pos	Very nice
2133	pos	Get it
2134	neg	Several people have this same problem, but the mouse only lasts <1 year before the click feature breaks and behind frequently double clicking without even letting go of the button
2135	neg	Did not last long have to return got it For Christmas for my grandson I haven‚Äôt had time to refund if I have one but thumbs down üëé
2136	pos	Feels comfortable in my hand slides easily across the mouse mat
2137	neg	Plugged it in to my pc let it do all of its updates and the stupid thing wouldnt even work
2137	neg	If you going to get this one i suggest just getting the 604 light speed
2137	neg	Much better mouse
2138	pos	This mouse I'd say is the best mouse on the market for the price, nice rgb lighting and up to 16,000 dpi
2138	pos	Mouse is comfy and having 11 programable buttons is a nice luxury
2139	pos	I like that it came with weights, to improve mobility
2139	pos	You can add or remove them easily
2139	pos	Also the design fits most hands my 9 year old can easily use the mouse
2140	pos	just hevy, but the mouse works well
2140	pos	I'd use this mouse in the office not gaming
2141	pos	I'll always be faithful to the g502
2142	pos	Great mouse awesome for gaming easy to use software would buy again
2143	pos	i love this mouse alot the only problom i have is that when i eat something greasy you see the grease on the mouse and its kinda nasty but other then that i love it and it works great
2144	pos	Great value for $50 and has everything you need in a pro gaming mouse
2145	pos	Some buttons are not able to be programmed for everything
2146	neg	Worked great for a little while
2146	neg	Lasted 8 months then began behaving erratically
2146	neg	It cannot click drag at all now and clicks vary between unresponsive and double clicking
2147	pos	Easily recommended
2148	pos	was nice but my right click no longer functions properly after only 1 year
2148	pos	guess i won't go logitech for any mice anymore
2148	pos	my g9x lasted forever (since 2011) and this was the mouse i got after the cord on that finally died
2148	pos	Obviously, build quality has gone way downhill
2149	neg	I really like this mouse but I haven't even had it for a year and I'm having issues with the right button not holding
2149	neg	It very frustrating to play first person shooter games and trying to aim down a scope because it will flicker in and out a few times
2150	pos	Definitely recommend this mouse
2150	pos	So smooth and has a ton of extra binds/buttons
2150	pos	Perfect
2151	pos	Solid mouse
2151	pos	Love that you can add or remove weights
2151	pos	I have big hands so this was a really good fit for me but it‚Äôs also comfy for my wife to use
2151	pos	Mouse wheel also is heavy and does t feel like it will break
2151	pos	Overall good mouse and worth the price
2152	pos	Good mouse but god a mouse should not be this expensive
2153	pos	Very good, move smoothly
2154	pos	If you liked the Alienware TactX mouse with the dual-scroll capability, ergonomics, and DPI buttons, this is the mouse for you
2154	pos	Free-scroll mode is even better
2154	pos	It's an excellent upgrade and excellent mouse
2155	pos	My hands are average size, I wish the whole thing was just a little smaller and had extra buttons on the right hand side as well
2155	pos	It is clearly high quality
2156	pos	As a new pc gamer coming from ps4 specifically for rainbowsix siege, this mouse is awesome
2156	pos	I changed a lot of keybinds to the mouse buttons and it works great
2157	pos	I love it, all the buttons are completely programmable, I've set it up so I can play som games with only my mouse, it's amazing
2158	pos	The best out there with a tight budget
2159	pos	I've had this for a little over a year with no issues
2159	pos	Has the option to change the weight to fit what you like
2160	neg	Less than a year, and my right click is gone to complete shit
2160	neg	Holding it down causes it to be pressed repeatedly, how am I supposed to play Rein or Brigitte
2161	pos	Very great quality mouse
2161	pos	Settings are easy to use
2161	pos	Comfortable in the hand
2161	pos	Light
2161	pos	With added weights
2161	pos	Makes mouse very great for FPS gaming
2162	neg	Unbelievable
2162	neg	Arrived broken and damaged
2162	neg	Not only that but it was LATE too
2162	neg	No time to get another one as it was suppose to be a Christmas gift as well
2162	neg	Truly disappointed
2163	pos	I like this mouse it's heavy so it doesn't move alot great for jitter and butterfly clicking and for gaming
2164	pos	If you want a heavy mouse with great features : look no further
2165	pos	Bought this for my wife, who uses it for gaming
2165	pos	It is small enough that it fits her hand comfortably, but not too small
2165	pos	The Logitech G HUB provides ample customization from changing the color scheme, to customizing your buttons and custom DPI settings
2166	pos	I really like this mouse
2166	pos	Responsive and sleek
2167	pos	Light in weight and easy to use
2168	pos	Comfortable
2168	pos	Neat settings and features
2169	pos	Excellent
2170	pos	Good gaming mouse with lots of different levels of customization of dpi, problem is hand oils stick to it and Logitech‚Äôs program for its devices no longer detects the mouse so I no longer can control what each dpi setting is on the mouse
2171	pos	amazing works and holds up very well
2172	neg	Cool mouse, but only useful for mild gaming
2172	neg	There are only 2 buttons on the side and they only read as 1 and 2 (the numbers above the letters on your keyboard), not as extra mouse buttons
2172	neg	There's also no way to configure how they are read by your computer
2173	pos	Is overall a great mouse
2173	pos	It‚Äôs just that when I use it sometimes the mouse lags a tiny bit when I move the cursor which can be really annoying to deal with
2174	pos	Very impressive
2174	pos	Much better then any other mouse I've bought, would definitely recommend
2174	pos	I've had it for a couple months and is functioning as intended
2174	pos	The extra weights are very helpful as well

2179	pos	Ive been using the mouse for a month now and i enjoy it thoroughly
2179	pos	Great for gaming and just overall use in general
2180	pos	Every mouse I have used before this was crap
2180	pos	I never really wanted to put much into a mouse, but for this price it is well worth it
2180	pos	I put all the weights into the mouse and I love the options
2181	neg	This is my second mouse and they both both defective for the exact same reason
2181	neg	Click and hold is intermittent
2181	neg	Making is useless
2182	pos	I love this mouse
2182	pos	Can't image using anything else at this point
2183	pos	Could be a tad bigger, but i have large hands
2183	pos	5/5 for normal hands
2184	neg	Has problems with double clicking and draging and dropping 3 months in
2184	neg	Constantly double clicks or fails to drag because of bad left mouse button inputs
2185	pos	It‚Äôs a mouse, it works
2185	pos	It hasn‚Äôt broken
2186	neg	Unfortunately the day after the return window closed, this mouse quit working properly

2187	pos	Nice comfortable mouse and fun to use very relaxing great for shooters and mmo

2190	pos	Feels great in the hand, the extra buttons are really nice and the response time on the buttons is excellent
2190	pos	I like my dpi a bit higher (~1100 dpi) and this mouse provides a great feeling of control for that with its extra weight
2191	pos	Bought for my son he seems to like it said it works great
2191	pos	Shipped fast
2192	neg	Scroll wheel breaks for no reason
2192	neg	This is the second one I got
2192	neg	The first one the wheel broke within a week and the second one broke within a couple months
2193	pos	I got this for my grandson; he seemed to like it

2197	neg	When I purchased the mouse, it was marked as being new
2197	neg	When I got the mouse, some things where missing from the packaging, the mouse was very dirty as it seems to have been used already and the box torn up
2198	pos	What does ergonomic mean
2198	pos	I like this mouse
2199	pos	Great mouse
2199	pos	Love all the buttons
2200	pos	The box come in  really bad conditions without protection of amazon like another box or anything
2200	pos	But the mouse didn't suffer any damage
2200	pos	So i'm happy with it
2201	pos	Solid mouse, 403 had smoother wheel but these keys are easier to feel and the multi key repeating is more consistent on this one
2202	pos	I was tired of plugging in my mouse to charge it
2202	pos	This mouse has even more buttons and is just as ergonomic
2203	pos	G402 felt better for grip
2203	pos	This one is 4 stars
2203	pos	The G402 get's 5 stars from me
2203	pos	That should sum it up nicely
2204	pos	It‚Äôs a great mouse if you don‚Äôt like light mouses because you can add weight on it
2205	pos	Replacement mouse loving D3 again
2205	pos	Buttons take a little getting used to but working better than expected
2206	pos	Logitech brought the power yet again

2207	pos	Too-Rated for very good reason
2207	pos	Adjustability is great

2209	pos	Great gaming mouse
2210	pos	comfortable for degenerate binge gaming for extended periods of time & u can add weights to the mouse to become even stronger, physically and mentally
2211	pos	There‚Äôs a lot of buttons to customize and it looks very cool but it was too big for my hand (small size)
2212	pos	El mouse en general fue mucho de mi agrado, muy comodo y se siente muy alta calidad la verdad un mouse clasico que recomiendo mucho si vas a comprar un mouse
2213	pos	I've now bought two of these
2213	pos	My first one began double clicking after several years, but I bought another one because I do like the design
2214	pos	Very solid mouse but the scroll wheel absolutely sucks
2214	pos	Both modes are bad
2215	pos	Love all of the features and it works well
2216	pos	Enjoy it
2217	pos	Good mouse, the app for programming it is not that good, I changed the dpi buttons to other buttons for my games but they would revert back to dpi buttons randomly, I would have to go back in the application and change them again here and there but the mouse itself is really good
2218	pos	Good
2219	pos	The media could not be loaded
2219	pos	El producto se publica como nuevo
2219	pos	Pero c√≥mo ven me lleg√≥ uno re acondicionado

2222	pos	Best mouse in the world this mouse is amazing I bought it to play fortnite because my other mouse laser was worn out and failing this mouse was an amazing alternative although 16k dpi is cool it‚Äôs completely unnecessary I just love this mouse in general
2223	pos	this mouse works good on hard wood or whatever, however it does not work on mouse pads
2224	pos	Very responsive and amazing accuracy
2225	pos	They've come out with different models and I just think this one is their best one
2225	pos	This is the third one of the g502 that I've purchased
2225	pos	Love it
2226	pos	F√°cil de de configurar, un poco grande para mi gusto pero ofrece muy buenos resultados y los botones extras un √©xito total lo uso para dota 2 y apex legend
2227	pos	Great mouse for gaming; I have small hands and it's not too big or heavy (especially because you can adjust the weight by switching out metal pieces inside) for me
2227	pos	Very comfortable, even for long gaming sessions
2228	pos	great mouse, can't really drag click on it but other than that it combines all the good features of my other mice into one
2229	pos	It is a great mouse, the free spinning scroll wheel is a god send
2229	pos	It lasts forever and it fits great in the hand
2230	pos	This is a very good mouse if you want a good mouse for an affordable price
2230	pos	I use it to game Fortnite and i can say that my game improved with this mouse
2231	pos	Very (VERY) happy with this mouse, feels fast and light for gaming
2231	pos	Highly recommend
2232	neg	I  bought this mouse a few months ago and now it won'ts stop disconnecting and reconnecting to my computer
2232	neg	Very annoying
2232	neg	Would like something done to fix this
2233	pos	Its so beautiful thank you
2234	pos	Everything about it is great, excellent, or perfect
2234	pos	I'm astonished, quite frankly
2235	neg	Worked great, really enjoyed it, until 4 months of normal use later, when its cable futzed out, and it would no longer connect to my computer
2235	neg	Best mouse in the world ain't worth jack shit if I can't connect it to my computer
2236	neg	Avoid this mouse
2236	neg	Guaranteed double clicking after around 6 months
2236	neg	I've gone through two of these mice with normal use and the third is probably going to be dead out of the box at this point
2236	neg	I recommend selling the mice if you get a warranty replacement and buying something else
2237	pos	I love everything about this beauty of a mouse
2238	pos	I love this mouse, I had the previous version the g 502 proteus core and it lasted me 8 years
2238	pos	I was sold on logitech after that
2239	pos	The mouse is smooth and easy to use and setup
2239	pos	The integrated memory lets you keep setups across devices easily
2239	pos	The only thing I would like to be improved would be the upload times of the profiles, and the load times of them when plugging in the mouse
2239	pos	Other than that it's perfect
2240	pos	Great for gaming
2240	pos	Has weights 2
2240	pos	5 grams 5 of them
2240	pos	Very precise and the user interface makes customizing very simple
2241	pos	Mouse clicks noticeably lighter/cheaper feeling to me, infinite scroll wheel gummed up in less than one month, the new software is lacking features namely macro function using the on-board profile doesn't work, over all its a good mouse that has fallen victim to updates and newer = better fallacy
2242	neg	Every time I plug it into my PC it decides to stop working or just move on its own, when I use my other mouse it works just fine it‚Äôs not input lag the mouse has been also used before I can see that
2243	pos	I ordered it yesterday and it arrived the next day, and the game feels great in my hands
2243	pos	It also adds iron to add weight to the mouse
2243	pos	I love this mouse
2244	pos	This is the definitive mouse for gaming
2244	pos	super customizeable in terms of DPI, hell even the weight for mouse is customizable
2244	pos	This thing is great out of the box no customization needed but if you do want customize any of it, all the drivers are easy to find and work with
2245	pos	I imported it from the USA to Colombia, the box arrived a little damaged but is normal for this kind of shipping, the product functions perfect and is the best mouse I've ever had, 100% recommended
2246	pos	I've blew threw 9 mice this year and this one seems to be the winner of them all wired or not
2247	pos	Amazing mouse and good software
2247	pos	Not good for people with big hands, the mouse doesn‚Äôt have any arch to it
2248	pos	Nothing
2249	pos	It's good
2250	neg	2021, after a year usage this mouse got serious left click issues
2250	neg	very disappointed that logitech products got such issues
2250	neg	Received in good condition with box
2250	neg	Like the free willy scrolling
2250	neg	Dislike the slightly lower profile of the mouse
2250	neg	Overall a good product, guess I need some time getting use
2251	pos	Nice upgrade from a standard vanilla, non-gaming mouse
2251	pos	My son loved the weights you can add to customize and it has worked great for several months
2251	pos	I'm planning on buying one myself
2252	neg	Bought two on March 5th 2020
2252	neg	One for both my wife and I
2252	neg	Both mice started having problems with the left click button by June 1st same year
2252	neg	I have reached out to Logitech customer service but haven‚Äôt heard back yet
2253	neg	Much smaller than exoected
2254	neg	Don't get this one, the left mouse is faulty on all of them and it will just break eventually
2255	pos	like versatility,cost and response
2256	neg	This mouse is too big to hold in the hand , my hand is a bit difficult to operate
2257	pos	Great dpi, nice quality, and awesome rgb
2257	pos	My mom wants one
2257	pos	:)
2258	pos	Great Product
2259	neg	This mouse was great
2259	neg	Until it wasn't
2259	neg	Now, the LMB is always microclicking, missing clicks, or just in general on the fritz
2260	pos	I'm a software engineer and using this mouse 10 hours a day for the past couple of years
2260	pos	It is perfect
2260	pos	I have 3 of them (office , home, my wife's computer)
2261	pos	I keep hitting button 4 lol fat thumb lol other than that a great mouse
2262	pos	I had the Proteus Core for about eight years and the only reason I replaced it is because I wore it the hell out
2262	pos	This is the same amazing mouse with a few tweaks
2262	pos	I honestly hate the gaming mice with dozens of buttons
2262	pos	This one is absolutely perfect
2263	pos	I love this mouse
2263	pos	It is high quality with nice weight which feels really nice in your hand
2263	pos	It is a bigger style mouse so if you have tiny hands this might not be the mouse for you, but as for me, I have probably above average sized hands and man does this mouse feel great
2264	pos	Awesome mouse for an awesome deal
2264	pos	Very happy with this purchase and I do recommend this mouse to others
2265	pos	i love this mouse but one problem i found is when you add the tuning weights the cover will lose its ability to stay strongly attached so if you also have this problem make sure the weights are all the way in
2266	pos	I think this mouse pad is perfect, it‚Äôs the best size I could find and I love it
2266	pos	It fits nice on my desk and I have so much room with this thing for my mouse
2266	pos	It makes me feel free when I game, I‚Äôd recommend this to anyone who is  looking for a new mouse pad for low dpi gaming
2267	pos	Great mouse for the price
2268	pos	Best mouse I've used in a long time perfect mouse for gaming been the best mouse I've had in a long while so worth it Marcos are so fun to mess with I recommend anyone should buy this mouse
2269	pos	Pretty good
2270	pos	Feels great
2270	pos	Weights make it a good option
2271	pos	The logitech application that can be downloaded on your pc is great
2271	pos	I didn‚Äôt find it heavy, but i didn‚Äôt add any weights
2272	pos	Pretty nice overall
2272	pos	The mouse wheel takes a long time to get used to
2273	neg	Its a bad mouse, i really liked it until mouse button 1 stopped working after 7 months
2273	neg	When i hold mb1 it doesn't work,  it only works to click
2273	neg	I want my money back or a new mouse
2274	pos	Works as expected
2275	pos	Fits hand well
2275	pos	scroll wheel stopped working under 2 weeks of use
2276	pos	works great feels great

2298	pos	Gaming mouse
2298	pos	Great feel
2299	pos	So in love with the way it feels
2300	pos	I bought this vs the Deathadder Elite, and it just doesn't track as well as my Deathadder
2300	pos	However, the weight system in the G502 is unmatched and the customizability of all the buttons was something I wish my other mouse had
2300	pos	Good mouse just not for me
2301	pos	Some buttons like the DPI buttons next to the left mouse button is too big and easy to accidentally click
2301	pos	And its a hassle to program them
2302	pos	Nice fit to my hand and easy to use with the PS5
2303	pos	Arrived quickly and functioned perfectly

2309	pos	It's all functional but I wish it had a manual that explains all the buttons and how they work üòÖ
2310	pos	Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves
2310	pos	Mouse for gaming
2311	pos	After a year, when I have to "drag and drop" between folders and programs, it slips and can't hold onto the items
2311	pos	Hope there is a fix
2312	pos	My hand doesn't hurt as much now
2312	pos	You'll like it
2312	pos	My hand fits around my junk which is about 2 inch's around
2312	pos	so that's the ball park
2313	pos	Mouse feels great, quality seems good for price
2314	pos	This mouse is great for gaming the fell is amazing and the rgb is outstanding
2314	pos	It has a very good glide
2315	pos	Out standing had it for a couple months no complain
2316	pos	Recomendado 100 % no da problemas y da muchas cosas mas que por el precio esta normal no barato y tampoco est√° caro
2317	pos	I recommend this mouse if you are looking for a mouse with more than four buttonsAll ten buttons are programmableIt is not the lightest mouse from LG but you can use it with a high speed mouse pad to make it feel light as a featherVERY FUN
2318	pos	My friend loves the mouse and it works well
2318	pos	However, the state of the box looks as if someone played football with it
2319	pos	This mouse is a 10/10 works perfectly and if you get the software for it you can customize your dpi and color of the mouse
2320	pos	Title
2321	pos	I use this mouse for Fortnight gaming
2321	pos	I like most it precision,  the ability to define each button

2329	pos	The tape/grip is very nice compared to my other mice
2330	pos	AMy grandson loved it

2334	pos	I would recommend this mouse to anyone looking to upgrade to a gaming mouse

2335	pos	coollll

2336	pos	Button layout and the overall size are great for smaller hands
2337	pos	use it, very good

2338	pos	Perfect
2339	pos	Great mouse, OMG great mouse
2339	pos	great price it trashes the 20 dollar/no support/m8 and says goodbye forever
2340	pos	HAve not had any issues
2340	pos	However The GHUB softwear is combative with some games Anti cheat
2341	pos	Too many buttons that change dpi or have dpi setting
2341	pos	Nice wheel that had an option to keep spinning instead of stop
2342	pos	by far the best mouse I have had
2342	pos	feels great and the options are amazing
2343	pos	Upgrade from my older one, still amazing
2344	pos	My only issue is my thumb hits the side buttons
2344	pos	Otherwise it‚Äôs a good mouse
2345	pos	5 stars for the mouse- 1 star for Logitech‚Äôs software not working correctly

2355	pos	The buttons still work, but to make it function again, I have to unplug it and plug it back in
2355	pos	Overall, I can't saw I'm overly happy about it, but when it was working it was decent
2356	pos	Very sleek really fits my hand
2357	pos	One of the best mouses I used I owned about 4 different mice in the last year and since I bought this one I‚Äôm never switching again or buying another unless it breaks than I‚Äôll reorder this one
2358	pos	Tal cual se describe  mi hijo fasinado excelente  su funcion
2359	pos	My son is using it for gaming and has no problems
2359	pos	Everything seems to be working as it‚Äôs supposed to
2360	pos	Really good quality, comfortable shape, scroll wheel is awesome, button customization is great for both gaming and desktop use
2361	pos	I switched from my Deathadder, and even for my average sized hands (wear Men's glove size 9) It's taken some time to get used to how narrow this mouse feels in hand

2365	pos	My right ring finger was aching from having to stretch to grip the mouse properly
2366	neg	mouse lasted about 9 months and broke, not it just double clicks
2366	neg	I hope someone contacts me back for warranty work

2381	pos	Best mouse I have used hands down, believe the hype

2384	neg	Look for a different Logitech model or buy a different brand
2384	neg	Poor build quality
2384	neg	Not impressed with this
2385	pos	Best mouse I ever purchased
2386	pos	The dpi buttons are in an odd spot but I guess it could be so you don‚Äôt click them randomly
2387	pos	Grand son loves this with his new computer
2388	pos	I like the hole thing but the scroll wheel is not very good
2389	pos	This mouse is pretty good, if you can get it for a 40 USD price range

2390	neg	Me dieron un g602 y para el colmo esta usado
2391	neg	Do not get this mouse
2391	neg	It has a design flaw that will cause the left mouse button to stop working
2391	neg	Look up, "g502 left mouse button" and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about
2392	neg	Avoid this mouse unless you don't need to be able to click on anything, select multiple items
2392	neg	basically use the mouse for its intended purpose
2393	neg	The scrolling wheel did not work when I received it, have to send it back and will have to upgrade to something else
2393	neg	I'm guessing most mice don't ship broken out of the box like mine but still frustrating üëé
2394	pos	Best ever
2395	pos	This is an amazing piece of hardware
2395	pos	I will give it five stars, but the only fact that bothers me is about the scroll wheel, sometimes i press the side buttons when i press the middle click of the scroll wheel
2396	pos	My spouse is ecstatic about his new mouse
2396	pos	It's fantastic

2400	pos	Excellent gaming mouse
2400	pos	Wish it had a couple of more buttons; I use it to play WoW
2400	pos	It‚Äôs one of the most comfortable mouses I‚Äôve ever used

1089	pos	It is definitely more precise and feels better to use than the low cost brands
1090	neg	anyways, no logi products for me anymore
1090	neg	I like my old G5, but I guess logi does not make solid products anymore
1091	pos	mouse feels awesome in the hand, it was obviously used when it was shipped to me
1091	neg	There were no weights in the plastic bag it came in, and the gliders already had crud in them
1091	pos	The mouse though is fantastic, works well with the rest of my Logitech equipment
1092	pos	Good mouse with programable buttons
1093	pos	I play alot of games and require quick accurate equipment this works wonderfully

1094	pos	Great product and value
1095	pos	I got this mouse for gaming and it has worked great
1095	pos	the software great if you learn how to use itbuttons 4

1096	neg	They are totally useless
1096	neg	Even the software doesn't have an option to remap these 3 useless buttons
1096	neg	Total disappointment
1096	neg	It's sitting in my cupboard now along with other useless products
1097	pos	I have had it for a few months and it is holding up so far
1097	pos	It is pretty responsive
1098	neg	Like others have said before: whilst the mouse may be comfortable and works for a couple of months, I noticed while playing online matches that holding down the left click would no longer work
1098	neg	Any game that relied on me needing to hold it down only ended in frustration and apparently this is a known issue with an internal component
1098	neg	You can click regularly but anything longer than a second is pointless
1099	pos	Plugged it in & it just worked
1099	pos	The logitech software makes it super easy to customize the buttons, and the extra weights are perfect
1099	pos	Also the dual mode scroll wheel wasn't something I knew I needed, but now I love it
1100	neg	Ordered a new logitech mouse, received a used one
1101	pos	All I can say is that I love it
1101	pos	Logitech G-hub allows for nearly full customization of all mouse features

1104	pos	definitely  helpful
1104	pos	Best mouse I've had in a long time
1105	pos	The mouse is a big upgrade for me and whether i'm destroying small children in Warzone or grown men in Tarkov i can trust that my mouse will allow me to dispatch my foes at the optimal rate
1106	pos	I'm a big dude, and my hands fit comfortably around this mouse
1107	pos	High accuracy and love the customs option for all the buttons
1108	neg	This is very frustrating
1108	neg	I would expect better from a mouse at this price
1108	neg	I'm not going to purchase any logitech products in the future, nor would I recommend them to anyone else
1109	neg	But after a year of heavy use, the left click has stopped working
1109	neg	Their quality has declined
1109	neg	Do NOT get this mouse if you want something that lasts
1110	neg	this is honestly sad because this mouse is near perfect the only other problem I've is the weird button layout  I'm always accidentally pressing buttons when I don't intend to
1110	neg	But to its credit I did have this mouse for a year and a half before it broke still disappointing for a 60$ mouse though
1111	pos	The mouse has a great feel, better than the wireless IMO (which I broke) This mouse is also  more durable to abuse
1112	neg	The double click issue is insane and I've been trying to fix it for a year
1113	pos	A few months out and enjoying this mouse being able to adjust the weight is a plus
1113	pos	I like the feel of the mouse it was a great upgrade from my G302

1114	pos	I use it on PS4 and it‚Äôs awesome
1115	pos	Love this mouse for gaming
1115	pos	I love it so far
1116	pos	Easily the best value gaming mouse on the market
1116	pos	The cord is a nice lightweight material
1117	neg	Really 100% scam and they know it mouse breaks after a few months starts to double and miss click and feet wear out no matter what after a year they don‚Äôt make replacements they need to be sued like Microsoft for stick drift they know of the clicking issue I have owned 6 mice now last one I‚Äôm buying
1118	pos	I love this mouse it's the only one I use
1118	pos	They are durable and the colors are nice
1119	neg	So disappointed
1120	neg	Left click will release at random and will double click at random only after six months of use was not worth the money
1121	pos	Definitely a comfortable mouse
1121	pos	I am a YouTuber and have been using it for a couple days now, and it has been great so far
1121	pos	Will update if there are any issues but other than that, this mouse is smooth and won‚Äôt slide at all on your desk, which my last one did, the weighting stuff comes In a nice packed case so you can change them whenever, and I love the minimal but noticeable RGB, can‚Äôt wait until my Blackwidow keyboard comes so I can match it with this mouse
1121	pos	It really is top of the line
1122	pos	Great mouse, good weight that you can adjust with the included additional weights
1122	pos	I have one weight in it and it feels great
1123	pos	They fit perfectly in larger hands, are very quick to respond and customize
1123	pos	I also like that they have weight - most other mice are too light and therefore harder to control
1123	pos	Highly recommended
1124	pos	This logitech is comfortable,  feels great and the software is easy to use and I haven't had any problems
1125	neg	Loved this mouse until the left clicking completely failed, ~9 months into ownership
1125	neg	Don't buy this mouse, don't buy it on this website
1126	pos	Accurate and has a nice weight to it
1126	pos	I myself like heavier mice, so the option to add weights to it is a big yes
1127	neg	Be aware that if you buy this mouse, it has a very high chance of developing a known double clicking issue
1128	neg	It doesn't give you a clear indication of your clicks which I feels is absolutely necessary in a good mouse
1129	pos	Absolutely fantastic mouse for 7 months
1129	neg	Double click problem started a few weeks ago
1130	pos	Versatile, looks really cool and lots of buttons
1130	neg	Unfortunately it forced my hand into an awkward position mainly because of the button where the thumb should rest
1130	neg	Too uncomfortable
1131	pos	There are no cons in all the product i've used on logitech product which is really good
1131	pos	Its really good with extra 3 buttons on the left
1132	pos	Great in all the ways advertised
1133	neg	The mouse wheel is one of the biggest issues i had with this mouse
1133	neg	It got extremely flimsy as time went on and when doing flick shots i can feel the mouse wheel smack the sides when moving the mouse in rapid successions
1134	pos	This was the best mouse 4 friends and I could've asked for
1134	neg	not worth it unless u set them up at tournaments or something where they have no use to the wheel
1135	pos	Solid mouse, I was worried about it being 'heavy' but its perfect for me tbh
1135	pos	I love the dpi lock button aka the sniper button, really clutch in games
1135	pos	Feels pretty ergonomic and I haven't had a problem with it so far
1136	pos	Good quality mouse however the price is lower in stores
1137	neg	I've always loved Logitech products but this mouse has problems that make it unusable
1137	neg	Accurate drag and drop is near impossible
1138	pos	I can't say anything bad about this mouse
1138	pos	I got it for my 11yo son's birthday, and he loves it
1138	pos	I programmed some of the buttons for him, and am perfectly ecstatic by his love of this mouse
1138	pos	Definitely recommend
1139	pos	I really like the tilt wheel, good for strafing etc
1139	pos	So many more buttons available and looks awesome
1140	pos	I love this mouse
1140	pos	Super sensitive and the programmable buttons are awesome as well as the extra weights it comes with
1142	pos	it actually looks very clean, especially in a low light settings, and the dpi adjustment on the mouse itself is very useful for gaming and web browsing
1142	pos	the rgb screen sampler is also a super cool feature that i wish my keyboard had as well
1142	pos	in conclusion, i am very satisfied with this purchase, and I‚Äôll update this review depending on the state of the mouse

1145	neg	Only complaint is the wheel is way too sensitive

1161	pos	Would definitely recommend
1163	pos	It has a great feel, is fairly light and the software was easy to use
1164	neg	My main issue is just the fact that the switch isn't well made and breaks in mere months
1165	pos	Got this for my boyfriend for the holidays and he said he loves it so much more than is older mouse

1191	pos	The mouse is very solid and the weight of it is great
1191	pos	I‚Äôve been using the G305 mouse for awhile and it‚Äôs a good mouse but I have a tendency to pick it up accidentally while playing a game because of its light weight and I wanted a mouse that weighed more and this is the perfect mouse for it

1213	pos	Awesome mouse
1213	neg	Only issue the right n left click are the first things to start messing up

1318	pos	Great mouse, I look forward to as many years with it as I did with my last Logitech mouse
1319	pos	Fast, swift, fits great, much better than a regular one
1322	pos	10/10 would buy again
1323	pos	Video Player is loading
1324	pos	But when I do use it, it is perfect and it molds perfectly with my hand (which is kind of big)
1325	neg	I bought this twice and again I have problem - this time around scroll tilt function (left and right) - such that it just doesn‚Äôt tilt like my G600
1325	neg	So disappointing
1328	neg	The dpi buttons are in the wrong place ,very bad design  ,this is not a gaming mouse by far , unless you want your mouse moving at Mach 10 across your screen , quality is good  nice feel , and there is no way to disable the dpi buttons
1329	pos	Mouse was fantastic
1330	pos	Pretty lights
1330	pos	Accurate pointer
1331	neg	But they have almost no durability- my last mouse had a double clicking issue within a year, and now this one is either double clicking the right mouse button or doesn't let me hold the button down
1333	pos	one of the best mice ive ever owned
1333	pos	durable, accurate, no stupid nonsense
1333	pos	just good mousing

1344	pos	Responsiveness is at the speed of thought
1344	pos	Highly recommended
1345	neg	I bought this seeing a ton of good reviews but when I got it I was extremely disappointed
1345	neg	0/10 would not recommend
1346	pos	Great budget mouse
1346	pos	I was on the fence about getting a gaming mouse but after using this one for one month I love it
1347	neg	After only a couple months of using the mouse, the scroll wheel broke and does not allow me to click down with it
1347	neg	Scrolling is good, but I am unhappy with the clicking not working

1350	pos	It‚Äôs so good I don‚Äôt even have to say anything about it
1352	pos	This was a gift for my adult grandson and he loved it and says its the best gaming mouse that he's ever used
1353	neg	I've had this mouse for less than a year and the left mouse button will send double clicks on its own
1353	neg	At first I thought it was just me not clicking correctly but it's gotten progressively worse over the past few months that the mouse is almost unusable
1356	neg	This mouse cost too much for a 8 month life span
1356	neg	The left click is now useless with zero accuracy
1358	pos	I bought this for gaming, I like it
1359	neg	I never leave reviews on Amazon, but this mouse deserves a horrible one
1359	neg	It started the random double clicking after only using it for 8 months
1360	pos	I‚Äôve had this mouse for about a year now and it still works as good as the day I got it
1360	pos	It‚Äôs overall a great mouse
1360	pos	It feels really good in my hand and I like the fact that you can add weights to it to make it heavier
1361	neg	About 6 months in and I'm starting to notice that the left mouse button will double-click which is really inconvenient in games
1361	neg	It also has issues now with dragging a window
1363	neg	Scroll wheel stopped working after a month and 1 day
1364	neg	The mouse's right-click doesn't work any longer after less than one year of ownership
1365	pos	This mouse is incredibly high quality and isn‚Äôt a $300 gimmick
1365	pos	Very affordable and accurate, improved my performance both physically (grip) and mentally (lack of frustration  from horrendous DPI issues)9
1366	neg	The software to program the buttons doesn‚Äôt work unless you have the game you want to play installed on the computer you are using to configure the mouse
1368	pos	Use this mouse nearly daily and it feels good in my hand no problems
1369	neg	I had been using this mouse for almost 2 years, but a couple of months ago it started to double click randomly, there is no real easy fix to this problem and it was very annoying
1370	pos	I use the mouse for playing video games, and it works great
1373	pos	I upgraded from logitech g402 to g502 hero, and it is totally worth it, I love logitech mouse's and they are my favorite, the mouse is awesome and have smooth movement and it can add weight to it, it even have 11 programmable buttons, no wonder why this is ninja's mouse that he plays fortnite with, for value of money it much better than other junk mouses I have use before
1373	pos	Really you guys should get it and give it a try of never try logitech mouse's, they are the best üíôüëå
1374	neg	Expect the switches that drive the left and right buttons to fail after a year

1377	pos	Price was right
1378	pos	Works well for gaming

1380	neg	But after only just 2 months of using the mouse the left click started to not work it would double click when i didn't mean to or stutter when i held down left click i don't usually write reviews but this has been a repeated issue with the G502 mice and it's really annoying to have to buy new mice over and over again

1386	pos	I love the ergonomic design and the look of it
1386	neg	There is only one thing bad about this mouse: the scroll wheel
1387	pos	Feels amazing, I love the extra weight and the metal feeling scroll wheel is my favorite part
1389	pos	It feels 10x more accurate to me when aiming
1390	pos	Nice, I can program a couple of key combinations to be button clicks
1391	pos	Great mice
1394	neg	Holding the right mouse button would continuously register new clicks, so trying to pan the camera in games would create stutters and general lack of responsiveness
1395	neg	Two of them arrived with broken scrolling wheel and 3rd broke after two weeks
1397	pos	Great quality, the user interface on their software is extremely easy to use, you can even set up different profiles for different games
1397	neg	The only downside is that this thing is VERY sensitive

1401	neg	A little over a month using it and the double click/not holding the click issue came up like many people have stated in the review section
1401	neg	Its not worth the money for such a basic design flaw (as many have had the same exact issue)
1402	neg	The left click button has an intermittent issue that will cause this mouse to fail
1403	pos	Love the sensitivity and programing options
1408	pos	Over all very good for the priceL
1409	neg	Received this product and all but one light on the side doesn't work
1409	neg	Very disappointed, the lighting was a big part of why I chose this mouse over others similar
1410	neg	Right mouse button starts releasing itself when held down
1410	neg	Cleaning with wipes and compressed air cannot fix
1410	neg	Suspect cheap design for right mouse button
1412	pos	It's been a solid and reliable choice for me for years and I'm not planning on leaving soon
1412	pos	Highly recommend this one for the price
1413	pos	Long high quality usb cable, ample extra buttons, feels great with included weights added
1413	pos	Perfect for the price for high apm gaming

1425	pos	This has to be the best gaming mouse I have purchased
1425	pos	I used to be a fan of Corsair's but after my wheel broke (no warranty) I decided to try out Logitech's
1425	pos	Feels great, has a great weight to it (i like it on the heavier side)
1425	pos	Looks are awesome too
1425	pos	I like the option of adjusting the wheel, this is a new feature for me and I actually find myself using it from time to time (depends on the game)
1426	neg	after falling off the desk the middle button started randomly clicking when scrolling and scrolling would skip lines or not work
1427	pos	Great build quality and multiple options available to configure the sensitivity, colors and weight distribution

1502	pos	This mouse was the best mouse that I ever used
1502	pos	So comfortable in the hand and it had many aspects that will give you the best experience
1502	neg	The only problem is that in about 1 year the mouses left button will become an issue
1502	neg	Sometimes it will not respond when you use it
1503	pos	I love this mouse
1503	neg	Only issue I have with it is that I'll accidentally hit the mode switch and have to cycle back to the correct mode for whatever I'm doing

1599	pos	Absolutely my favorite mouse I've ever used
1599	pos	Using all the weights feels great for gaming and work
1599	pos	Extreme customization options, great paired with G910 keyboard üëç
1600	neg	It's just not comfortable
1600	neg	I've used many mouses since the 90s and this is one of the least comfortable I've touched
1600	neg	You can't easily do the lift, it doesn't work well on many surfaces
1601	pos	Mouse feels great and Logitech seems to have pretty good software
1602	neg	Mouse didn't last very long
1602	neg	As for this one, problems arose not even 3 months later

1611	neg	every single button on the mouse (left, right, middle, and all of the side buttons) started to double/triple click on a single press after a couple months of use
1611	neg	customer support and the warranty i got were entirely useless, so now I just have a broken brick of a mouse that i can't return/replace or use
1612	pos	Good mouse for price
1613	pos	This mouse has a sleek design that fits in my hand nicely
1613	pos	The mouse works awesome and the customizability with the Logitech software is amazing
1613	neg	However, a major issue that I have with the mouse is it randomly disconnects when I‚Äôm using it
1614	neg	This mouse started having double click issues and issues with not being able to drag and drop items after about one month randomly, as time went on it became consistent
1616	neg	The absolutely horrible switches will only last you a matter of months
1617	pos	I love the extra side buttons
1617	pos	But quality is great, cord is nice and long so I can have my pc a good ways away from where I'm using the device
1619	neg	At first it seemed great, but just after a few months, the left click button becomes inconsistently activated, which not only aggravated day to day work, but makes high stakes FPS not feasible for the hardcore gamers
1621	pos	Best mouse I ever used in a while
1622	neg	Bought June 2019, in roughly a year the house has begun to double click, I can‚Äôt recommend based on how quickly it broke down

1630	pos	Feels very sturdy and premium and very comfortable to use as a dude with slightly bigger hands
1630	pos	100% a must buy in my opinion if you are even slightly a pc gaming enthusiast
1631	pos	Comfortable to hold and use mouse
1633	neg	I love the mouse it fits my hand perfectly and the buttons are in convenient spots but the accidental double clicking ruins any type of consistency for gaming and also navigating web pages and such its just annoying
1634	pos	My son loves this mouse
1635	pos	This is definitely a 5 star mouse
1636	pos	this mouse is great for larger hands, feels good, buttons take a bit to get used to but can be useful for fps games along with the weights
1637	pos	Fits my hand perfectly, and the weight is perfect with the included weights
1638	pos	Perfect weight
1639	pos	Decent price for a nice mouse
1639	pos	Great for gaming, nice software allows pretty easy customization (macros and whatnot), and ergonomic for everyday use: working or gaming, personally feels nice to me
1640	pos	Great quality works amazingly I mean if you are looking at this mouse you should know how good anything Logitech is and it definitely keeps that great standard
1641	pos	Lasted me longer than any other mouse (almost a year), and very nice
1641	pos	If you just want a nice durable gaming mouse, look no further than this one
1643	pos	Good product
1644	neg	I want to like this, but the driver applications they make you install DOES NOT WORK on the Apple M1 laptop
1645	neg	I‚Äôve only had this thing for a couple months now and every 5-10 minutes while using the Logitech program it gives me a ‚Äú backend connection issues ‚Äú I have tried ever vacant slot on my pc to no avail
1645	neg	This is very annoying and I expected more from a high end mouse I spent my money on
1645	neg	I wasted a lot of money on this and got screwed in the long run
1646	neg	Right mouse button sticks causing delays
1647	neg	I haven't opened the mouse and the box it self is old and oily i think i got a used version
1648	pos	The weights and software to edit all buttons the way I like are great
1649	pos	It's a magnificent product that you can modify in weight, I personally have only 1 in it at the moment and it is the best Mouse I have had for everything
1649	pos	Nothing compares to this mouse
1650	pos	Good for gaming
1651	pos	Great for gaming, easy on hands, comfortable to use

1663	pos	Its exactly what he expected for the price and is very happy
1664	neg	I then bought the G502 HERO to replace it and in less than a year the same issue happened
1664	neg	Right Mouse button fails on click, for gaming specifically it sucks massively
1665	neg	Only dislike is that I'm not a fan of the weird rubber/svelte material that your thumb rests on, the feel is strange and neither slippery or sticky, somewhat fails to have friction with the thumb
1666	pos	Its the g502, fits in your hand well and has good features
1668	neg	These mice suck and the middle mouse click is trash
1670	neg	The right click does not hold down at random times and support is useless
1671	pos	I like how simple it is to change its settings
1672	neg	Awful quality

1679	neg	This is the 2nd Logitech mouse I've had where the right mouse button stopped working correctly
1679	neg	Garbage product
1679	neg	Find another brand, this one is terrible
1681	neg	After using it almost daily for about  2 months I'm getting constant double clicks
1681	neg	Seeing as I use this for gaming this has been a major pain
1681	neg	I've read this problem a lot with this mouse, good size, but bad clicks
1682	neg	after 3 months a button stopped working, I do not recommend it for games
1684	neg	The mouse feet is cut to the edge an unsticking an the click on the mouse works on an off this is very bad I cant even use it anymore an I jus got bought it recently
1685	neg	Mouse didn't last long
1685	neg	it started having really bad double click issues after only a few months, I would avoid it
1686	pos	I liked the feel and mousewheel for casual use
1686	neg	But in intense gaming situations the mouse wheel would rattle causing issues in aiming
1687	pos	Great mouse and is holding up very well
1687	pos	I like it though
1688	neg	I loved this mouse until the left click stopped working
1688	neg	It happened pretty fast and will not hold down or allow you to drag and highlight
1688	neg	Very annoying for work and gaming
1690	neg	I don‚Äôt know why but the scroll wheel breaks so freakin easily for no reason
1691	neg	Within the first month an issue with the left click double clicking began
1691	neg	Then the issues with GHub started
1691	neg	If it weren't for these issues I'd be happy with it, but unfortunately it's trash and I won't be buying another Logitech product
1692	pos	Very comfortable, good amount of buttons on mouse for custom keybinds
1692	pos	Weight adjustment
1692	neg	I just dont like the mouse scroll design
1695	neg	its now 100% unusable
1695	neg	highly disappointed in this mouse, it should have lasted far longer for being an 80$ mouse

1707	pos	I like the ability to adjust the weight of the mouse, and the precise sensor
1707	pos	The overall look and feel is excellent, but the scroll wheel is my favorite part of the mouse
1708	pos	Best mouse I've used in this price range for gaming
1710	pos	It's a great fit for my hand, I use the palm grip where i let my arm do most of the work

1712	pos	This is a great product
1713	pos	So far this one is working great
1716	pos	Very responsive , great product for price

1719	pos	Speed is on point
1720	pos	Good quality mouse
1724	neg	The mouse wheel seems loose and clicks on it's own when I move the mouse too quick and the pads on the bottom are bubbling and not in good shape
1724	neg	Would not recommend and am very disappointed with the product
1725	pos	Love this mouse and the new hero sensor
1725	pos	You can add weights program buttons and love the infinite scroll wheel
1726	neg	This was a 5/5 star mouse for me until it developed the double clicking issue after only a month
1726	neg	It happens quite consistently now, making me paranoid whenever using it which makes it now useless to me
1727	pos	Amazing mouse, my son is loving it
1729	neg	It became a real issue when trying to play games and needed to hold down the button

1737	pos	I loved that it came with weights and love the way the clicking sounds and feels
1738	pos	In my opinion, best gaming mouse on the market
1739	neg	Complete junk
1742	neg	After you use the scroll wheel, there's like a 50% chance the scroll wheel reverses once afterward
1742	neg	Maybe I just have a defective model, either way it's terrible
1743	pos	The mouse works great
1746	pos	Sets up easily very fast and accurate
1746	pos	The free wheel is a great feature
1748	pos	Been using it for my new gaming setup and it performs extremely well
1749	neg	Just like some other dude here mentioned, I had the same problem
1749	neg	Dented box, fingerprints on the weights, strong smell of them being oiled and scratches all over the mouse - not cool at all considering I paid the full price of 80$ and got something renewed and used which is worth 40$ at best
1749	neg	Absolutely disappointing
1750	pos	Works nice and smooth
1751	neg	As of this week, about 9 months in, started experiencing issues with double clicking
1754	pos	Perfect mouse with no driver issues  like the razor crap mouse I replaced
1754	pos	Price is right and the performance is even better
1757	pos	Ergonomically it fits my hand well
1758	neg	Idk why everyone loves this mouse, at least to me it feels really weird in hand and not the most optimal gaming mouse out there
1759	neg	Mouse lasted for barely over half a year before succumbing to the infamous "double click & drag" disease
1761	neg	The material for thumb rest is very difficult to clean and easy to destroy
1762	neg	This thing which is simply spin out of control, pin the mouse to the top of the screen, or the bottom of the screen and really mess up your orientation at random
1764	pos	The sensor is excellent,  buttons are good with good clicks
1764	pos	The g hub software is good as well
1764	pos	I like the aesthetics too

1771	pos	Good mice for the price, the Logitech ghub allows for alot of customization
1772	pos	Even improved my productivity after getting these

1773	neg	so, i have had major issues with the click and click and drag
1774	pos	It appears to be very robust and responsive to inputs
1774	pos	The customization is a great addition

1777	pos	Great gaming mouse
1777	pos	For the price this is far better than any Naga

1779	pos	For the average user I know it‚Äôs an excellent mouse

1793	pos	Love this mouse and it works great
1795	pos	Got it for a Christmas present for my son and he absolutely loves it says it works great for all of his gaming needs

1801	pos	Can't get a better mouse for the price
1801	pos	Built well and feels comfortable
1801	pos	I like that you can add the weights to get that just right feel
1802	neg	It's still kinda usable, but the unintentional double clicks can be annoying and actually quite dangerous
1804	pos	Much more comfortable and responsive than my old one
1806	pos	My sons used this for gaming, it react very fast , comfortable , agronomic, even afrer a lot of hours of playing their hands fills great , without any pain, another great product from Logitech technology
1810	pos	Good hand fit, thinner then the Corsair I was using, very light but does come with weights if your in to that sorta thing
1815	pos	I bought it specifically for the weights, which allows me to make it the perfect weight for sniping
1817	pos	I like the look and feel of this mouse, for gaming, and surfing the we, --it has more than enough buttons to be assigned to all the tasks,
1818	neg	Left click stopped working

1835	pos	Its very comfortable
1840	pos	At first, I liked it, it was nice and sturdy, it looked good and felt good
1840	neg	But after a while of using it, I noticed that it kept hiccuping, like the cursor on the screen would stop while I was moving the mouse, this proved very difficult to deal with since it refused to move at one point while I was playing a game
1840	neg	A waste of 50 bucks
1841	pos	Bought it for fps gaming and so far loving it, the added features such as the dpi button, scroll lock and the ability to balance weight according to your will is quite impressive
1843	pos	Feels great in your hand and is customizable with the weights
1843	pos	The number of buttons to program works out really well for me playing everything from EFT and Cod to WoW and New World

1864	pos	The design is solid and feels durable
1866	neg	The "customizeable features" are horrible
1866	neg	You can't customize all the buttons, only like 3 of them, and when you do change the features they keep resetting and you have to go through the whole process of customizing everying again

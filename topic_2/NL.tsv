346	neg	I'm not sure how this mouse is so highly rated if this is such a blatantly obvious manufacturers defect
346	neg	Go with a different brand
346	neg	Yes, the mouse is flashy and fun and has a lot of features, but go with something made with better quality materials
347	pos	I have very small hands, and the struggle is real when it comes to finding a gaming mouse
347	pos	This mouse, is still fairly large for me, but compared to a lot of other gaming mice out there, the contours and just the shape of it allow my hand to feel more comfortable holding, resting on it, and using it
347	pos	Pros: Comfortable
347	pos	Adjustable weight
347	pos	High quality build
347	pos	Customizable dpi presets
347	pos	Customizable rgb backlighting
347	pos	Cons: Still fairly large for my hand
347	pos	More buttons than I need (which is probably a pro for most people
347	pos	lol)
347	pos	The software must load for your rgb settings to take
347	pos	I think my biggest dislike is the convoluted and confusing software (Logitech Hub) that doesn't really give you clear instructions on how to use it
347	pos	Overall, I'm very pleased with this mouse choice so far
347	pos	There is a lot for me to learn regarding the Logitech Hub software if I ever care to dive deeper into it
348	pos	Great mouse with many options
348	pos	Can use macros and set buttons to do anything
348	pos	Has RGB options too
348	pos	Makes gaming easier with greater detail (compared to my old mouse)
348	pos	Very comfortable rubberized outer shell
348	pos	Good heft to it without even installing weights
348	pos	I'm able to leave the side lights on, and leave the logo on a breathing type pattern, so at a glance I can tell what my DPI is
348	pos	You can also make it only light up for a few seconds after input, but then you have to tap it to check
348	pos	Really nice options
349	pos	First I will say this is a quality gaming mouse
349	pos	It's well built, glides great on a hard mousepad
349	pos	buttons have a nice feel
349	pos	BUT if you have a wide hand (my palm is about 3 3/4 in wide) and use a palm gripping style this mouse is not for you
349	pos	I find it to be too narrow, both my middle and pinky fingers are dragging on the pad any my index is constantly activating the +DPI button when I am pressing button 1 (this was so bad I disabled the +DPI button altogether)
349	pos	I tried to like this mouse: worked and gamed with it for a week, but it's going back :(
350	neg	I purchased my G502 back in March, when it looked like I'd be working from home a lot more
350	neg	I needed a new mouse, and I game a lot, so my research led me to the G502 Hero
350	neg	I was very happy with it for the first three months; customizable buttons using the Logitech software was a breeze, and I loved the feel of the device
350	neg	Then, after four months of daily use, I noticed the mouse was double-clicking by itself sometimes
350	neg	Other times, the mouse would release a click while I was trying to drag something, which led to a lot of misplaced files, and unintended highlighting of text
350	neg	There is no rhyme or reason as to when these events happen, or in what application - it just randomly happens
350	neg	I'm very unhappy with the quality of the hardware here, despite the device's many positive aspects
350	neg	Since I'm already past Amazon's return cutoff, I'm going to have to file a warranty claim with Logitech, so that should be fun
350	neg	I'd advise buyers to avoid this mouse, because this appears to be a widespread issue
351	pos	It is labeled as a gaming mouse but it is a great mouse in general for every day use
351	pos	It is ergonomic, comfortable and smooth while moving
351	pos	It feels practically weightless while moving across the mousepad and it is the heaviest mouse I own
351	pos	The scroll wheels is one of the best I have ever used, it has two modes, a free scroll and a normal scroll
351	pos	Free scrolling is practically friction-less, and that's a good and bad thing
351	pos	Good when you like to scroll easily and sometimes bad when you move to another window and it keeps scrolling but that's mostly user error fault, not of the mouse
351	pos	The customization is crazy
351	pos	You can configure the 11 buttons to do all different things, not just the default mouse options
351	pos	I find this useful as I am always switching back and forth between the keyboard and mouse and sometimes I need quick actions on the mouse, this mouse can do that
351	pos	You can do keyboard shortcuts such as Alt+F4, or have it "click" a certain key to do something
351	pos	See the attached image
351	pos	Overall a great mouse and I highly recommend, the quality and feature-set is unmatched to any other mouse I have used
352	neg	I just needed a replacement mouse
352	neg	Should have went with a $10 device, but no-o-o-o
352	neg	I can't find a way to turn the lighting off
352	neg	I figured out how to slow the pointer down from ballistic speed
352	neg	Getting the wheel to roll in human units is vexing
352	neg	Just pack the manual in with the mouse
352	neg	Your LGHUB software is impossible to read
352	neg	(When did light gray on dark gray become acceptable
352	neg	) I guess it's my fault for being 70 years old
353	pos	I've had this mouse for a year now and I have no complaints whatsoever about it
353	pos	The software works great and I'm not an RGB fanatic so I really appreciate the simple accents on the mouse that I can customize
353	pos	I also love how I can make different profiles for different applications, mostly games, and how customizable the whole mouse is
353	pos	I have to say tho, this is probably not a mouse for people with small hands
353	pos	But for me, it fits comfortably in my hand has stood up to some abuse really well
353	pos	As far as the adjustable weights go, I think they are great but not a deal-breaker
353	pos	Overall, an amazing mouse that I could confidently recommend to anyone who wants a high-quality mouse or one with the extra buttons
354	neg	Like many others around here I have had a lot of issue with this mouse
354	neg	I have owned Logitech mice in the past and all of them I just exchanged after a few years because of a newer/cooler model
354	neg	My old Proteus Core worked for 3 years without issues until I replaced it
354	neg	Same with the Logitech iFeel Optical (bought that 2 decades ago and never failed on me)
354	neg	It is a real shame that Logitech clearly decided to ignore the issue plaguing this mouse
354	neg	I like the ergonomics and the features (I really like mice with "sniper" buttons), but if the mouse doesn't last 6-12 months its just not worth
354	neg	Logitech did replace the mouse, but it started having issues as well after 8-12 months
354	neg	Same thing with the Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum
354	neg	Loved that headset (Battlefield 1/V sounds amazing
354	neg	Love the directional/positional audio) but it is plagued with issues as well
354	neg	I really hope Logitech steps up their game for future products
354	neg	They need to build things to last like they used to do a few years ago
355	pos	I've owned Logitech products for years and have always been very happy
355	pos	This mouse is no exception
355	pos	All in all it's a great mouse, built well, look good
355	pos	However there are a few things I want to point out
355	pos	First the mouse wheel is metal with no rubber "Grip" like my last 2 mice
355	pos	This makes scrolling the wheel a bit uncomfortable and it FEELS like it's imprecise
355	pos	The second thing is based on a comparison to my old Logitech MX  Master which was a  bit larger with a better surface for resting your hand
355	pos	With the MX your hand could simply rest on the mouse, supporting it almost entirely with little effort
355	pos	With the G502 it's narrower and more "humped" so that I am forced to GRIP it the whole time and after just a bit my hand gets sore and cramped
356	pos	Another great gaming mouse from Logitech
356	pos	Light, good amount of buttons and a temporary DPI change button
356	pos	Very responsive, and a good amount of cord
356	pos	Once connected and with G Hub installed, you can customize and change the mouse G color as you want
356	pos	Tracks fine so matter the DPI
356	pos	G Hub has gotten better and makes it easy to fine tune the mouse
356	pos	Bottom pops off easily if you want to add weights
357	pos	I had been using a g500 for almost 10 years
357	pos	I loved that mouse as someone who uses a full palm grip and has larger hands
357	pos	When the buttons finally started to give me the double click failure I looked around for a solid replacement
357	pos	I was recommended the g502 from multiple people and read about it as a replacement on multiple sites
357	pos	I pulled the trigger and grabbed one because my other mouse was not really functional anymore
357	pos	The mouse does good clicky things, all the buttons feel solid and the mouse is responsive
357	pos	The thumb rest is great well positioned, but the mouse is too narrow overall for a good palm grip
357	pos	I also use a write pad with my mouse and so the sharp falloff combined with the narrow body mean that only half my palm is actually on the mouse
357	pos	I either have to scrunch my hand up to keep my hand off the pad or drag part of my hand around
357	pos	I think this mouse is probably an amazing mouse with someone with smaller hands, or someone who prefers a claw grip
357	pos	However, if you got some wide hands like I do and use a full palm grip you might want to keep looking
358	pos	Solid mouse for any gamer, very accurate and easily customizable
358	pos	Works amazing with my Xbox One and my PC
358	pos	Software is very intuitive and great to use
358	pos	Buttons are easily programmable and useful for games where having immediate access to a command is crucial
358	pos	Would recommend 100%
358	pos	To address “used” mouse deliveries, this mouse came in brand new packaging, mouse looked like it was sent straight from the factory although weights were not really clean (manufacturing and packaging processes usually make it look this way) but felt brand new so i wouldn’t hesitate purchasing this as it is a great buy
358	pos	For those thinking your scroll wheel is broken if it spins freely, theres a button that you can press and it switches it to free spin mode or normal mode so don’t fix it if it ain't broke
358	pos	Only problem is getting off your PC after :)
358	pos	One of my favorite mice of all time
359	neg	I had the previous version of this mouse which I loved, so when it finally died after years of use I figured this was the next logical step
359	neg	Sadly I can't say the purchase experience has been all that great for me
359	neg	While I still love the features this mouse provides it didn't even last a year
359	neg	Within 6 yo 8 months it began experiencing a stutter on the right mouse button which spread to the left as well
359	neg	Looking online it's a pretty widely known issue, which they even put out a firmware update to attempt to fix
359	neg	When that didn't help I contacted customer support to potentially get a replacement, they were, to my surprise, absolutely no help
359	neg	They instructed me to clean the mouse and provided a link to a webpage that would count "rapid double clicks" and requested that I get video footage testing the mouse
359	neg	However the webpage doesn't pick any unusual behavior up, but the mouse displays the same behavior across multiple games
359	neg	So long story short I'm stuck with a sort of reliable mouse
359	neg	Needless to say I'm likely to buy another mouse but I'm not so sure it'll be another Logitech at this point
360	pos	I would love to give this mouse a 5, but there’s just a couple small things
360	pos	It is just a tad too small, but then I have relatively big hands, so if it doesn’t fit like a glove that’s okay
360	pos	The rest of the mouse could be a little more metal, as most of it is plastic
360	pos	Over all I recommend this, it’s a very nice clicky mouse wheel, so swapping to the desired secondary/ primary/ heavy on destiny is easy
360	pos	If your hands are longer than 9
360	pos	5” from thumb to pinky spread out, if look for something else
361	pos	Let me start this of by saying oh my the buttons
361	pos	Coming from a simple left/right scroll mouse this was a shock to me especially relating to how I hold this mouse
361	pos	With the ridiculous amount of toggles you are met with an endless array of control mapping as long as the program/game registers those as applicable binds
361	pos	(some do not unfortunately and will register that button to a key on your keyboard as well overwriting it’s original bind) The mouse itself is quite hearty but has a solid feel to it and features the endless scroll function on the mouse wheel
361	pos	Also the sensor is wonderful and can be adjusted up to 16000 dpi which no ordinary human would need
361	pos	One flaw I would like to point out would be the feet on this mouse
361	pos	They really hold the whole 502 hero package back feeling cheap and overall lacking quality commonly found on mice within the “gaming” genre of peripherals
361	pos	If you have larger hands and like the feeling of a hefty mouse this is a valid contender as I’ve come to enjoy using it very much
362	pos	I am the office monkey
362	pos	I thought it will be cool to use a mouse my 17 year old nephew suggested, but I forgot my age
362	pos	In the haste of being a new age nerd, I bought a heavy mouse meant for gamers with cool leds
362	pos	Never understood the need for LEDs
362	pos	It’s a smooth mouse and heavy heavy one (not like of your dumbbells 😀 though)
362	pos	I love it
362	pos	It wakes up my Mac mini whenever I want and moves smoothly across the display
362	pos	So in summary, a great mouse for a gamer and a very good one for everyone else
363	pos	I bought this as it was recommended for people with larger hands in a number of reviews, but it is definitely made for smaller hands
363	pos	My hands are not really that big, but my thumb doesn't even fit into the thumb groove
363	pos	Using this, I'd have to switch from a palm grip to a finger grip, so I'll keep looking
363	pos	Also, when you set the mouse wheel to "click" mode, it really is difficult to scroll the wheel up
363	pos	Down works fine, but my finger just slips over the wheel when scrolling up
364	pos	I am becoming a big fan of logitech this mouse looks Fresh feels fresh is everything you'd expect I hear the pros gamers dont use these types for FPS games but I'm having no issues owning call of duty lobbiesI have long fingers and I use a claw grip I'm very satisfied
364	pos	I also use this often why playing Xbox one with my pc friends on cod modern warfare
364	pos	My only complaint could be a positive for a lot of people is that there is a DPI switch directly along the main right click button drives me crazy but I think I'm getting used to it
365	neg	I can concur with other reviewers that this mouse over time develops left click issues
365	neg	Namely in my case dragging windows is a point of endless frustration as this mouse constantly drops the window
365	neg	Double clicks have been noticed as well
365	neg	I really really liked this mouse and when the first one went bad after about a year of use, I thought I might of just been unlucky, and bought a second one
365	neg	Lo and behold here I am a year later wishing I'd just bought a different Mouse
365	neg	I've been using Logitech mouses for 15+ years and these two mice are the only ones I have had an issue with
365	neg	They won't get me a third time
366	pos	This mouse is extremely well made
366	pos	I quite like using it
366	pos	I currently use this mouse with a Xim Apex on my Xbox One X
366	pos	It is highly customizable and it feels great in your hand
366	pos	The texture on it is excellent
366	pos	It fits in my average sized hands perfectly
366	pos	I can click all the buttons with ease
366	pos	It is a bit on the heavy side; however, this is not a bother to me
366	pos	It's still light enough to turn on some bots
366	pos	The software for this mouse really is not that bad either
366	pos	I see a lot of other people complaining about it
366	pos	It's easy to navigate and customize the mouse
366	pos	I am not sure what their issues with the software is
366	pos	All in all, I love this mouse for gaming
367	neg	It is way too complicated for the various modes- I am still trying to figure out the DPI modes, and then the left click starts failing
367	neg	Won't hold fire, won't fire 100% first click
367	neg	So I tested it by drag selecting text and clicking to place the curser in the middle of text, same crap my Corsair started doing after a year
367	neg	So I know I have been gaming like crazy due to this covid crap, but for $50 I expect a gazillion clicks
367	neg	Could do without umpteen levels of DPI variation- the Corsair was much, much easier to use
367	neg	Going through Logitech warranty now
368	pos	Been a Logitech mouse owner since the mouseman optical in 2002 playing Battlefield 1942
368	pos	Since then I've have the 510, the 510, MX, MXLazer, G5, G7, then I gave up on Logitech for a bit because they changed the familiar feel and shape of the mice I loved
368	pos	Then these came up and I gave one a go
368	pos	That was it, welcome back to my gaming setup and everyone I know's setup too
368	pos	These mice are the perfect shape, rgb, weights
368	pos	what's not to love
368	pos	They last too
368	pos	It's hard to sell a new mouse to someone that never gets rid of one that works, but I'm totally satisfied and bought a second for a backup just in case
368	pos	And my new kitten approves
369	neg	Terrible, I will never get another one
369	neg	It stopped working after 3 weeks
369	neg	I tried all of the troubleshooting tips, (e
369	neg	g
369	neg	rebooting, delete driver, re-install driver, move to different USB port)
369	neg	I put my old razor mouse back in and it works fine
369	neg	So no more Logitech garbage for me
369	neg	I am very pleased that Amazon did refund my money though
369	neg	So kudos to Amazon for the refund
370	pos	Cant say much about this mouse in detail, as I’m not too keen on this like mouse accuracy, DPI, and other things, but if I could guess, I’d say this mouse does those things perfectly fine
370	pos	It has such a massive DPI range for anyone looking to fine tweak it, a G Huh app that can reassign buttons and functions and even change the backlight on your mouse
370	pos	It’s a very stacked mouse, especially when you consider all that you’re getting, people hate the whole wired niche but, I hate having to find new batteries so there’s that lol
370	pos	The build quality and weight is truly what makes this feel like no other
370	pos	It is
370	pos	SO
370	pos	premium, to me
370	pos	It has this metallic feel or maybe plastic, but GOOD plastic and it really feels like what upgrading from a Dualshock 4 to a Dualsense is (if you’re a playstation gamer, you know exactly what I mean) The build quality is an enigma and makes playing in this thing for hours a breeze, truly feels ergonomic
371	pos	The mouse is good, but breaks after a few months
371	pos	If it does break, the hoops Logitech customer service wants you to jump through are ridiculous
371	pos	I have returned enough computer parts for failure and have never had to jump through this many hoops, which include trouble-shooting the mouse yourself (everything from using an air compressor  to uploading new firmware, and more)
371	pos	They also wanted a video of the mouse acting up
371	pos	I have a 4-year warranty and may wait until the factory warranty period is over when it's easier to return
372	neg	please know that I am not sure if this issue is common, I purchased this mouse for my young cousin to play on his computer for Christmas
372	neg	to our surprise he keeps complaining that the left button does not work properly and that it makes a really weird noise
372	neg	I tried to help him and see if I could fix the issue as it is obvious and unfortunately we cant
372	neg	this is unacceptable as this was what my little cousin wanted for his Christmas gift
372	neg	truly feel taken advantage off
373	pos	I have to admit, the fact that there are so many buttons on this mouse made it seem incredibly dumb
373	pos	When would I ever use all of these buttons
373	pos	Well, I still don't but they're not why I like this mouse
373	pos	The scroll wheel is honestly a life changer
373	pos	There's one button on the mouse that changes how the scroll wheel works, switching between normal scrolling and infinite scrolling
373	pos	The latter is definitely beneficial for someone like me who looks at too many spreadsheets every day
373	pos	10/10 product, the size and shape are great and don't feel cheap and my god that scroll wheel
374	pos	its definitely a great buy considering how long my electronics usually last, iv had corsair, razer, roccat, and hyperx
374	pos	I'm no stranger to Logitech considering iv been buying their products for a long time
374	pos	With this mouse iv finished my set of full Logitech peripherals
374	pos	great settings to fit my reactive gaming needs as well as matching aesthetic to my keyboard
374	pos	definitely worth the money
375	neg	This is my second G502 hero
375	neg	The first one lasted almost 2 years
375	neg	I thought maybe I had wore the clicker out
375	neg	or I use it on my laptop and I travel often and it had got damaged on a trip while packing it up
375	neg	So I bought a new one
375	neg	This new one has never left my desk is under a month old up to date on updates tried it on a different computer and can not get it to stop left clicking
375	neg	It is the exact same problem I had with the first g502 hero
375	neg	Will not be getting another one glad it happened before my month was up
376	pos	I was skeptical at first, coming from a Steel Series Rival 600 to this G502
376	pos	But I was shocked to find how comfortable it feels in my hand
376	pos	The weights too are a great feature and easy to install compared to the Rival 600
376	pos	Only thing I would of liked Logitech to change is to have the Logitech hub install when I plug the mouse in
376	pos	It also feels like it doesn't slide well on my mouse pad but I think it is due to being slightly dirty from spilled Redbull LOL
376	pos	This is definitely a good mouse, feels very clean when aiming and very comfy
377	neg	CON # 1: The shape of the this is unusual
377	neg	I do not recommend this mouse if you rest your wrist on a wrist pad because it lifts your palm a little off of the mouse
377	neg	The main point of stable contact on this mouse seems to be the palm
377	neg	The mouse is too narrow to hold the mouse between your thumb and ring and pink fingers
377	neg	Without a wrist pad raising up your wrist this mouse will work okay
377	neg	CON # 2: The scroll wheel is a very smooth metal surface
377	neg	You have to apply a little extra pressure or your finger will just slide on top of the scroll wheel without turning it
377	neg	Logitech's marathon mouse has a nice rubber grip on the scroll wheel; not sure why they didn't use the same here
377	neg	I need a mouse with the free scrolling feature that only some Logitech and Amazon Basics mouses have at this time, but this mouse needs some design fixes in my opinion
378	pos	Love logitech products
378	pos	They're usually top quality and work very well
378	pos	This is a good looking mouse, top quality and works very well
378	pos	The issue I have is that it's heavy
378	pos	Can't imagine anybody Adding additional weight to it
378	pos	If there was a rest for the pinky it can handle additional weight but as is it doesn't
378	pos	The additional weight comes into play when making fine movements with just the fingers
378	pos	Using the mouse using the whole wrist is no problem but split second few pixel adjustment is difficult
378	pos	If this is the only mouse I'm sure people will adjust to it but those who own Mambas, ROGs, wireless charging pad mouse or any other high dollar, very low weight tournament grade mouse will find this mouse too heavy
379	neg	purchased 3/14/2020
379	neg	start noticing left click/drag tends to double click after about 2 months use
379	neg	today is 6/4/2020, problem is more persistent, pretty much will not drag/click hold on left mouse click
379	neg	running latest driver, using Logitech G Hub with profile, mouse cleaned so no dust/derbies inside
379	neg	Decided to google this problem and did what i could based on all reddit/forum advises and nothing helps
379	neg	But one thing is consistent, this problem is a common issue with this mouse and support is minimal from logitech, i have a ticket put in now through their site as they note a "2-year limited hardware warranty" for this product as of 6/3/2020
379	neg	According to some people this issue is due to a "switch" that needs to be replaced/soldered, but if you do this you will void all warranty
379	neg	Just google the problem yourself and decide if this is the right mouse for you
379	neg	I really should've stuck w the razer deathadder instead of trying this out
379	neg	****UPDATE 2/15/2021:currently on my FOURTH replacement from Logitech
379	neg	left click failed on all 3 after about 3-4 month of normal usage, no heavy gaming done
379	neg	essentially, if you click and hold on a double click site that logitech provides for mouse tests for when you report a mouse issue to them, the click counter will keep rising
379	neg	Left click does NOT hold after a few month of usage
379	neg	while my friend recommended this mouse to me and has not had an issue, I'm currently on my FOURTH logitech hero as of yesterday
379	neg	replacement takes 3-4 weeks time and it is tedious
379	neg	I do not recommend and cannot recommend people getting this mouse as this product is EXTREMELY unreliable
380	neg	I do enjoy this mouse, how ever the first one I received the left mouse button wasn't functioning at all
380	neg	Got another one rather quickly
380	neg	This one was great, it did everything I wanted it to and even the extra buttons to setup proper profiles was perfect
380	neg	Now six months after my left mouse button is acting up and likes to unclick it self
380	neg	I really do like this mouse but this is becoming such a headache
380	neg	Update-6/1/21Third mouse I've now received and I got 8 months out of this one instead of the usual six months
380	neg	Now it's an unclicking issue when you hold M1(left mouse button) instead of a double click
381	neg	Purchased this back in March 2020 to replace my about 10 year old Logitech MX518
381	neg	I really did love this mouse at first, the feel, the responsiveness, programable buttons and RGB pairing with the G Pro Keyboard was a nice additional touch
381	neg	I've used the mouse for MMO's and first person shooters alike and loved the performance in both
381	neg	Then came the dreaded click problems, first being noticeable with my right click not sticking when being held down and only registering a single click
381	neg	Second problem came with the left click not registering or semi registering when pairing with the right click, which made this unusable in any FPS game
381	neg	Really disappointed Logitech hasn't addressed this problem and is choosing to ignore it until next product cycle
381	neg	I've been a Logitech peripherals diehard for years, this will be the mouse that ends that
381	neg	I don't want to RMA a mouse every few months to year because the basic feature of clicking stops working
382	pos	It's a real shame, I love this mouse, personally it fits perfectly in my hand and I love the way it feels but after about 6 months of use, the right mouse button started double clicking
382	pos	It was only occasional at first, and sometimes would stop doing it if I clicked the mouse button in a different way, but over the past few weeks it's getting worse and worse
382	pos	I play a fair bit of Rainbow 6 Siege and it's so frustrating to go around a corner to aim at someone's head, only for it to randomly stop aiming and re-aiming sporadically
382	pos	In just this past week now my left mouse button is starting to become unusable, for example I could be using a fully auto weapon and click left mouse button to shoot, only for it to shoot one bullet
382	pos	Even more frustrating is I can't even drag my browsers from one monitor to the other because it just doesn't detect that I'm holding the mouse button down, it acts like I'm only clicking it
382	pos	It just sucks cause I love the way the mouse feels so much but it's just becoming so unusable
383	neg	I'd been a fan of Logitech mice for a long time but these new 500 series are pure garbage
383	neg	I have a 305 and a 402 logitech that I still use on other PCs but I decided I needed a new mouse for my new gaming PC
383	neg	So I bought the 502g despite seeing a lot of flak online for these being basically bricks after a short time of use
383	neg	I trusted that even if the 502g had issues certainly revisions had fixed the issues with double clicking and left click failure that many had reported before
383	neg	It took a mere 3 months of light use on my gaming mouse to become nearly unusable
383	neg	Which I'm sure to an average gamer would be a month or less
383	neg	Don't buy it, you will regret it
383	neg	Listen to the naysayers, the product is just of a purely inferior quality
383	neg	I could have got a cheaper mouse that I know would have been reliable and served my needs but I spurlged because of my respect for Logitech quality and I was let down
383	neg	I will be much more critical of my purchases of logitech mice in the future which sucks because I never even had to think much about it before
384	pos	I like it a lot
384	pos	Ergonomic, easy clicks, scrolls, size, customizable buttons with working software
384	pos	I didn't buy for gaming, only to use for home and work
384	pos	The only drawback is the scroll - it's too loose like what other reviewers said
384	pos	You apply a little force and it scrolls on and on by itself - needs to be tightened a little
384	pos	I'd prefer loose than too tight but still needs tightened a little
385	pos	I’d assumed this would be be similar to my trusty old g602 that finally went to mouse heaven, but it is substantially smaller and lacks the ergonomics of its older brother
385	pos	I trued to make this work for a few months to see if I’d adjust, but I finally caved and bought another 602
385	pos	The quality seems great and the mouse is sleek and responsive
385	pos	It just hurts to use after a long session and my response time was definitely suffering
386	pos	I received an used G502 today and have to say this is the first time this happened to me
386	pos	Please check those pics:It may not that clear to see the linear scratches but it's obvious that the bottom rubber part was peeled off
386	pos	I doubt it was not re-packed well since they were not at the same place when I opened the box
386	pos	I tried my best to shoot those scratches, they are easier to be noticed on real
386	pos	They sent me another replacement even before I return this old one back
386	pos	So I gave 2 more stars for this item
386	pos	I will return the used one back once I received new replacement and make sure it's new
387	pos	Ultimately, I'm very satisfied with this mouse
387	pos	My number one complaint is that the scroll wheel isn't rubberized and is metal, so my fingertip tends to slide on it too easily (especially on cold/dry days)
387	pos	However, I looooove the de-click button
387	pos	That almost makes up for the slippery wheel
387	pos	Ergonomically, it's so-so
387	pos	Feels a little small in my hand and slightly awkward
387	pos	I tend to accidentally click the precision buttons when trying to click primary
387	pos	But all-in-all I'm pretty pleased with it
388	neg	I have used this mouse for about 7 months almost every day for work purposes and/or gaming before it broke down
388	neg	Just like a lot of people have mentioned, it will ultimately result in double click issues (very common)
388	neg	This is when you click left or right button and it registers more than once
388	neg	For example, I may want to highlight something, but while I am holding down the left button, it will register a click again, making it lose the highlight before and highlighting a new one from that instance
388	neg	In addition, this mouse is more suitable for those who do a full grip and have larger hands
388	neg	It is slightly heavier than a normal mouse
388	neg	Regardless, this mouse is great in features such as weight adjustment with several mouse buttons
388	neg	Something to note is that even with all the weights adjustment off, it is still heavier than some of the smaller logitech mouse
388	neg	It is a great mouse, only if you want to buy a new one every year or so
388	neg	It does have a two year warranty, so I am waiting on that
388	neg	Make sure NOT to buy from a 3rd party seller in order to receive the warranty
389	pos	are you right handed
389	pos	do you only need a few buttons on your mouse
389	pos	if yes, this is a great choice for gaming or other usage as well
389	pos	very comfortable for my claw grip
389	pos	the weights let you get exactly the feel you want
389	pos	the sensor is very sensitive and responsive
389	pos	i recommend to use the manufacturer's software utility to set the mouse to hardware memory mode and save your preferred settings there
390	pos	I purchased this after my G700 and it's wired counterpart gave out and I'm pretty disappointed
390	pos	The mouse is on the small side for a gaming mouse
390	pos	With all the weights installed the weight it's OK
390	pos	The scroll wheel has the $10 mouse notchy feel, so bad I'm just using free mode something I never do
390	pos	The button placement is pretty good
390	pos	Even with the lighting off it draws too much power to run off the USB hub in my keyboard, so it needs a powered hub or plugged directly into the PC
390	pos	I will put it this way, I just ordered the parts to rebuild my older gaming mice, just a left mouse button failure on both
390	pos	This will become a backup mouse
391	pos	I love this mouse
391	pos	I doubt that it is for everyone but I purchased two of them
391	pos	One for home, and one for the office
391	pos	This mouse comes with weights and the bottom comes off so you can add them to your liking
391	pos	I only added 2 weights but I could easily see someone else not wanting to add any at all
391	pos	I like a fast mouse but I find that when I have a light-weight mouse it makes it a bit more difficult to be accurate when pointing
391	pos	I didn't expect to like it as much as I do but after using it at home for months I had to get one to use at work because a standard office mouse just isn't cutting it
391	pos	The scroll wheel can be unlocked and can spin freely
391	pos	This is great for scrolling all the way down on a PDF or just getting to the bottom of a page on a website
391	pos	Its far from the most premium feeling mouse but I have to say its definitely not cheap feeling
392	pos	I now own 2 of these and they are without a doubt the best mouse I've ever had
392	pos	The first one I bought is still working nearly 3/4 years later
392	pos	It does have some click issues here and there, but I did travel with it for a couple years without a case
392	pos	New one is just as good
392	pos	Adjustable weight is super dope too
392	pos	This thing goes on sale frequently for like $30 can't beat that buy for the quality
392	pos	1000% recommend
393	pos	I got this mouse and like, it has a METAL SCROLL WHEEL
393	pos	And it feels nice
393	pos	And there's a button to lock or unlock free spin mode
393	pos	Then it has this cool thumb button for changing the DPI to a preset
393	pos	It's a "sniper" button, and if you hold it, and it is set up for a lower DPI preset, you can use it to help aim better when using sniper rifles in games
393	pos	The DPI up, down, and sniper buttons can all be reconfigured anyway if you don't need DPI adjustments
393	pos	And I would not say that any of the buttons are particularly 'in the way'
393	pos	It's a full-sized mouse and good for those with large hands or larger fingers
393	pos	Also the scroll wheel has a left/right tilting click for horizontal scrolling, which you can also remap
394	neg	DO NOT BOTHER WITH LOGITECH WARRANTY
394	neg	They will make you jump through several hoops to "prove" the product is broken then will tell to piss off because "a replacement is not available at this time"
394	neg	I've never been so insulted by a company this much
394	neg	Looks like a really common issue is that the middle mouse button "click" will just break after a month or two of use
394	neg	Kind of an important function when you're gaming
394	neg	EDIT: Tried to get this repaired through Logitech warranty/support and they have been absolutely godawful
394	neg	DO NOT BUY FROM LOGITECH
395	pos	This mouse has weights for you to customize how heavy you would like it
395	pos	There are also customizable buttons for you to program
395	pos	Gaming with this mouse is very smooth and my hand doesn't typically get tired
395	pos	I have small hands (f) so I would prefer the mouse to be a little smaller, but for an average person - and male - this fits great
395	pos	I like that this version is a corded version because I don't need to worry about my mouse dying, but if you prefer wireless this mouse has that option as well
396	pos	Not a fan of Razer mice, or any of their gaming products
396	pos	(I like the Razer phone II)  So I may be biased
396	pos	Hated the Corsair mouse I tried
396	pos	Not sure about the weights, I feel like a good gamer adapts to the gear they have but it has to work, be precise, reliable, durable and feel right
396	pos	Fit and feel, just like a good hand gun
396	pos	Took a day to adjust I think
396	pos	Picked up a second for the office
397	pos	The only thing I can complain about is how the gaming profiles work on this mouse
397	pos	When you only set one profile and disable the other ones, if you press the G9 button (default for switching profiles) nothing should change since there aren't any other profiles but the DPI leds brightness do change to the default value regardless of what brightness level you had before
397	pos	It fixes itself once you open the software and click on the led color tab
397	pos	For this situation happening every time I pressed the G9 button by mistake, I disabled the G9 function and left it blank
398	pos	The scroll wheel placement is about 1
398	pos	5 inches away from the edge of the mouse so my middle finger needs to be bent at all times to utilize it which is actually uncomfortable
398	pos	There isn't enough resistance on the wheel it self and its hard to tell how many tics you go through while scrolling even by feel or sound, this makes it less then ideal for gaming if its hot keyed and this is a gaming mouse
398	pos	and to push the scroll wheel down for an additional hotkey function, it doesn't plunge downward enough for my liking
398	pos	I would not recommend using this as a gaming mouse but it would be decent at best for everyday use
398	pos	If you have large to xl hands this is not for you
399	neg	This mouse is way way to complicated to use and frankly don't have the time nor do I want to spend the time deciphering how to use this damn thing
399	neg	The buttons are all too close together so when you are playing anything you will be sure to change the DPI mid game and lose it
399	neg	The sell this as a gaming mouse yet you cant play anything more than 5 minutes without accidently changing the DPI setting to some ridiculous speed
399	neg	Tried downloading and installing the software and it fails too
399	neg	Just trash
399	neg	I wish product designers would realize that people do not live in your world and look at these things all day long
399	neg	Don't expect people to just know how to use a product that is so complicated and has a horrible user manual
399	neg	I pay good money for a premium product I cant even enjoy because it takes a college course to learn how to use
400	pos	I was rocking a madcatz R
400	pos	A
400	pos	T 7 forever, till my cat got the mouse
400	pos	literally
400	pos	Chewed through the cable and I’m pretty sure the don’t make those mice anymore
400	pos	So I opted for the Logitech, it’s a great mouse, almost similar to my old one but different button layout
400	pos	So I’m still getting used to it here about 2 months later
400	pos	But it’s a great mouse, I love the free spin selection on the mouse wheel
400	pos	That thing spins forever and a day
400	pos	Anyways, it’s a great gaming mouse
400	pos	I use it in Dayz all the time as well as elite dangerous
401	neg	I have had this mouse for 6 months and for the first 4ish months it was a great mouse
401	neg	I love the buttons and that it fits my hand great (which is hard because I have smaller hands) but about 2 months ago the left click started acting up
401	neg	I can't highlight text or move windows, I try to close one internet window and end up closing multiples all because no matter how lightly or quickly I push the left click it ALWAYS double clicks
401	neg	This mouse should have lasted a hell of a lot longer than 6 months, specially with how much it costs
401	neg	I'll be going out today to buy a new one and will definitely avoid getting another Logitech
402	pos	While I was getting a list of keyboards from the very helpful Logitech people, I asked about programmable mice
402	pos	They recommended the G502 Hero and the G502 Lightspeed
402	pos	I went with the G502 Hero
402	pos	I am not sorry that I did
402	pos	It is a very nice mouse
402	pos	The only thing I am still not sure about is if I should have gone with the wireless Lightspeed model
402	pos	That is the difference between the two mice
402	pos	I have the corded model
402	pos	I wanted to avoid any connection problems
402	pos	So, this mouse is well made and nice to hold
402	pos	The buttons are placed well for average hands
402	pos	I cant fault them for my hands, as I have unusually large hands and fingers (my ring sizes are in the 20's and 30's)
402	pos	I am used to having this problem with all mice however
402	pos	It is one reason I like the trackpad, but trackpad's are not good for gaming
402	pos	I really must say how much I like the G Hub software, it really works well with MacOS, knock on wood
402	pos	Let's hope it continues to do so
402	pos	They really have the competition beat by miles, it just works so smoothly with MacOS
402	pos	Oh yes
402	pos	The weights
402	pos	I thought these were just a gimmick when I read about them
402	pos	I stand corrected, they completely change the feel of the mouse
402	pos	I have decided I like all the weights loaded, it has a good solid feel that way
402	pos	Highly recommended
403	pos	the value you can get from it is great
403	pos	unfortunately most of the buttons aren't recognizeable by the pc, you have to give most of the mouse buttons a input while use, my advice is using the numpad keys
403	pos	the mouse is not Ergonomic build well, if you have meduim to large hands two of your fingers would be on the pad/table or in the air by force it
403	pos	in the pictures that looks a wide mouse but it was built like that you can't fit your whole hand with it
403	pos	a bit disapointing, but still overall good with my purchase on sale for that mouse, mostly because of the features and quality built
404	pos	Not for large hands
404	pos	Way too many accidental right clicks when side to side aiming
404	pos	even just web browsing on ytube
404	pos	Logitech g602 with the thumb wing for life
404	pos	This is a great mouse, but il be tossing it in the drawer
404	pos	I added all the weights, but I'm still too jittery and jerky with aiming when compared to the g602
404	pos	The weight of my fingers is enough to depress right click
404	pos	Look somewhere else unless it's for a kid
405	neg	The product page advertises 25,000 DPI but the product delivered clearly says it only gets up to 16,000 DPI
405	neg	I’ll update my review after a few months of use but the 2 star review will stay until then for false advertising
405	neg	I saw what looked like the same mouse at Target at the same price but because of the drastic difference in DPI I assumed it must have been an earlier model and ordered and waited for this product to arrive instead
405	neg	Slimy business practice
405	neg	I’m pretty disappointed
406	pos	It's of course a great gaming mouse and it's hard to go wrong with this mouse
406	pos	The ergonomics are almost perfect for my hand
406	pos	The only issue holding it back from a 5 star review is material quality
406	pos	Compared to my old mouse it feels cheap
406	pos	Granted it is about 15 bucks cheaper but still I would have liked to see better quality
406	pos	It also doesn't slide as smoothly on my mouse pad and it has thrown me off to a small degree
406	pos	Just my subjective opinion though
406	pos	I'm also not a big fan of the software
407	neg	In total it had been a great mouse for the price
407	neg	But the reason this is a low star review is because the when the mouse feet on my unit came off and the sensor started randomly flicking upward
407	neg	I emailed Logitech about this back and forth waiting days at a time for each responce they sent, continuously kept asking for more details after I had explained everything
407	neg	Also I called the support number and waited for hours at a time for no one to answer
407	neg	In total this was a waste of the money I spent on it, and I cant even take advantage of my warranty
408	pos	I got this mouse because it was recommended for large hands
408	pos	It's too small for my borderline medium to large hands
408	pos	The claw grip looks comical and the palm grip puts my thumb on the sniper button
408	pos	For me, there is simply no good way to hold it and have decent control
408	pos	I gave it 4 stars because it's of a high build quality and the sensor tracks great
408	pos	I won't be able to use it because of the size and I don't recommend anyone with large size or bigger hands to get this mouse
409	pos	I had just entered the PC world and was playing on a basic Logitech mouse
409	pos	Didn't take long to realize I needed to upgrade
409	pos	Overall,l this is a very solid step up
409	pos	From the numerous customizable buttons, weight variation, and RGB lighting, your mouse will look good, feel good, and play good
409	pos	For my personal playing style, the weight adjustment is the best feature
409	pos	Some like a lighter mouse but I like mine a little heavier
409	pos	The weights under the mouse made making the adjustment to my liking quite seamless
409	pos	The RGB lighting is not the best
409	pos	There are plenty of mouse options that offer cooler-looking light functions, but for something that is just cosmetic, it was not a deal-breaker
409	pos	Overall, the RGB is no bad at all, it's just not great
409	pos	I give this mouse a solid 9 out of 10
409	pos	I would have liked the weights to be just a little heavier, and the RGB to be more intriguing but for the simple task of gaming, the mouse is great
410	pos	I had a Razer Naga that had a good life, but after about 10 years, it was having some issues
410	pos	Before I had that mouse, I recall the Logitech I had and loved the scroll feature it had
410	pos	A friend of mine said that it was the best mouse for playing Spore due to going from planetary to galactic in an instant
410	pos	Now that I’m back in school and using digital books, I felt the need for that scroll wheel
410	pos	I still wanted extra buttons, but realized I didn’t need the num-pad on my thumb
410	pos	This mouse checked all those boxes, and for a good price
410	pos	Additionally, there is a button on the mouse that lets you switch how the scroll works, which is nice at time
411	neg	I’ve owned multiple gaming mouses from different brands, and I’ve never felt so uncomfortable using this mouse
411	neg	The scroll wheel doesn’t feel accurate/natural
411	neg	There are two buttons on the left mouse button, while this could be super convenient for someone that needs them, I don’t
411	neg	I feel like there is very little wiggle room for my finger and it’s too easy to misclick things
411	neg	I’ve tried to use it for a week or so and get used to it, but this mouse just not feel natural to use for me
412	neg	The mouse worked fine for approximately one month before it suddenly stopped functioning
412	neg	I tried different computers and settings, all to no avail
412	neg	I contacted Logitech support and they asked me to change a number of settings on my computer, none of which worked
412	neg	The mouse was dead
412	neg	I was asked to send a photo of the serial number and mouse, etc
412	neg	to them
412	neg	Several days passed and I was sent a response from a different customer support person basically telling me to repeat the steps and again send in the photos
412	neg	One week later, same thing, different person
412	neg	Back and forth emails were getting nowhere
412	neg	Finally, another person said that the warranty replacement was being processed and I would hear back from them within 72 hours
412	neg	That was one month ago
412	neg	As you can see, “customer support” is code for stalling until the customer gets fed up and stops trying
412	neg	Kudos to Erma M
412	neg	, Mel C
412	neg	, Rhon Garcia in customer support for their attempt to save Logitech a couple of bucks at the expense of customer satisfaction
412	neg	My family has used multiple Logitech mice in the past
412	neg	Good luck with that now
413	neg	So i recommend to any user that reads a happy 4/5 star review of this mouse, either is by a user who doesn't play games or reviewed the mouse to early
413	neg	This mouse has double click issues within less than 1 year time frame typically
413	neg	The switch is poor quality
413	neg	i highly recommend looking into a the new viper optic switch though the mouse material looks like crap
413	neg	Anyway other comments, when i tried to RMA this product if that's what your thinking you'll do when this fails
413	neg	well they might do it for u after you take a full spread video of u clicking the mouse on this stupid html page for double click issues
413	neg	Personally i'm not going to do that when u look at several reviews of this product and every user out there that has this mouse for any time has terrible issues with this product
413	neg	Material/shape of mouse and weight options are good
413	neg	overall colors and coolness factor great, drivers were meh
413	neg	Logtiech click quality is the problem with this mouse
413	neg	I've had my wireless MX series for 3 years still don't have this issue
413	neg	Anyway good luck if u decide to buy and actually regularly game
414	pos	Luego de que se descomponga un G700s (funcionó desde el 2013-2020) he pasado por muchos, pero muchos experimentos
414	pos	marcas y modelos, de palma, de garra, con peso y sin el
414	pos	hasta que finalmente dí con éste modelo, que el tiempo me dirá si es igualmente duradero como el modelo reemplazado
414	pos	Es ergonómico y cómodo
414	pos	Me ha gustado tanto la ergonomía que he comprado otro para tenerlo de reserva en el caso que se deje de fabricar
415	pos	I originally bought one of these back in 2014-2015, when it had no RGB, only a single blue light, and the blue strip on the bottom left where your thumb rests
415	pos	Had it under warranty through Microcenter and switched it out for the Spectrum edition, with the RGB around 2016-2017
415	pos	Recently bought this Hero back in February of this year, just in case
415	pos	Glad I did, since it seems my older one is starting to develop a double-click on the right click
415	pos	Since using the new one now, I can definitely tell the old one had more wear and tear obviously, with a more loose scroll wheel
415	pos	But wow, a mouse you pay 50-60 USD for that lasts you that long
415	pos	I'll never use any other mouse honestly
415	pos	The scroll wheel feature alone is hands down what makes this mouse better than any other mouse
415	pos	Every other good feature, the sensor, the 4 profiles, on-board memory, good cable, etc are just bonuses stacked on top of each other
416	neg	I bought this mouse to replace a $15 chinese mouse that worked perfectly for 3 years
416	neg	In less than 3 months I started having problems with the left mouse button randomly double clicking and not being able to click something and drag it without dropping it
416	neg	5 minutes of research on the internet and I find that many are having the same problem because they got faulty switches and used them anyway, selling them 50% off to lure people into the trap
416	neg	This product was a horrible purchase, and has eroded many years of trust I had in Logitech products
417	neg	They look great, they feel great and I have no complaints on how they respond when they work
417	neg	But every single one of them breaks after 6-10 months and all have the same problem
417	neg	The left-click either double-clicks or just acts as you depresses the button (you can notice this during drag-and-drops, when the click is released half-way)
417	neg	This is the last Logitech mouse I will spend the money on, and I have owned pretty much all generations of multi-button mice
417	neg	While CS will most likely send me a replacement for the mouse, since it is in warranty, I find it to be too much of a hassle to have to keep RMAing them
417	neg	This is a mouse that was purchased in Nov of 2019 and broke in Apr of 2020
417	neg	UPDATE 7/28/20: The mousse that was shipped to me as a replacement (received on 5/15), started doing the exact same thing with releasing the held button on its own
417	neg	This mouse lasted 2
417	neg	5 months before going bad
417	neg	At this point, I will stay away from any Logitech mice as they seem to not be really lasting long anymore
417	neg	It is just a waste of money and time
418	pos	The mouse is great quality, I love the weights you can add or remove from the bottom
418	pos	I love logitech period
418	pos	Here's the problem though and why I gave it 3 stars
418	pos	There's two DPI sensitivity buttons next to your left mouse button
418	pos	I mostly play shooters and I understand that this idea was probably meant for quick switching DPI and it's a great idea
418	pos	But I think it failed in execution, I found myself accidentally clicking both these buttons just trying to aim down sights and shoot and then my camera would freak out and I would die
418	pos	The simple solution is to unbind both these keys so that they do nothing and that works but at the same time they're just annoying being there
418	pos	The mouse is too small for my hand, if you have a big hand you'll find that you have a difficult time gripping this thing like I do
418	pos	(Length and width wise it's too small for me) There's a sniper button next to your left thumb, and yet again another great idea but that happens to be where I like to grip my mouse and I find myself clicking that button on accidentally constantly
418	pos	All in all great mouse for people with small hands
418	pos	Great ideas, but poorly executed on all the extra buttons
419	neg	I was really disappointed with the design of the scroll wheel
419	neg	Why anyone would give this mouse more than one star is beyond me
419	neg	You can't use a light touch of your finger to move the scroll wheel, either when using the wheel as the third button or trying to scroll with it
419	neg	You have to mash down hard with your index finger (or thumb) in order to use it as your third button, and you have to mash down and push hard with your index finger to turn the wheel (when not in free-spin mode)
419	neg	Oh well, back to my $10 Microsoft mouse
420	neg	Unfortunately, this mouse does not respect mouse sensitivity customization correctly
420	neg	The default setting for this mouse is incredibly sensitive, and hard to work with
420	neg	Logitech Hub supports the ability to change said sensitivity, unfortunately, every time a user logs off / in to the computer, or restarts the computer, the sensitivity settings are not respected, and I am forced to manually go back into the Hub, and shift the sensitivity a tiny bit (and then back), so that the driver is able to once again pick up the setting I wanted
420	neg	After searching for solutions to the this on DuckDuckGo, I see that others have had similar problems for over a year, and there does not appear to be any solution
420	neg	Even though I have had success with other Logitech products, I regret buying this mouse from them
421	neg	It was an incredible gaming mouse however out of all the mice I've ever owned this one I have been the most gentle with and it is the only mouse that has ever broke on me, it's had the least amount of use and abuse put of the tons I've owned
421	neg	The problem is that after some time lmb starts to lose its ability to detect touch, clicking and dragging stopped working, it would unclick itself and then re click itself as I held down
421	neg	This also sometimes led to double clicks if I clicked something and held my finger down between
421	neg	5-1sec
421	neg	This
421	neg	makes it entirely un-useable as a gaming mouse and anything more than web surfing, cannot drag files anymore or anything
421	neg	Talked to one of my friends and they had a similar issue
421	neg	Not sure if I'll buy another one or get a razer one instead but a lifespan of 1-2 years (warranty only covers 1 year) makes sense now
422	pos	I love the L/R click switches very responsive without much force, and the G hub customization options with profiles migrated from Logitech gaming software app
422	pos	The cord is very long and braided that's a plus, and the sensor is very much a upgrade from my G602
422	pos	I like the unlockable scroll wheel a very cool feature along with the dpi shift
422	pos	Great option with added weights for your preference
422	pos	I highly recommend especially at the price it is right now its pretty unbeatable
423	pos	Was using a G602 I got from a friend prior to buying this
423	pos	I had been looking into a wired mouse for a while now and decided that this was the best one to get
423	pos	Got it about a week early and once I started using it, I realized just how much of a difference 2000 to 4000 dpi can make
423	pos	I immediately became better at any shooting game I played and the mouse didn't lag at all as a plus
423	pos	The design is great and has a great feel on my hand
423	pos	The RGB is also a nice touch to go with the rest of my set up
423	pos	Would highly recommend
424	neg	Wished i could of use this mouse it seams very nice
424	neg	However the thumb clicks on the side is very very low so when a grab the mouse my thumb is resting on the side buttons and it makes it unusable for me since while gaming i am hitting one of this buttons and causing to cancel of what im doing and do what i have assign on it
424	neg	Wish the side thumb buttons were a bit higher up
425	neg	The physical mouse itself is very nice
425	neg	Fits well in my hand, comfortable to use, nice button placement for the most part
425	neg	However, I had a ton of issues with this mouse cycling profile, switching to onboard memory, randomly disconnecting, forgetting bindings and reverting to default settings mid game
425	neg	I uninstalled and reinstalled drivers and the Logitech software
425	neg	I tired it on different USB ports and different computers
425	neg	Nothing fixed the issues
425	neg	I was about to return the mouse and try a different product and manufacturer all together despite really liking the physical product
425	neg	Then I found out that there are two different Logitech platforms that can be used to configure Logitech peripherals: GHub and Logitech Gaming Software
425	neg	I had been using GHub initially
425	neg	At the advice of a random internet stranger, I uninstalled GHub and installed the alternative Logitech Gaming Software (LGS)
425	neg	Mouse works great now
425	neg	No issues whatsoever
425	neg	The experience left me with pretty mixed feelings overall
425	neg	I'd say the mouse would probably get a 4/5 star with the LGS software
425	neg	The button placement of the back/forward could be a little further forward or adjustable, but I have slightly larger than average hands
425	neg	For most this would probably be a non-issue
425	neg	The GHub software brings my rating down to the 2/5 star
426	pos	Bought this mouse about a year ago and recently ran into the issue of it clicking repeatedly as opposed to holding down the left mouse button
426	pos	Small problem that creates quite a bit of frustration
426	pos	Mouse held up for a year and wasn't abused in any way and just slowly got worse
426	pos	Bought mine for $50 if I remember correctly, so I'd say I got my money's worth out of it, but still disappointed in it
426	pos	I had a cheap $20 mouse that lasted 4 years *after* I super-glued the plastic part of the LMB back onto it after a decent amount of abuse and never ran into issues that impacted game-play or work
426	pos	TL;DR - Got about a year out of the mouse before it started to break without rigorous use
427	neg	Over my years of gaming and just general pc use i have never had a issue with Logitech but this mouse is horrible
427	neg	It doesn't click everytime or if your holding both down to walk lets say in WoW it stops walking and a pain to get get moving again
427	neg	I was never worried about logitech products but i am buyer beware now
427	neg	UpdateWell all i can say is the G502 Hero i bought didn't even last 5 months
427	neg	It made WoW unbearable to play
427	neg	When you hold both clicks down, instead of running all i get is a step and stop
427	neg	If you play WoW you know that's a death sentence when you can't get out of the stuff you're standing in
427	neg	I wish i would have read all the reviews before purchasing the G502 Hero , there is definitely a Real problem with it
427	neg	Now that i bought the Razer Ballistic V2 no issues whatsoever  , but i do miss the weight of the G502 Hero
428	neg	I bought this mouse after a previous Logitech gaming mouse's wheel broke
428	neg	The previous mouse lasted me 5 years, which was way beyond what I could've asked
428	neg	This one lasted 6 months
428	neg	The good: the ergonomics are great and the mouse manages to fit my monster-sized hands
428	neg	I love the tune-able weights
428	neg	The laser is quality and what I expect from Logitech's gaming offerings
428	neg	The wheel's free-spin mode is awesome
428	neg	The bad: After 6 months, the mouse doesn't generate a steady "click-and-hold" signal anymore, and sometimes a single click generates several rapid clicks instead
428	neg	I can work around the multi-click issue in OS settings, but there is nothing that can solve the spotty "click-and-hold" signal besides pressing the button down with a vice-like deathgrip, which surely worsens the underlying hardware problem
428	neg	Now, I am rarely able to successfully click-and-drag something
428	neg	Beyond frustrating for the asking price
428	neg	The problem is intermittent, though - when I wrote to Logitech's support about it I could no longer reproduce the issue and my ticket was closed
428	neg	I should mention that support wants fairly herculean effort on the part of the user to demonstrate to them that you have an issue, which felt insulting considering the sheer volume of Logi products I use and have recommended to friends and colleagues
428	neg	Seems to me that the switches being used in Logitech's mice may now be cheaper than what I'm accustomed to
428	neg	Probably going to buy from a new brand, now
429	pos	This is the most comfortable mouse I've ever held
429	pos	The mouse itself is a little on the heavier side but it's perfect for me even without the extra weights
429	pos	The extra weights are a really nice touch
429	pos	The mouse is beautiful the rgb in the G can be changed to any color on the colorwheel, sniper button is a really good thing to have when gaming, I need to get used to using it though
429	pos	The dpi buttons are set up in a good place, easy to reach when needed
429	pos	The app is easy to use to set up all the defaults, though some things are a bit confusing
429	pos	Overall an amazing mouse, couldn't have asked for better
430	neg	The mouse is an awesome looking mouse that has a lot of customizability
430	neg	I bought my first one back in Aug of 2019 and it was great
430	neg	for about 6 months
430	neg	That's when I noticed an issue with the way the mouse clicks and drags
430	neg	First the left button would double click, then the right button wouldn't maintain a constant click
430	neg	(i
430	neg	e
430	neg	when you hold it down
430	neg	) So I filed my first support ticket
430	neg	They sent me a replacement in about 3 weeks
430	neg	I then bought one for my GF thinking that it was a one off issue
430	neg	About 4 months of using the replacement I got another issue with both buttons AGAIN
430	neg	Ok I thought, another support ticket
430	neg	They again sent me a replacement
430	neg	My friend asks for a mouse recommendation and I tell him "If you get my mouse 'it works when it works
430	neg	'" He goes out to buy it
430	neg	I might be VERY unlucky, but it's gotten to the point where I have to say something about it
430	neg	My 2nd Replacement Is again doing the double clicking
430	neg	My GFs mouse is also double clicking, as well as my friends mouse
430	neg	This mouse is a TEMPORARY mouse
430	neg	It will not last more than 6 months without issues
430	neg	If you can pick it up for about 20$ then it's worth it, but for the 60$ I originally paid for it
430	neg	No way
430	neg	I might be unlucky, but 100% of the Hero 502 mice I seen, all 5, start double clicking within 6 months
431	pos	On my mac, this mouse would suddenly skip to high resolution all by itself, making the cursor zoom around the screen
431	pos	Also, I had to program the "back" button for internet browsing, but after awhile it would suddenly "forget" the setting and I would have to reload the config program again to reset it
431	pos	It was so frustrating I finally stopped using it
432	pos	This is actually our third purchase of this model
432	pos	We have one at each computer and this order was to replace one of the very first released models for this brand
432	pos	Not because it stopped working either, just cause the cable was looking a little gnarly over the past 7 years and I wanted it to be nice and smooth
432	pos	We stored the old mouse in the new box to use if any of our current give out, but I don't see that happening any time soon
433	neg	As others have seen, this mouse will give you click/double-click issues after normal use in about 12 months
433	neg	It is VERY frustrating, you will double-click unintentionally due to hardware defects in this mouse
433	neg	You will also be unable to click/drag
433	neg	The mouse will do unintentional actions which are difficult to undo
433	neg	I am scrapping the mouse since it's "limited" warranty is expired
433	neg	Very disappointing from Logitech
433	neg	DO NOT BUY this mouse
434	pos	Previous mouse was a Razer Mamba Wired
434	pos	This mouse has a specific button near the thumb to reduce the DPI to the lowest setting only while your thumb is pressing it, thus dubbing it the 'sniper button'
434	pos	I am usually at 1000 dpi while playing but with the scope + the sniper button it lets me dial in
434	pos	Something I've never had on a mouse
434	pos	Took me a couple days to get used to the new button layout, as I have been using the Razer Mamba for about 9 months now
434	pos	I can add weights, making it feel more solid
434	pos	I can already tell this mouse is going to be amazing, just also switched to the Logitech G533 too from the Razer Kraken as a larger overall switch from Razer to Logitech (Price and Quality is simply more worth it with Logitech as in the same price will get you more quality with Logitech)
434	pos	Also the scroll wheel release button is SUPER unique; lets the scroll wheel fly
434	pos	Watch some YouTube Videos to make sure your familiar but for 50$ its a mouse worth buying 100%
435	neg	I bought this mouse to replace one with a button1 click issue
435	neg	double clicking, wouldn't keep the button active while holding it firmly down
435	neg	And guess what
435	neg	this mouse started doing the same thing after 5
435	neg	5 months
435	neg	random loss of button one while holding/dragging
435	neg	I used the computer much of the day, every day, but I'm sure I didn't press the button 2 million times in 5 months
435	neg	Well, relatively sure
435	neg	:) I was too lazy to return, just really disappointed, and it's past 1 year
435	neg	Might check out other brands
435	neg	I really miss the super smooth control resolution
435	neg	Very ergonomic and comfortable
435	neg	just couldn't do the main function of a basic mouse, KEEPING THE MAIN BUTTON PRESSED
436	pos	The mouse has a great feel to it and with the adjustable weights can be made to feel even better
436	pos	The software for programming the buttons is hot garbage and renders the extra buttons useless
436	pos	The initial software install has it all working great but once you reboot your pc the software can no longer find the mouse
436	pos	It just sits there asking for you to identify the mouse while the mouse is plugged in and you're waiting to get back into your game
436	pos	If they can ever fix the software this would be a terrific mouse
436	pos	PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY BECAUSE THE GHUB SOFTWARE THAT PROGRAMS THE BUTTONS IS HOT GARBAGE
436	pos	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
436	pos	>UPDATE<
436	pos	The Ghub Software has been fixed and updated, making this mouse extremely worthwhile
436	pos	If you ever needed a great mouse or a new replacement mouse THIS IS THE ONE
437	pos	In short, I am right handed if you look to the left of this mouse it is curved in wards on the left (for my thumb
437	pos	) and leaves nothing for my pinky to rest on so it drags across the mouse pad while I'm playing
437	pos	I wish the curved in part was on the right for me and my thumb wouldn't drag either way
437	pos	Also, I have to like bring my fingers inward to play my fingers and palm isn't fit to lay across this mouse fully (my hands aren't even big)
437	pos	It's fine for now but the flaws will lead me to purchasing a different mouse when this one breaks
437	pos	Has plenty of positives and loads of features to make up for it but when you're spending over 60 bucks on a mouse for having fun why compromise there are other options
438	pos	I have mobility issues, and am an author and digital artists, and spend ninety percent of my waking hours at the computer
438	pos	This is my second Logitech G502 HERO, having worn out my previous one after years of constant use (The wheel slowly gave up
438	pos	) I pair it with a das keyboard mechanical, and between the two I couldn't be happier concerning response and quality
438	pos	I sound like  62yo fanboy, but I began on the forefront of PC's, and you probably don't understand the pain of the early, crap pointer devices
439	pos	The key features to note about this product that may make this the wrong choice for you are as follows:1
439	pos	) The odd shape and size of the mouse
439	pos	This mouse is quite large and has a contour on the right side that can cause your hand to slide off
439	pos	I personally like the size because I have medium size hands but like to rest my palm far back on the mouse with a palm grip
439	pos	I don't care for the contour however because it causes my hand to slide to that side and doesn't support my fingers over there
439	pos	That can cause my thumb to rub up against the buttons on the right side uncomfortably
439	pos	2
439	pos	) The buttons on this mouse are somewhat looser than your standard mouse
439	pos	By this I mean they have less resistance to pressing and tend to wiggle more
439	pos	This mainly applies to the two main mouse buttons and the scroll wheel
439	pos	I'm used to using mice like this, but for those who aren't it can take some adjusting to get used to it
439	pos	3
439	pos	) Another concern is (although it may not be the case in every mouse) the build quality
439	pos	When I originally received my mouse, the left mouse button was setting slightly lower than the other buttons
439	pos	This doesn't cause a functionality issue, but it causes my index finger to rub up along the ridge in between the dpi buttons and the left mouse button
439	pos	There are plenty of great features I noticed about this product, but I thought I would point out some of the features that aren't necessarily bad but may turn some people away
439	pos	Update after about 8 months of use:The pads at the bottom of the mouse tend to slide around a little bit which causes the resin that holds them to the bottom of the mouse to come out from under the pads
439	pos	This is annoying because it tends to get on my mouse pad and also collects a lot of dust around the pad (which is hard to clean) where the resin is exposed
440	pos	This is my second G502
440	pos	The reason this is my second is the middle button (scroll wheel button) does not work anymore
440	pos	I don't really use the button too much so I dont know if it was wear-and-tear or a defect
440	pos	In any case the over all mouse is excellent
440	pos	'Can Confirm'  The middle (wheel) button is not good
440	pos	As I said this is my second mouse and this one too has similar issue with the middle mouse button
440	pos	The side buttons have become overly sensitive
440	pos	when I click the button down it activates the side buttons
440	pos	Not a good thing when you are in the middle of an intense one-v-one, or just trying to perform one action and another action happens
440	pos	:(
441	pos	Everyone who loves FPS games know that this mouse is at the top of the food chain
441	pos	It’s hard to beat a G502
441	pos	I have gone through 3 of these
441	pos	Not because of mouse failure but because of anger management failure
441	pos	Anyway, The weight adjustment is very nice, people complain about the software, I’ve come to like it with the updates
441	pos	It not exactly user friendly, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll realize how in depth Logitech has gone to give you as much customization as possible
441	pos	The response time is almost unmatched
441	pos	I have bigger hands, and at times the mouse does feel a little on the small side, but the button placement for side buttons is perfect, the metal scroll wheel is one of my favorite features
441	pos	The overall design is very sleek with a gamer focused appeal
441	pos	If you’re on the edge, prices for this mouse have gone down at the time of writing this it’s only $40, which is an incredible value for what you get in this mouse
441	pos	Even @$50 I’ll still buy another one if I break my now 3rd one
441	pos	Lol
442	neg	I understand the hype, but the scroll wheel is atrocious
442	neg	If you middle click you also activate one of the middle left/right scroll buttons
442	neg	The free wheel is ok but the tactile wheel feels bad
442	neg	This mouse would be a 5 star from me, but I had to return it because of the wheel
442	neg	Also you can’t fully program a bunch of features on the mouse’s memory
442	neg	You need the app to rebind specific keys like shift, ctrl, and alt
442	neg	Not a deal breaker, but kinda lame
443	pos	It's the most popular for a reason
443	pos	After owning a cheap red dragon and a quite nice Corsair mouse I tried my friends 502 while staying with him and was instantly in love
443	pos	It's lightweight, the ergonomics just feel right and the button placement is fantastic
443	pos	The software has it's quirks but it allows you to remap and create macros for games even if they don't like you remap, it's great
443	pos	In the grand scheme it's a pretty cheap mouse for how great it is, would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good mouse
444	pos	This is my go to mouse for my FPS games
444	pos	Combining this with a gaming keypad allows my gaming to improve
444	pos	The software to modify DPI is a bit confusing but once you get the hang of it, it works well
444	pos	You can change the DPI on the fly during a game
444	pos	The software also let's you reassign the different buttons
444	pos	Very useful
444	pos	Newer versions of this mouse has a better cable that doesn't kink as much as the older versions
444	pos	It is sturdy enough for many years of play without breaking down
445	neg	All the things are great
445	neg	Buttons, weights, everything
445	neg	I loved this mouse, and told many people about it
445	neg	I had a Razor before this
445	neg	For $50 in 2008, the Razor lasted me 11 years
445	neg	This mouse here, the "Hero", lasted not even a year and a half
445	neg	The left button, the most important button, screws up all the time
445	neg	I can't even click and drag
445	neg	Apparently, this is an issue with this mouse in particular
445	neg	Look it up before you buy it, it wouldn't hurt
446	pos	If you want a mouse that isnt too loaded with too many buttons or wont cramp your hand then this one might just be for you
446	pos	I've used the original g502 for years, recently bought this  'Hero' version and I can say it still holds up just as great
446	pos	I'm not big on my computer mouse having too many buttons and love this one for that
446	pos	It's not a big mouse either
446	pos	Fits perfectly in the palm of my hand
446	pos	My old one lasted me years, it's still not broken, I just decided it was time to get a new one
446	pos	I had originally bought a Corsair mouse but that thing was too big and was cramping my hand
446	pos	This one does not do that
446	pos	Love it very much and I'll buy it again if I ever need another
447	pos	This is my second G502 after the first one developed a double click issue in the left mouse button after 3-4 years of daily use
447	pos	Overall I'm happy with the performance and given that I use this as my daily mouse for work, I'm okay with it developing issues after 3+ years of constant use
447	pos	The mouse glides very smoothly and the included weights allow you to fine-tune how you like your mouse to feel
447	pos	The mouse comes with plenty of buttons and the Logitech software makes it very easy to customize what they do
447	pos	The RGB lights add some good looks although I typically have it turned off
448	pos	With only a slight negative rating on ergonomics due to the wrist / fingers bending awkwardly to reach certain buttons, this is still the best all around gaming mouse on the market
448	pos	I do digital design (photoshop, Affinity, AutoCAD), and number of programmable buttons is extremely important to cut down on moving pointer back and forth to the toolbar
448	pos	I haven't found another mouse that accomplishes this, with no lag, as well as the G502
448	pos	The inclusion of optional weights for prevention of jitters and shakes of the hand is a welcome addition
449	pos	Given the shape, I find it kind of hard to sit my hand on it naturally in a way that can reach all the buttons
449	pos	I have to sit my hand way far forward to be able to reach everything
449	pos	Other then that it seems to work great
449	pos	On my personal computer the software is nice and seems to work well, on my work computer where I can't install software there are some things that I cannot adjust (RGB), but not a big deal
449	pos	Overall seems like a pretty nice wired mouse
450	neg	Ergonomically superior and well sized for large hands, this mouse feels premium in the palm
450	neg	Initially the mouse performed with unsurpassed accuracy, however, as time went on, intermittent switch failure in the left and right click switches began to occur
450	neg	My first 502 Hero lasted a little over a year in the demanding Division 2 environment
450	neg	Another problem I experienced occurred with on-the-fly DPI switching; DPI would increase just fine, however the return to lower, more controllable DPI settings had to be reset outside the application
450	neg	I received my first 502 Hero as a gift
450	neg	last Christmas (2019)  I purchased a replacement (this order) which arrived DOA, no lights, no action
450	neg	I have been using Logitech products for close to 22 years
450	neg	My original G5 laser gaming mouse, which released in late 2005, is still my backup device
450	neg	Logitech quality has suffered in the past 5 years
450	neg	For the record this review is of the product and not of Amazon's service
450	neg	Amazon has taken care of my needs beyond my expectations, even offering to send me a replacement prior to receiving the RMA of this item
451	pos	I'll start by saying that I'm a huge Logitech nerd
451	pos	I love everything they sell
451	pos	Quality products that look good, feel good, and work good
451	pos	I bought this mouse to replace my G402
451	pos	The G502 Hero looks nicer
451	pos	Has synching LEDs that can be paired with other Logitech gear and there is a neat magnetic panel underneath where the weights go
451	pos	I used all of the weights because it seems more accurate with precise movement
451	pos	The only thing I dont like is that the profiles can be switched on the mouse with a button, colors and all (which is very cool
451	pos	) But that also drastically changes the DPI with every profile unless you change them all to the same DPI manually
451	pos	This seems pointless because there are already 2 DPI buttons on the mouse
452	pos	This is noticeably better than my G500 that I upgraded from
452	pos	Could have been age of hardware or software degrading the old G500, but either way this is clearly superior and the LED effects are awesome
452	pos	I liked the idea of extra buttons on the G502 and they seem all reachable
452	pos	Also seems to be mechanical improvement to DPI setting buttons, which you can reprogram per game if you want
452	pos	So far, this has been a really nice upgrade
452	pos	The game moves exactly where I put the cursor in a way I can't explain other than "tracking" being excellent
453	pos	I love so much about this mouse
453	pos	The weights are probably my favorite part, being able to adjust that per game and need is amazing
453	pos	I do wish I had one-two more (max no more please) buttons on the side for tying to macros and what have you, but this is an excellent mouse without breaking the bank
453	pos	I love the ability to have rough or loose scrolling on the wheel
453	pos	Easy to clean too (games, clean yo dang mice, human hands be gross
453	pos	)
454	neg	Mouse worked fine for a couple of months
454	neg	Then would randomly stop registering mouse1 as being held down unless an abnormal amount of force is used
454	neg	This issue would manifest in all applications, including just dragging windows from the OS
454	neg	Contacted logitech support and they jerked me around and expected an unreal amount of troubleshooting steps before they would consider my case further
454	neg	Even though the issue is known
454	neg	They wouldn't support my claim without rebinding mouse1 to a different key with their software and testing it and other ridiculous steps
454	neg	Even if the issue affects all applications and is known
454	neg	Used to buy logitech mice exclusively and religiously, happily with another retailer that actually offers support now
455	pos	I owned an older version of this mouse that I love and trust, but unfortunately it broke down a while back
455	pos	Naturally I ordered this as a replacement since I know and stand by the quality of Logitech products
455	pos	This one came slightly defective, however
455	pos	For every ~100 clicks, it will miss a click for some reason, which can be quite annoying for gaming
455	pos	I've researched online and it doesn't seem to be a common issue, so I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, which seemed to perform fine
455	pos	Overall it wasn't a big deal, but keep this in mind while using your mouse and definitely reach out to Amazon for support if you are experiencing the same thing
456	neg	The mouse was OK at first
456	neg	The five buttons were convenient, and the ability to customize its weight may appeal to some
456	neg	The backlighting is kind of cool
456	neg	However, it quickly built up a static charge that prevents the buttons from working properly
456	neg	When the buttons are held down, they randomly click every few seconds or so, which completely destroys the gameplay for which it was intended
456	neg	There is a workaround that involves unplugging the mouse and clicking furiously to discharge the static, but it's a very temporary solution that reduces the frequency of the clicks for a few hours before it's back to randomly clicking every few seconds when attempting to drag objects or move the camera
456	neg	Overall, I'm very disappointed with the mouse
457	pos	Pros: basically all of the features I love about the G9 mouse (I still have it, but 10 years on, I felt a potential replacement was in order)  button placement is intuitive  scroll wheel toggle is on the top side of the mouse as opposed to the bottom on the G9Cons:  It's not the G9Reality: It's a good mouse
457	pos	It's not as comfortable to use as my old school Logitech G9 mouse, but that could well be because I've been using it for 10 years
457	pos	That said, the features are on par with, if not better than the G9
457	pos	The build quality doesn't seem as good as the 9, but I get it
457	pos	Logitech is a company out to make a profit
457	pos	That said the G9 kind of tinted my view and looked to Logitech for a replacement
457	pos	Well played, Logi
457	pos	Well played
457	pos	Update November 25th, 2019: I really couldn't deal with the odd angle of the mouse and went with another Logitech mouse (G900 Chaos Spectrum)
457	pos	Don't get me wrong, the Hero is a really nice mouse
457	pos	It just isn't comfortable for my grip/hand placement
458	pos	I bought this as a replacement for my failing Logitech G9x
458	pos	The USB cable wore out after several years or use
458	pos	-Pros--Better lighting options than my old mouse
458	pos	Similar to my G910 Keyboard
458	pos	-Hero Sensor-More programmable buttons-The ability to change the weight of the mouse
458	pos	Similar to my old G9 and G9x mice
458	pos	-Cons--Less ergonomic
458	pos	My old mouse had interchangeable hand-grips
458	pos	Both of which felt better in my hand than the G502
458	pos	-Awkwardly positioned DPI buttons, next to the left mouse button
458	pos	I am constantly hitting them by accident, which is annoying
458	pos	(It's possible to disable, or reassign their function in the software settings
458	pos	) But I mostly feel like they get in the way
458	pos	-Overall-I loved my old G9 and G9x
458	pos	But as a replacement, this will do
459	pos	To start things off, I’ve been using this mouse for a few weeks now for heavy gaming and video editing
459	pos	So far, I have encountered zero problems
459	pos	The packaging and setup process was easy, and there were even included weights to make the mouse heavier for gaming (I haven’t found use for them)
459	pos	Also, the Logitech control interface wasn’t too confusing
459	pos	When the mouse was ready, using it was amazing as I felt a noticeable difference from Razer mouses
459	pos	The mouse wasn’t too heavy, and had helpful advantages like its buttons (I highly recommend setting them up to your personal preferences) Even when editing or using my PC, the mouse is comfortable for my big hands, and smooth when using
459	pos	Overall this mouse may be a bit ugly and pricey, but it’s made for gaming and not looks
459	pos	The quality is great for the price, and i’m happy with it
459	pos	(Also attached is a crappy photo I took of it)
460	pos	Mice have become more narrow over the past two and a half decades
460	pos	Am I supposed to be dragging my ring finger and pinky
460	pos	Curling them up under my palm
460	pos	Or hold the whole thing sideways
460	pos	Give me a nice deck for them to ride around on like the thumb
460	pos	Software isn't perfect, but it's closer to it than any previous Logitech software I've used
460	pos	Button profile sticks, only actual issue I've noticed is that sometimes the LEDs go factory default after the system comes out of standby
461	pos	First, I purchased the G502 Proteus Core, the first version of this mouse, then once that wore down after several years of use, I upgraded to the G502 HERO
461	pos	I'm now on my second G502 HERO, this one I purchased in March of 2021, and no other mouse beats this one in features and performance
461	pos	It's ergonomic, lightweight (or weighted with the included weights), and has easily programmable software and hardware profiles
461	pos	I hope there comes a day where I can look for another mouse, and switch to a different model, either by Logitech or some other brand, but the G502 Hero is currently the best mouse on the market for people who both want a good gaming mouse and a good productivity mouse
462	pos	GOOD: I really want to like the mouse
462	pos	The sensor is great and the feel of the mouse in my hands is great
462	pos	The weight adjustment is also a strong positive
462	pos	The logitech software works great and makes this mouse very resourceful
462	pos	BAD:The mouse wheel is horrible; it an infinite scroll that can be toggles
462	pos	The downside to this
462	pos	even this it toggled off the wheel feels unstable
462	pos	The wheel itself is coated by metal and makes it slip from one notch to another; due to this it makes the mouse sometimes not scroll all the expected lines, or an extra
462	pos	Overall:Good mouse, but not susceptible for what its advertised
462	pos	Scroll wheel makes it not usable for gaming
463	pos	I moved to this mouse from a R
463	pos	A
463	pos	T
463	pos	6 that had been dying on me, and after reading some reviews settled on this mouse
463	pos	It seems to work great both for work and gaming
463	pos	The G-Hub lighting stuff seems like a bit much, but I've never been into filling my PC full of colored LEDs
463	pos	The G-Hub software itself is flaky flaky flaky
463	pos	I'm really happy with the mouse though, my only real complaint is that it's not nearly as heavy as my old mouse, even with all of the weights added to it
464	pos	This is by far the best mouse I have ever owned, and I had the previous versions of this mouse that came out some years ago, and used them over the years
464	pos	Everything about this mouse is a plus, and I noticed only one con, so I'm gonna mention that
464	pos	The con is the button that unlocks the scroll wheel, the button sometimes goes half way and appears to be stuck, but if you press on it using a little bit more force the first time, this doesn't happen
464	pos	That's the only thing I could find that could be improved, I love everything else
464	pos	Note: if you are on Linux, then look for piper (package through apt - Debian)
464	pos	This will allow you to edit most of the options of this mouse
465	pos	Overall this mouse is amazing, best gaming mouse I've ever owned
465	pos	I love everything from the size, the button layout, to even the adjustable weight
465	pos	However not everything is rainbows and sunshine
465	pos	I have had this mouse for barely 6 months and already the right mouse button is malfunctioning badly
465	pos	This would not normally be a problem as I usually buy my Logitech gear directly from the Logitech website itself and their RMA process is very smooth and customer friendly
465	pos	I am having a difficult time trying to get help online from Amazon, there isn't any easy way to request RMA/Warranty information or get the RMA process started (I prefer not to have to call if It can be avoided)
465	pos	With some help from Google I found 2 email addresses for supposed customer support (cis@amazon
465	pos	com, primary@amazon
465	pos	com), however upon emailing them both I get a generic automated response: "Hello from Amazon,You've written to an address that does not accept incoming direct e-mails, but we have provided links to help answer some common questions
465	pos	"The email contains a bunch of links that don't help me at all, the "Returns & Refunds" link doesn't let me select the item in question
465	pos	Overall completely disappointed in Amazon's online custom,er service setup
465	pos	Shame because I'm a frequent purchaser, long time Prime member etc
465	pos	I was always told returns/refunds/rma's etc on products sold directly by Amazon was a quick and painless process
465	pos	Could not be any further from the truth
466	pos	The media could not be loaded
466	pos	The app and software are easy to use and modify
466	pos	Reposnce is amazing
466	pos	Not a big fan of rgb lights but can be turned off on the app
466	pos	Weights help big time if you are looking into competitive gaming, no more mouse sway if you are frustrated in a match and the mouse is too light
466	pos	Love the product and highly supported it
467	pos	After a few months, one of the side buttons started making a weird double-clicky sound and had a real strange tactile feel when clicking
467	pos	I contacted support, and they ended up sending me a new one free of charge
467	pos	My only other gripe is that the side buttons are a little bit far back on the mouse, so i really have to scrunch my thumb up to hit the back button (especially in games)
467	pos	I don't really notice it anymore though
467	pos	It's a nice mouse
468	pos	It is taller than my last mouse so had to lower keyboard drawer to make it fit
468	pos	Otherwise it is top quality that I expect from Logitech
468	pos	Really can't go wrong with anything you buy from Logitech
468	pos	They have been around since the PC was invented and consistently produced good products ever since
468	pos	I bought their speakers as well and love them
469	pos	The controls are great for changing sensitivity and the weights are useful for setting the weight
469	pos	I set mine to the heaviest, I like it that way for some reason
469	pos	The best feature by far is the scroll wheel
469	pos	I just unlock that thing and give it a spin
469	pos	I hear my coworkers constantly clicking away rolling their scroll wheels when reviewing large code files
469	pos	I always recommend this mouse to them
469	pos	I had a Razr Copperhead before this, which I loved
469	pos	This does not feel all that different, but with the scroll wheel it is a real winner
470	neg	Simply put, the G502 suffers from very common build issues
470	neg	A quick google for 'G502 double click' will return several posts of people complaining about the same issue
470	neg	My mouse in particular worked for about 8 months before it developed issues with both clicks
470	neg	I can't drag and drop without dropping a click, which means aiming in FPS is a real hurdle
470	neg	I'm not the only either, as there are several people
470	neg	The root of the cause is the OMRON switch that Logitech uses, which means that you can very easily go through 2 or 3 mice with the same issues
470	neg	I used a Logitech mouse for over 6 years before this, bus frankly the G502 is just a stain in the company's otherwise good record
470	neg	You might take your chances and get a good mouse, but there's no guarantee with this model
471	pos	I needed a mouse that would place nice with a KVM hooked up to my PC and Mac that had the ability to "unlock" the scroll wheel for quick scroll, and that had multiple buttons on the side
471	pos	This mouse just happened to have the exact number of extra buttons: play/pause, volume up and down, forward and backward, and one more to link to taking a screenshot
471	pos	I did disable the scroll wheel's side to side operation as I was hitting those accidentally, and the scroll wheel does sit a little too high for my taste, but other than that the software plays nice across both OSs and I'm happy with my purchase
472	neg	I purchased this mouse less than a year ago and recently began to have issues with the left mouse button registering multiple clicks on press
472	neg	I went to a web app that shows mouse events and the issue seemed to be caused when any pressure is applied off center (like near the edges of the button)
472	neg	It would register up to 10 clicks if I pressed once along the edges and held down for a few seconds before releasing
472	neg	I've looked into this problem here/elsewhere and it seems to be faulty switches being used for this series
472	neg	Another issue I've had since the beginning has been the middle mouse button
472	neg	In addition the scrolling up/down and middle mouse click, you can also rock the middle mouse to the sides to click a middle left/right input
472	neg	The problem is that it is nearly impossible to click the middle mouse button without "accidentally" clicking the middle left/right button instead
472	neg	From comments here, it seems to be a crap-shoot on whether you get a easy to use middle mouse button from this model
472	neg	I debated on returning the mouse from the start, but I've gotten around this by simply disabling the middle mouse button entirely (and remapping to another button) while keeping the left/right middle mouse buttons functionality
472	neg	I lost a button on the mouse, but still had plenty mappings for what I used it for (have another MMO mouse for games needing more buttons)
472	neg	My brother has a Razer Trinity mouse and I have another previously mentioned Logitech MMO mouse with this same button feature and have no problems clicking all 3 middle mouse buttons without issue
472	neg	I'm going to try to RMA this mouse, but If I could go back I would have returned at the start

473	pos	I really like this mouse
473	pos	The side that holds your thumb is heaven sent, all the side buttons are handy, and I like that you can change the weights
473	pos	However, I read the reviews and knew that this investment wasn’t gonna be the best because so many people had issues
473	pos	I thought my issues weren’t gonna happen until at least a month, but not even THREE days after purchasing, my scroll wheel is like a fidget spinner
473	pos	Lol
473	pos	Honestly, y’all better off spending ya money on something similar but not logitech, cause I don’t think they really care about the production of their products
474	neg	The mouse itself is nice, but the center scroll wheel is unusable
474	neg	The wheel doesn't catch, as other reviews have described as well, making it terrible for gaming and for general reading of the web (if you use the center scroll wheel to move down and up pages)
474	neg	Returned and bought the Logitech G PRO Hero Wired Gaming Mouse instead
474	neg	Not as slick looking, but functions great
474	neg	Unlike the G502 HERO, the center scroll wheel works perfectly on the G PRO Hero
475	pos	I absolutely loved this mouse while it was working correctly
475	pos	I bought this to replace my Razer Naga since Razer products have been getting worse over the years
475	pos	It was responsive, the button layout was fantastic, and the weight was almost perfect for what I needed
475	pos	That all ended up about 2 months after I bought it
475	pos	Out of nowhere, it started to double click all on it's own
475	pos	This effectively rendered the mouse 100% useless for gaming
475	pos	I ended up going back to my old retired Naga
475	pos	:(
476	pos	I'm gonna keep this short; Logitech products are generally an all-rounder when it comes to hardware
476	pos	If you're looking for the type of gaming mouse that's basically well rounded but doesn't excel at any particular task then this is your tool
476	pos	It feels great, materials used were solid and sturdy enough to last you throughout long gaming sessions(Generally 8-12 hours)
476	pos	That being said, to an average gamer that doesn't really need extensive button mapping and extremely precise mouse accuracy it's more than excellent and will provide you with a pretty good gaming experience
476	pos	The button functions even get weird if you program your mouse to have too high of a DPI so I'd be careful with that
477	neg	This is not for people with small hands at all
477	neg	My mouse would not actuate the click because of poor quality control on the moldings so gaming was horrific and holding Left Mouse button down is nearly impossible
477	neg	I highly recommend another brand of mouse if you are a woman or a small handed person or require holding a left mouse button to work with
477	neg	I give it a "Do Not Buy" rating when an Off Brand has better quality control
478	pos	After many years of using a G500, it took a day or two to get used to the new feel
478	pos	However, I am glad I did
478	pos	This mouse is great
478	pos	I use the extra weights to make it heavier like my older mouse, but it feels great with or without them
478	pos	I did have a little fun playing with the RGB, but mostly I just wanted a mouse that would bounce easily between productivity and gaming and this one checks all the boxes
479	pos	I ordered a few other mouses before I settled on this one
479	pos	I couldn't afford the wireless edition and really didn't want to deal with cords, but it's not a big deal now that I have it
479	pos	The moment I unboxed this and held it, I could clearly feel and see how high quality the components are
479	pos	Left and right click have a certain smoothness to them that I haven't felt on another mouse
479	pos	The RGB customization is a nice plus, but it doesn't offer that much in the way of options
479	pos	The infinite scroll wheel is dope and has already changed the game for my mindless reddit scrolling
479	pos	I also like that the scroll wheel is made of metal, it just feels nice when you rotate it and feel the snap when it's not on the infinite scroll setting
479	pos	Finally, this thing offers a sensor that is as smooth as butter
479	pos	I ordered this with a hard mouse pad and dang
479	pos	It's like moving a warm spoon over some country crock
479	pos	Overall I'm highly satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a nice mouse for a better daily grind or gaming with a comp
480	pos	I love the mouse
480	pos	It is definitely for someone with smallish hands
480	pos	No way my husband could use this mouse
480	pos	The only problem with it is that the bottom gamma off all the time
480	pos	It opens so you can adjust the weight with provided weights
480	pos	It is held closed with a magnet but falls off all the time
480	pos	We put a little Lock-tite on the slip in edge and it has held sense
481	pos	Just like most of the razer products it feels so nice in the hand when gaming
481	pos	All buttons feel like they’re in the perfect place
481	pos	I recommended this to my good friend and he agrees it’s the best mouse he’s owned
481	pos	Would definitely recommend
482	neg	Thought it was just me but after testing two other mice and with two separate machines, this mouse left click is constantly cutting out, skipping and has terrible input lag
482	neg	Doing some research I found that it's very common with this model, no wonder it was on sale back when I bought it
482	neg	Too late to return it now and severely disappointed as I've always but Logitech but now I'm going to branch out and try a different brand
482	neg	Again, disappointed for a $90 product with such a large name behind it
483	pos	I used the G503 spectrum mouse before and i hated the braided cable it got
483	pos	if u keep it in one position the cable is gonna get stiff and be locked in that way but it was still a good mouse felt nice and smooth
483	pos	but this new G503 hero has a lovely cable which I'm loving so far with all the goodies from the spectrum and the smoothness feels like much better with this and feels better in my hand its a steal for the price it sells for 10 out 10 for me
484	pos	Absolutely, love this mouse
484	pos	I don’t really game but the faster settings helps me complete work for my job quicker
484	pos	I can take test faster too
484	pos	My husband has one for gaming and he loves it for gaming
484	pos	The keys lock for scrolling and unlock
484	pos	It has color choices
484	pos	I added a few weighs to mine which comes with it
484	pos	Love this mouse
485	neg	so i have been having this mouse for alomost 2 years i loved it at the first year
485	neg	I used it lightly then started gaming heavily on it and thought nothing of it
485	neg	As of writing right now my left click is not responding as effectively and it seems like online forums complain about the same thing
485	neg	It seems to be a manufacturing problem which is pretty sad because nhoraml usage could be ignored but gaming is a huge setback from making this the perfect product
485	neg	Do not buy this mouse if you want it to have an early expiration date
486	neg	I loved everything about this mouse -- it feels incredibly natural and accurate
486	neg	However, after 6 months of just ordinary computer usage (not gaming, working on spreadsheets and programming and the like) it stopped being able to consistently drag windows
486	neg	Then I realized that left clicks weren't registering consistently anymore
486	neg	Then I did a quick Google search and it appears that EVERY G502 develops this problem after a relatively short amount of usage
486	neg	I ended up plugging in an old G5 Logitech gaming mouse that I had sitting around, and it still works perfectly
486	neg	I'm not buying any new products from Logitech after this, I'll just buy used ones -- they work just as well and they're reliable
487	pos	Got this when it was on a pretty good sale
487	pos	I like it, but some of the buttons are pressed too easily
487	pos	For example, the DPI buttons change too easily when left-clicking
487	pos	It's frustrating, so I just disabled those buttons within the G Hub software
487	pos	I like a light mouse, so I didn't add any of the weights and it's the perfect weight for me
487	pos	The wheel has a satisfying "grind" to it so you can tell how much/how fast you are scrolling, unlike some other mice where you may over-scroll
488	pos	As of this writing, I'm currently overhauling my PC gaming setup
488	pos	My previous mouse, a Corsair Dark Core RBG, had completely lost all functionality only after two years from purchase
488	pos	I was blueprinting some ideas for a replacement and read a lot of great things about Logitech G products
488	pos	I've used previous Logitech equipment some odd years ago for general computer use and thought I would take the plunge on the gaming aspect of the brand
488	pos	Needless to say, i'm glad I did and the good reviews for this product are well-deserved
488	pos	The mouse feels wonderful to hold
488	pos	I was worried at first because it did feel a little light and hollow out of the box
488	pos	This is where the included five 3
488	pos	6g weights come into play
488	pos	The weights act to give some stability for higher DPI settings and also give some weight to help with maneuvering the mouse on certain surfaces
488	pos	This part might actually be tricky upon getting it out of the box as I had to mess around and add/remove weights until I just got the right natural feeling when moving it
488	pos	This was not too huge of an issue as even the Logitech website had recommended adjusting the weights until you feel what works
488	pos	I'm glad the ability to change the weight was included as I have big hands and need an ample amount of weight for the mouse to feel great in my palm
488	pos	The middle mouse wheel is unique in that it has a toggle button for a dual-mode use; one has the mouse wheel scroll freely and super smoothly (perfect for browsing or getting to the top/bottom of a page with just a quick flick) and the other mode is a "scroll clicker," perfect for making precise digital art or designs or when you need to swap out to that second weapon in your favorite FPS
488	pos	Its because of this that the mouse has more functionality beyond just gaming
488	pos	The ergonomic build is great as well
488	pos	No matter how I hold it, the mouse feels like it melds into the shape of my palm and thumb
488	pos	The thumb rest is a nice addition too, keeping my thumb from sinking too low or dragging around my mousepad
488	pos	The quality of the entire mouse is just awesome
488	pos	Everything from the material used to the lighting effects and the design itself is perfect
488	pos	I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great mouse to game with, wither it's for the casual gamer or the PC gaming enthusiast
489	pos	The media could not be loaded
489	pos	I have used many many different mice
489	pos	Razer, Logitech, Mad Catz, Corsair
489	pos	All pretty similar really
489	pos	First time in a long time I haven't bought a 500 button mouse
489	pos	Not playing MMO's like I used to and didn't have a need to have fast button skills for my heals anymore
489	pos	Always loved how logitech felt in my hand
489	pos	Loved the idea of weights, because I like a heavier feel
489	pos	Plug and play and feels good
489	pos	Not at all disappointed
490	pos	Holy crap is it phenomenal
490	pos	I never knew I needed 3200 DPI, but I'm never going back
490	pos	The adjustable weights give it a nice heft, the size fits well, especially in larger hands
490	pos	All the buttons are great
490	pos	It's honestly one of the best features
490	pos	The scroll wheel is phenomenal
490	pos	The sheer adjustability is great, and the G HUB software is easy to use and one of the lest terrible of its kind
490	pos	It's blisteringly fast, and precise as well
490	pos	It's useful for everything from gaming to CAD modeling
490	pos	If I never had to get another mouse, I would be happy
491	pos	I've had 3 of these mice
491	pos	The first 2 were under warranty so I was able to get it replaced at no charge
491	pos	However, this last mouse, that I got as a replacement for one I purchased Sept
491	pos	2019 (I got it January 2020)
491	pos	This one too, is on it's way out
491	pos	I really love everything about this mouse, until it stops working
491	pos	I want a mouse that is more reliable, so I'm going to try the Deathadder elite this time
491	pos	And it has a 2 year warranty
492	neg	So, the mouse itself is pretty basic
492	neg	You can change the weight, it feels nice in my hand, and you can click one of the top buttons to change your mouse response time, but the software that you need to customize it, Logitech G Hub, has so many bugs
492	neg	I, like many others, have tried to download the software, but it gets stuck and downloads forever, and Logitech refuses to do anything about it
492	neg	And trying to remove the unusable software from your PC is also a pain
492	neg	Another thing, the mouse wheel glides a bit TOO well
492	neg	I'll be playing a game, and if I move my mouse a certain way, the wheel moves and cycles through my hot bar
492	neg	It's also a pain when you're just browsing the internet and you want to scroll down a little, and it sends you to the bottom of the page
492	neg	Honestly, don't buy this unless it's on sale, or until Logitech gets their s*** together
493	neg	Designers clearly had never seen or used a mouse before, but merely overheard a vague description of one at a particularly loud social event
493	neg	Useless button right where thumb is supposed to grip, gets in the way of you trying to do anything precise like aim in a video game
493	neg	Scroll wheel is raised and extremely sensitive, so you'll accidentally scroll on webpages or cycle inventory in games
493	neg	There is a button near the thumb that sends you "back" on web browsers
493	neg	I just discovered this because I ACCIDENTALLY DELETED THIS VERY REVIEW AND AM WRITING IT FOR A SECOND TIME
494	neg	I purchased this mouse in the beginning of 2020 and in May, it is starting to double-click
494	neg	The issue has become so bad that it is sometimes impossible for me to highlight text, drag icons around on my desktop, or play a character like Hanzo in Overwatch
494	neg	I wish I had done more research before purchasing any type of mouse from Logitech, but the issue stems from the switches they use
494	neg	These fail relatively quickly because of how cheap they are, coming from China
494	neg	Many other people around the internet have had the same issues so most likely, you're going to need to RMA the mouse every four months, learn how to fix the switches yourself, or just buy a computer mouse from another company
494	neg	I had used a Corsair M65 without any actual trouble for over two years prior to deciding to try something new and will be trashing this one to go back to Corsair
494	neg	I have been PC gaming for over twenty years now and have never found myself as frustrated with a mouse since using the G502 HERO
494	neg	Logitech will tell you that it could be the USB port or that the mouse just needs its drivers updated but this simply isn't true
494	neg	If a mouse is double clicking, it's likely hardware within the device that is failing or broken
495	neg	This mouse has a good feel
495	neg	I like the weight and the button placement
495	neg	I have had this mouse almost exactly 2 years
495	neg	About a year ago, I started getting the double click issue (Google it
495	neg	It is a common problem) on the left mouse button
495	neg	I pulled it apart and messed with the switch and was able to to resolve the issue but the click just isn't the same
495	neg	Now I am starting to experience the same issue with the right button
495	neg	Looks like it's time to buy a new mouse, and I will not be getting another Logitech G
496	pos	The mouse is actually pretty good
496	pos	and at a very good price
496	pos	The software is the most confluting unnecessary POS I have ever come across
496	pos	If the hub didn't look so good, I would have mistaken it for a government website
496	pos	I would have given this mouse a 4 or 5 but because they (for some unknown reason) refuse to update their software I am compelled to give it a 3
497	pos	After a few months of use, the mouse is having this double click issue that frequently affects me when I'm trying to play a game
497	pos	I will attempt to press and hold down the mouse button and it will stutter and think that I have let go and clicked again
497	pos	It also makes it tough to drag windows across my screens since I have to try several times until I can click the window without it double clicking
498	pos	I made the switch to the G502 from a Corsair M65 Elite RGB and its ridiculous how much better this is in overall quality feel, the Ghub software is easier to use, and this is personal preference but heavier, the G came with heavier weights to insert into the mouse, I prefer a heavier feeling mouse so I dont fling the thing across my desk lol
498	pos	Of course time will tell if it'll last longer than the Corsair but honestly, I've gone through three Corsair mice in less than a year, I have high hopes
499	pos	I've owned this mouse for about 6 months and up until now, everything has been great
499	pos	The mouse is super responsive, very ergonomic, and all the customizable buttons are fun to play with
499	pos	As of late, I've started to notice that the left click will often double or triple click when only pressed once (probably an issue with the switch)
499	pos	As one can imagine, typical tasks such as navigating Windows and playing games become a nightmare
499	pos	Programs are accidentally double clicked and launched, and inputs are inconsistent
499	pos	I love this product, but I'm afraid that I will have to purchase a new mouse if I am unable to fix or resolve this
500	pos	After endless problems with other mice with double clicking in the first 3 weeks to 6 months, this mouse has been a solid performer
500	pos	With the high definition sensor unlocked, it has provided me with the most accurate gaming experience to date
500	pos	This all starts several years ago, I had one of these G502's that I severed the USB cable by accident with my keyboard drawer slides
500	pos	The retail shop had no exact replacement, so I was forced to exchange it for a different model / brand
500	pos	I was less than happy with that device and traded it in for another model / brand
500	pos	It started misbehaving in less than 4 months
500	pos	While not a new device, the G502 Hero has been solid for all my needs from day one
500	pos	Sometimes an old standard wins the day
501	neg	Initially, this mouse was great, however, at the eleven-month mark, the mouse started getting the dreaded double-clicking issue that Logitech is known for
501	neg	Attempting to claim a warranty on the mouse has been a hassle
501	neg	First, I had to file a ticket and wait for a reply, then provide a picture of the mouse along with stuff written next to it on paper to confirm I have the mouse, and THEN they wanted me to record a video of my mouse and screen showing the issue
501	neg	I stopped right there
501	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again
502	pos	Honestly, I don't care if my mouse has all sorts of bells and whistles
502	pos	I want it to be comfortable and reliably repeat the functions a mouse was originally intended for
502	pos	This one has been decent so far
502	pos	I'm waiting to see how long it takes for the little clip inside the clicker buttons to break since that's what's happened to my last 2 mice, but until then it's working to my satisfaction
503	pos	I have a wireless version of this mouse as well and while I like the lack of a cable this is an excellent mouse if you don’t mind the cable
503	pos	You have a case of weights so that you can easily change the weight of the mouse to suit your preferences
503	pos	You can also change the DPI on the fly which is nice
504	neg	G-Hub crashes constantly, and when it does the mouse does not retain its dpi settings making for an incredibly annoying user experience
504	neg	The dpi adjust buttons are in a bad location that constantly get pressed accidentally so I had to disable them
504	neg	EDIT: After investigating I solved the issue; but it shouldn't have been an issue and should have been enabled by default (on-board memory mode) but Logitech wants to force their software on people
504	neg	Adjusted rating slightly
504	neg	This mouse is way way overrated because it's pushed by amazon recommendation
505	pos	I bought this mouse for Christmas and it was something that I had been looking at for 2 years now
505	pos	I opened the box and it was awesome
505	pos	I plugged it in right away and it worked great
505	pos	All the other people in the reviews are saying that the scroll wheel is awful and that it spins freely
505	pos	It doesn’t do any of that
505	pos	The scroll whee has an awesome texture and it very smooth
505	pos	Anyways who is going to care about the scroll whee in competitive gaming
505	pos	And the scroll wheel DOES NOT break and spin freely
505	pos	There is a button the top of the mouse that switches between freely spin mode and regular scroll wheel mode
505	pos	The sensor is absolutely amazing and the software is very intuitive
505	pos	You can change the color of the G logo and the dpi lights as well as the function of the buttons
505	pos	The ergonomics of it is amazing
505	pos	I put a comparison of pictures from my mouse to my keyboard and my hand to my keyboard and my hand on my mouse to see the real size because I thought it was much bigger when I ordered it
505	pos	The second you put it in your hand everything changes
505	pos	It comes with weights to put on if you want it heavier or lighter
505	pos	Get this mouse and have your gaming experience changed forever
506	neg	I have come to learn if something is on sale on Amazon, beware
506	neg	It is either an inferior or faulty product
506	neg	I will be seeking a refund for this purchase
506	neg	1/5 for ergonomics, it has a focus button right where my thumbs fingertip is, where i apply pressure to move the mouse
506	neg	So I either have to slide my thumb down from this button which tilts the y axis causing up and down movements to be angle
506	neg	OR let my thumb rest on the button but when I apply pressure to move the mouse it clicks the button and changes the DPI1/5 for gaming
506	neg	Despite keeping the firmware up to date ( an annoying process with bloatware) and despite multiple mouse pads and surfaces
506	neg	The mouse will freeze in place despite moving the mouse hiccuping every few seconds, making some gaming IMPOSSIBLE
506	neg	1/5 quality of material
506	neg	Cheep plastic, the included weights dont help
506	neg	This is the worst mouse I have ever bought
507	neg	I was looking for a replacement mouse and saw an online review for the G502
507	neg	It showed everything I wanted from a gaming mouse so I quickly ordered one from Amazon
507	neg	Out of the box I've had nothing but left click issues with this mouse
507	neg	Looking through the Amazon reviews it appears this is a common issue with the switches Logitech used for this mouse
507	neg	Nearly every left click either hangs and creates a drag command or double clicks
507	neg	This product fails completely at its primary job and it should be avoid completely until Logitech resolves the issues with their products
508	pos	My G
508	pos	Skill Ripjaws mouse finally started having issues
508	pos	I think the cable has a short
508	pos	Lasted a few years
508	pos	I like the idea of being able to add or take weight from the mouse to balance it or make the feel what you want
508	pos	i did dislike the you have to press down on the scroll wheel to use it
509	neg	I like the mouse overall but the left click is breaking
509	neg	It will either double click, not register a click at all, or if your holding it down it stops registering
509	neg	Very frustrating when you trying to play a game where you need to hold the button down or when you need to drag stuff
509	neg	Still have this issue after trying everything out there
509	neg	Update drivers
509	neg	Remove other mouse drivers
509	neg	Update usb drivers, etc
509	neg	Nothing works
509	neg	30 day warranty on products is a ripoff  I have loved Logitech products in the past but i will not EVER be buying again
509	neg	Mouse is pretty much broken after 2 months
509	neg	UPDATE:  Got a replacement from Logitech and after about a week its doing the same thing
509	neg	The problem is intermittent  but makes this mouse the worst mouse i've ever used
509	neg	Avoid it
510	neg	I noticed this issue around a month or two after owning it that the left click was rather defective but the issue was so intermittent at first that I thought it might have been a software issue
510	neg	The issue has become so pronounced now that the mouse is no longer usable and I am past the return period so I am unsure what to do with it
510	neg	I've read that for whatever reason this is a common issue with this model and Logitech has refused to do anything about it
510	neg	Rather disappointed with Logitech, I've generally only had good experiences with their peripherals in the past, and it's a shame that this product is now making me question if I should continue buying their products in the future
511	pos	I use this at work and liked it so much that I bought one for home (light gaming, work)
511	pos	After a year of daily use, the mouse died (it doesn't light up and wouldn't be recognized as a valid USB device in Windows and Mac) while being used as an input device in a USB switch setup
511	pos	I'm not sure whether the frequent switching (essentially unplugging/replugging without the physical stress) hastened its demise, but either way it's hard to be satisfied with more than 3 stars for this price given 1 year of lifespan
512	pos	My last g502 didn't have the RGBs in it but it's practically the same mouse, I will say with or without the weights in the mouse it's REALLY heavy regardless
512	pos	I just can't get away from the unlockable mouse scroll wheel
512	pos	My biggest issues are that when I move this one side to side it's like it's not tight on the inside and shakes a little and also GHUB is a very buggy and power-hungry application
513	pos	Great mouse
513	pos	Already have 2 of them for work and home
513	pos	Perfect value
513	pos	Very satisfied with software
513	pos	RGB is normal, but I’m not a fan of RGB in general
513	pos	DPI settings are just the best
513	pos	Up to 25600
513	pos	Customization is good
513	pos	On my first unit already have a bit of paint scratching on metallic scroll wheel
513	pos	Not an issue with functionality and overall look
513	pos	First mouse purchase after which there’s not even a sense to check for better
513	pos	Value is amazing
513	pos	Bought both units with deals for 40 USD
514	pos	If you aren't aware of the G502, you haven't been listening
514	pos	It's a great corded mouse
514	pos	No issues at all
514	pos	It clicks, it moves, software has been good, never any issues
514	pos	It fits my hand well, I prefer this style of mouse more than others
514	pos	Great mouse
514	pos	The wireless version of the G502, Lightspeed; although more expensive, is just as good
514	pos	I used both
515	pos	Had to play with the settings quite a bit and as it turns out it was not the settings it was the mouse pad I had i have a hard surface mouse pad with wrist thing it made the mouse move all over the place it seems this mouse works best with the soft mouse pads would of been nice to know before I order the other mouse pad but ooh well it works now
516	neg	I don't leave reviews
516	neg	I made an exception for this beautiful piece of hot garbage
516	neg	This mouse started the slow process of dying only 8 months in
516	neg	A new record for me
516	neg	Quite the accomplishment you could say
516	neg	The left mouse button started sticking
516	neg	Now it's a year and a half in and the right mouse button has taken after it's slower brother and is sticking as well
516	neg	The left button has gotten to the point where the mouse isn't really usable anymore
516	neg	Not sure how they managed to regress so much from the G500 which I bought in 2012 and that lasted me SEVEN YEARS
516	neg	Somehow they managed it though
516	neg	Pros: Feels good on your hand
516	neg	Cons: Makes you hate your life after 8 months and you slowly spiral downwards as this mouse continues its inconsistent breaking process over the course of around a year before you finally give up and have to buy a new mouse, the whole while wondering what is wrong with our horrible world
517	neg	I was surprised to find an issue on Logitech mouse as idiotic as the mouse 1 button not functioning properly
517	neg	For being a gaming, mouse, it's infuriating having to click mouse 1 twice or attempting jam the button down and it still not working
517	neg	Im having it replaced and hopefully it won't have the same issue
518	pos	After one week of use, the side buttons along with the other buttons for the mouse started to fail
518	pos	Currently, the only buttons that work are the G5, middle mouse click and both the left and right mouse click
518	pos	The rest are bugging out and either do not register at all or stop midway
518	pos	However, if you’re only using the three main buttons (left, middle, and right mouse click) then you should be fine
518	pos	I’m just a little disappointed Seeing that the buttons failed after a few clicks
518	pos	I didn’t click on the buttons particularly hard and I’ve only started using the G4, right and left middle mouse buttons on the 8th day and it broke on that very same day
518	pos	Edit:I have received a new mouse and this one works fine
518	pos	I've been using it for a year now and this has been the best mouse I have ever owned
518	pos	The fact that you can adjust the weight is a nice touch too
519	pos	Comfortable in my hand
519	pos	I've got large hands, and it really fits two styles of how I grip the mouse
519	pos	The first being sort of a claw shape with my hand, and the second being a more 'palmed' holding of the mouse
519	pos	Either way, the mouse feels great
519	pos	The adjustable weights are a plus, and there is an incredible amount of customization with both the dpi and the inputs for the additional buttons
519	pos	Makes productivity and gaming much more enjoyable
519	pos	RGB is subtle and customizable as well
519	pos	Overall I've really been satisfied with this and I'd totally recommend it for the price point, which for me was about $40
520	neg	I bought it here recently, and at the start it was a good gaming mouse and did the job until I ran into a issue where the left and now right mouse button wont stick down for a extended hold on the buttons
520	neg	Did research and found out this is a manufacture default on the mouse itself
520	neg	Contacted Logitech and at first it was fine they told me within 72 hours we should be sending you a new one out
520	neg	10 days later since that last email
520	neg	Multi calls to product support, three emails to them and they have gone silent no update, nothing and its becoming harder to use the mouse
520	neg	Also do not get me started in the "Software" needed to use this product you can flush it down the toilet
520	neg	Every update I have had to uninstall software and reinstall and reprogram all the buttons to be able to use them
520	neg	I would give this product a 0 out of 5 if I am able to
520	neg	I will update if I ever hear anything back from support but at this time i will tell everyone do not buy this mouse, it sucks
521	neg	I loved this mouse for about 10 months then found out there's a problem with the left mouse button losing functionality over time that many others seem to have found after google searching whats wrong with mine suddenly losing clicks(or sometimes double when it should be a single)
521	neg	Mouse was good, keyword "was
521	neg	" If it had not failed on me this would be a solid top pick from me for gaming
521	neg	I am going to try to crack it open and fix it and if I cant then I'll buy a new mouse and when looking I will think real hard about picking another Logitech mouse after this
521	neg	I'm going to rate it a 2 overall even though I rate the others aspects above a 2 because if you aren't lucky this mouse is going to be a 1 or 2 but if it works for you its a great mouse
521	neg	If it had been more expensive I would rate it a 1, lasting less than a year isn't a good look
522	pos	I've had this mouse for years now, and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 on quality of material is that I recently had to replace it
522	pos	I'm not sure I actually hit the click guarantee, but eventually the mouse started double clicking every so often when I only single clicked
522	pos	It's still my favorite mouse though
522	pos	For medium to large hands, it's super comfy and easy to move around given the customizable weight
523	pos	This is my first nicer gaming mouse
523	pos	I used some cheaper "gaming" mice in the past, but this one is really nice
523	pos	I ended up using all the weights, as I like a little heft to my mice but what's really nice is the ability to customize the weight
523	pos	It works great, custom buttons, speed, etc
523	pos	I'm really pleased with it
524	pos	This is a great gaming mouse even just from plugging it in
524	pos	Within seconds it was easy to understand how it works
524	pos	For some reason downloading the Mouse setup online messed with the DPI changing button but after playing with it I was able to fix it and now I get to enjoy the move speed I actually care about
524	pos	Just in case you also had the issue, in the Logitech G Hub simply click the mouse, then under Assignments go to the System tab and you can drag and drop DPI Cycle onto the appropriate button
524	pos	The buttons on the side are great to have too, especially since I am practicing for when I get a 60% keyboard
524	pos	Overall great mouse both in and out of games
525	neg	The mouse was great for a while
525	neg	Feels good in the hand, slides well, removable weights, enough extra buttons, nice design
525	neg	But none of that matters when the left click starts registering multiple clicks
525	neg	The usability of the mouse plummets when basic navigation becomes frustrating
525	neg	I have not yet submitted a support case with logitech but I plan to
526	pos	This is a great mouse with all sorts of buttons and glides smooth
526	pos	The information that comes with it is very lacking
526	pos	It gives you a website to go to but you stumble around to find what you are looking for
526	pos	You need a program from said site to adjust the settings
526	pos	This mouse is not for me however
526	pos	Nothing to do with quality or how it basically works, it’s just that this mouse is for a palm user and I am more of a finger hybrid user
526	pos	My old mouse was smaller and that’s probably how I got used to finger over palm
527	pos	Pros: Basically everything
527	pos	Great response time, great customization for mouse functions, feels great in the hand, all around great
527	pos	I love how it looks, I love it in almost every way, so just because the cons list is longer, doesn't mean its not an incredible mouse
527	pos	Cons: Two cons: 1
527	pos	The weights fit very tightly in both the mouse and the case, and they're kind of annoying to put in and take out
527	pos	2
527	pos	The RGB customization is not that great
527	pos	You can only do 3 effects, one of which you have no choice of colors, but RGB is probably the least important part of the mouse, so not a bug deal
527	pos	And one issue that I think was just because mine was a bit faulty, the color of the RGB is off
527	pos	When I set it to white (R255 G255 B255) it appears blueish green
527	pos	to make it look white, I have to set it to R255 G160 B160, and then it looks like a perfect white
527	pos	So I think the red lighting is weak, so I gets overpowered by the Green and blue
527	pos	Another example of this is when I set it to yellow, it appears green with a tint of yellow
527	pos	Keep in mind, the cons were just minor things
527	pos	Weights fitting weird, slight RGB issues, etc
527	pos	are not big things, don't let them keep you from buying this mouse
527	pos	This is an incredible product, I've tried other mice, and I would always go with the G502 series without hesitation, and they are by far the most comfortable mice I've ever held
527	pos	And with this many buttons, you would think that some of them would be really annoying to press, right
527	pos	Nope
527	pos	A couple are a little uncomfortable, but at least 10 are quite easy and comfortable to press
527	pos	There's a reason that the G502 series is so popular, after all
527	pos	The best mouse you can buy for under $100 in my opinion
528	neg	Avoid this mouse for gaming
528	neg	It has a defect with the scroll wheel that will have you constantly switching weapons in games like Call of Duty Warzone
528	neg	It’s super annoying and unusable
528	neg	Check the internet this is a common issues for this mouse
528	neg	Wish I’d done more research before buying
529	pos	After having a Magic Eagle mouse for about 5 years, I replaced it with this
529	pos	I am a PC gamer, but didn't want all the fancy bells and whistles that come with others
529	pos	Whereas this does have weights to help with controllability, I found that using it straight of the box as it, was perfect
529	pos	It has excellent response time (I usually play snipers) and the DPI is customizable
529	pos	If you use the Logitech software, you can customize the colors with it to match your set up with no problem
529	pos	It fits comfortably in my hand, which is much needed as I am usually at the PC for a good chunk of my day for work and gaming
530	pos	After a coworker of mine had suggested that I try utilizing a keyboard and mouse set up for Call of Duty on the xbox, I decided to give it a go since my entry into 1st person shooters started years ago on a pc
530	pos	I will say that I absolutely love the ergonomics and feel of this mouse, as well as its sensitivity and customization abilities as far as button mapping is concerned, which is ridiculously easy with the Call of Duty interface
531	neg	If you only had 3 fingers this mouse is great
531	neg	But unfortunately i have 5 and this mouse isn't built for that
531	neg	I searched for "large gaming mouse" since it seems everything is made for children's hands
531	neg	Alas I saw reviews saying this mouse was huge and great for big hands, but I was fooled
531	neg	It is in fact a regular size mouse
531	neg	I've used logitech mice for 20 years or so, I can't remember because I'm old; but I cannot find a mouse to fit my hands
531	neg	If you have big hands, this is not the mouse for you
532	pos	It might be this specific model, it might be the average of this model, but the sensor will malfunction here and there, making a character look straight up and spin in a circle
532	pos	It's very frustrating, and not something I've dealt with in Logitech mice before
532	pos	I had a proteous spectrum that had click issues in it's later life, but I know I am the cause for that
532	pos	This issue started as soon as I got it, and still does
532	pos	Otherwise, I love the button configuration and have loved them for years
533	pos	I went through 2 Razer Mambas in less than 2 years
533	pos	First one had the grips starting to fall off in about a year
533	pos	RMA'd it and the 2nd had the same problem within a year
533	pos	I liked the feel, but wanted to hopefully get something better from them (and keep my keyboard/mouse Razer)
533	pos	Bought a Naga Trinity
533	pos	Larger, and took a week or so to get used to, but had some nice sideplates
533	pos	In LESS THAN A YEAR, it was double clicking with a single click or unable to drag without it releasing by itself
533	pos	Finally gave up and switched to this via advice from a friend
533	pos	This guy gives you the feel of the Razer Mamba (and way better than the Trinity), without (at least so far) double clicking or grip pad issues
533	pos	Perfect fit for my hand/grip just like the Mamba, customizable buttons that, unless you have big hands, you won't hit accidentally
533	pos	Will update if it decides to do the double-clicking issue like the Razer Trinity did or grip pads falling off like the Mamba
534	pos	This mouse fits my very average sized hands well with a claw type grip
534	pos	The inside and outside of this mouse has rubberized grips that enhance traction
534	pos	It also has excellent tracking and works really well for every game I use it with
534	pos	I honestly could care less about the lighting, but it is customizable and looks cool, I guess
534	pos	The scroll wheel has a nice solid "click" to it, and that can be turned off to allow infinite scrolling
534	pos	If you need a gaming mouse, here it is
535	pos	Is a Shame leave a bad review about thus mouse because I love this mouse while ir lasted, Is very funcional, ergonomic and love  His desing but I'm have to be honest, if you want a durable mouse for daily gaming dont buy this mouse, I bough this mouse 7 months ago and actually, right and left click stopped working, I have a chinese and cheap mouse  2 years ago, and still working like firts day, ir a Shame this Logitech, whit that price, and popular didnt last 8 months, I'm very dissapointed with this mouse, Gonna buy Corsair mouse could be better than this trash
536	neg	Once I got past the mouse driver needing to have access to *record my screen* (it didn't function without it
536	neg	) just to set up the muse profiles, I was able to store the profiles on the mouse itself and delete the software
536	neg	I was then reasonably happy with it up until it started not registering the thumb buttons (forward/back in the browser) reliably
536	neg	Then it got worse: now they don't work at all, and I have to cycle through the profiles on the mouse just to get any buttons to work at all (I think because the computer thinks the forward/back buttons are just being pressed all the time, so it doesn't even register the normal left/right buttons)
536	neg	Maybe I just got a bad one, this replaced another Logitech mouse that I'd had for over 5 years, but not even getting a year out of this one is terrible
537	neg	The mouse has had lighting issues since day one but I like the mouse so I disabled that and have been enjoying it
537	neg	Less than 4 months of use and it is now totally dead
537	neg	Logitech used to be a brand that would last years in the most abused situations, not die from light use
537	neg	I hope this isn’t a sign of where their brand is going
537	neg	I see a lot of other people with this same complaint of dead mouse after a few months
538	pos	This is a good mouse it feels nice and the programmable buttons are very nice to use for everyday work and also for gaming for buttons that are to reach on a keyboard when you are a gaming
538	pos	The software is good also a lot of people complain about it but for me it isn't to bad
538	pos	The mis-clicks I found true though it was not the left button it for me the two buttons next to the right button
538	pos	But I fixed it easy just unbinded them and it was problem fixed
539	neg	I've owned this mouse since October, it's now the end of May
539	neg	After seven full months of use, the left mouse button is double clicking and not holding when drag/drop is needed
539	neg	Apparently it's a common issue with this mouse
539	neg	I love the thumb buttons but would not repurchase due to lack of longevity
539	neg	Not like this is a cheap mouse
539	neg	Edit: After my initial issue in May, it started working (mostly) properly
539	neg	Now, in the end of July, it's double clicking way more often than it did in May
539	neg	Logitech has unrealistic hoops to jump through to get a refund/replacement
539	neg	I ordered a Razer mouse, will recycle this garbage
540	neg	I liked this mouse until it started doing this
540	neg	In instances where extended holding of one of the mouse buttons ( drag or drag-and-drop operations ), the mouse will begin throwing out multiple click events
540	neg	This is pretty upsetting when you're expecting to be able to drag a thing from a place and then suddenly your dude stops doing that because the game thinks you clicked the mouse again
540	neg	Considering this is a GAMING mouse meant for GAMING, this should not be a thing that is happening after just over a year of use
540	neg	It suggests poor workmanship or poor quality materials
540	neg	Or both
540	neg	The thing that is most upsetting is that this is not an uncommon issue
540	neg	I've searched on Google and found many posts about this exact same thing
540	neg	So if you do a lot stuff that requires you to hold down a mouse button, this is definitely not the product for you, unless you like replacing your mouse after a year
540	neg	Maybe the warranty is still good and I can get a refund for a more robust mouse
541	neg	This is the second G502 HERO mouse I've bought, the first one had a double click issue that started only 2 months after I bought it, so I went out and bought a new one locally
541	neg	I wanted to give it another chance because so many of my friends recommended it to me
541	neg	now the second one can't hold left click down for very long before it releases for a fraction of a second
541	neg	every time I try and drag and drop a window or folder it gets dropped half way
541	neg	Its very infuriating especially for someone who works from home on computers as well as games on computers
541	neg	From what I heard the newer models of this mouse has new cheaper mouse triggers that cause these issues
541	neg	You can see plenty of other people complaining about the clicking issues these mice had
542	neg	I bought this mouse last october
542	neg	In the past month I've been experiencing whenever I left click to drag a file or highlight something, it thinks I'm double clicking so it opens the file or lets go of highlighting
542	neg	When I click to play or pause a youtube video, it thinks I'm double clicking so it will full screen the video
542	neg	I use Adobe photoshop and premiere pro to edit my videos
542	neg	It is very annoying dealing with this double clicking
542	neg	After further researching this issue, I find out this is a common thing to have on this model in due time
542	neg	Video reviews won't mention this because they haven't used this mouse for months
542	neg	Wow Logitech
542	neg	I've always used logitech brand mice throughout my life and I've never seen this issue before, much less an issue at all within a couple months of purchase
542	neg	Logitech really dropped the ball
543	pos	Love my Logitech G602, but was looking to replace it with a wired version with some higher DPIs
543	pos	I tried to "get used to" the G502 for a week, but I'm giving up
543	pos	Biggest problem is how stiff the scroll wheel button is to click, combined with having to avoid hitting the side-to-side button clicks on the scroll wheel - annoying
543	pos	The other problem is with the radical undercut on the front of the mouse - when clicking and dragging I was causing the back of the mouse to lift up, then when I'd release it would drop down again which moved the mouse placement and the thing I was dragging would get "dropped" in the wrong place
543	pos	I managed to train myself to use a lighter touch after a few days, but it was an annoying few days
544	neg	Logitech is usually my go to in terms of peripherals
544	neg	However after owning this mouse for about 21 days
544	neg	I’d have to reconsider my options
544	neg	After 2 weeks, the mouse started to become non responsive
544	neg	The mouse arrow on my screen would stray downwards by itself
544	neg	The mouse itself would freeze
544	neg	The lights would shut off, andAfter numerous attempts to fix it I opted to return the mouse
544	neg	I tested this on another desktop and laptop
544	neg	Uninstalled, reinstalled, updated software, swapped USB ports, ran SFC and DISM to no avail
544	neg	Going from a G602 which I used for years, I’m a bit disappointed
544	neg	The reason in replaced it, was due to several years of use, the 602 started to have the notorious double click bug
544	neg	Be weary
545	pos	I don't understand whether or not you know there is a button right behind the scroll lock that enables or disables the scroll "locking" feature
545	pos	I have had mine for a year now and I can happily say this is the best mouse for gaming and computing that I have ever owned
545	pos	The scroll lock still works like a clock
546	pos	What can you say
546	pos	Probably the best wired gaming mouse out there
546	pos	I use it solely with fingertip grip and it's perfect
546	pos	Use it at both home and work
546	pos	Love the metal scroll wheel with either standard scrolling or freescrolling
546	pos	Software is pretty good
546	pos	Only thing I noticed was the scroll wheel wobbles a bit side to side if you quickly move the mouse side to side in a wiggling motion
546	pos	Doesn't seem to have any impact on operation and occurs rarely
547	neg	I have to left click hard in order for the mouse to register a click now
547	neg	I thought it was something wrong with my computer since right click was working fine until i randomly clicked hard on left click and it registered a click then i realized it was the mouse
547	neg	I bought sliders and grips for the mouse, im sad it broke
548	neg	I bought this mouse in December 2019
548	neg	Around February or March I noticed that during games my mouse would seem like it would double right click
548	neg	I didn't think about it until recently when it is now double clicking every other time or 3-4 times in a row
548	neg	I looked it up and this is a common problem with this mouse
548	neg	I have tried moving USB slots, updating firmware, re-installing driver, and cleaning mouse with air can
548	neg	I think this is just defective but I am outside of the return window
548	neg	If you are looking for mice, I cannot recommend this one
549	neg	The web blogs are true
549	neg	There is a left click problem with this one
549	neg	Sometimes it doesn't even work
549	neg	You have to use it in combination with the right click button
549	neg	Not consistent
549	neg	My $10 mouse is still reliable
549	neg	So disappointed
549	neg	Maybe it really is for a gaming pc only, not for use with a mini pc
550	pos	I would give this mouse a perfect score if it weren't for G-hub
550	pos	The application for controlling the mouse isn't very well done and has multiple issues
550	pos	Otherwise the mouse is great
550	pos	It's comfortable in the hands
550	pos	Adjustable weights are very nice and evenly distribute the weight based on where you put them
550	pos	(I have small hands and usually use a heavier mouse) I'm happy the mouse had options on it
550	pos	The buttons on the mouse itself are completely programmable to the extent you can even remap left and right click to something else
550	pos	(Don't know why you would unless you were running scripts for those keys but I digress
550	pos	) Buttons are clicky and feel descent quality
550	pos	(I use mechanical keys on my keyboard and the mouse seems to have a similar activation on it's side buttons to my otomu blue keys) The left and right click are light actuation points which is great for shooter games where who clicks first has a high degree of importance
550	pos	Overall can't fault the mouse just wish the software for it were better
551	neg	Driver doesn't recognize device after first update
551	neg	Without a functional driver this device is just a worthless piece of plastic
551	neg	I came from razer after experiencing the same problem with them
551	neg	Countless hours wasted troubleshooting to no avail
551	neg	Also the scroll wheel button doesn't work because they added buttons on either side of it, which you have to lean to activate, so when you try to push the scroll wheel button down it will just fall to one side and push something you didn't want to
551	neg	So don't expect to use that
551	neg	The button furthest back on the mouse near your palm, is too far back to reach comfortably
551	neg	So realistically this mouse has 9 functional buttons
551	neg	Which is still pretty good, but I wasn't impressed with GHUB before it stopped working, and now I can't use it at all
552	neg	All the other reviews about the mouse button double-clicking are NOT exaggerating
552	neg	If anything, they undersell the problem
552	neg	It started off as a rare occurrence, but over time became an issue for about 50% of clicking
552	neg	It WILL mess you up with everything like gaming, starting/pausing a video, and you can forget about clicking and dragging anything in peace
552	neg	Everything else about the mouse is awesome, but if a mouse can't even get the main function of all mice since their creation, what is it really good for
552	neg	How does a company let a problem like this happen, and for SO LONG
552	neg	The "firmware fix" that was supposed to resolve this issue did nothing
552	neg	I put up with this mouse for over a year now because I really liked how it felt, but the error ratio has steadily increased to beyond occasional frustration
552	neg	Save your money and look elsewhere
553	neg	This mouse is EXTREMELY overrated
553	neg	The weight is distributed horribly and it is INCREDIBLY SMALL
553	neg	If you are over 6 feet, chances are you or hands will engulf this uncomfortably
553	neg	My biggest grievance is the AWFUL MOUSE WHEEL
553	neg	I don't know why reviews are mentioning this but it is unusable
553	neg	It spins like crazy and can't be controlled
553	neg	It's so loose just moving your mouse quickly will cause it to spin
553	neg	The bottom of the mouse has a latch than can be removed so you can insert weights to make the mouse heavy, and its horrible
553	neg	Always comes off and the rubber is already peeling
553	neg	It's obvious the company pays Amazon to push this mouse to the top of searches
553	neg	AVOID MOUSE
554	neg	Total piece of junk
554	neg	Just like every other Logitech product in the last few years that I have been burned by
554	neg	Double clicking issue, no need for me to go in to it, just google / bing / what ever you use to find the wide spread issue, and their support was a total joke that makes you jump though hoops for everything under the sun that isn't related to the issue
554	neg	Purchased a Corsair wireless mouse ( the harpoon ) and haven't looked back
554	neg	Save your time and money, look past the marketing and google this mouse's issues before wasting your hard earned money
555	neg	This issue appeared a few days after I got it
555	neg	But it wasn't too bad, the issues appeared to be if you release your right-click slowly it will click it multiple times
555	neg	It works fine if you just hold it with normal force
555	neg	However, it will grow worse over time
555	neg	Now this game has made some fps (right-click to zoom) or wow(right-click to turn camera) literally unplayable after only 4 months of use
555	neg	By the time this issue has occurred to me, I have also done a little research, apparently, this is a very common issue with the G502 model
555	neg	I didn't find this issue affect MOBA too much, it still clicks, but anything requires you holding down the right-click button this would not be the ideal choice
555	neg	*Update: It's pretty easy to get support from their website, and they will send you another one shortly after its approved
555	neg	But this issue seems like a design flaw because the new one is starting to broke down as well
555	neg	Since I really like this mouse, I just bought two of them, and when one broke down and just switch to another one and open a ticket
555	neg	Its a shame, I wish they can release a fixed version
556	pos	Todo en este ratón es lo mejor, pero no se puede decir lo mismo del software, tiene bugs, a veces cuando se actualiza, se queda eternamente actualizando, haciendo que tenga que reiniciar de nuevo mi PC para que se actualice la aplicación, deberían poner mas efectos del RGB (LIGHTSYNC)
556	pos	pero el ratón en si esta bien
557	neg	Bought to replace a non functional old Deathadder
557	neg	Slightly less ergonomic, has more buttons, too big for my tiny hands
557	neg	Would buy again if it continues to function
557	neg	Review score lowered
557	neg	Only a few months in and the RMB is now suffering from the apparently infamous double click problem
557	neg	Double update
557	neg	I got a replacement from Logitech fairly easily but the replacement has the same problem on two different buttons
557	neg	It's pretty unfortunate and makes the product essentially unusable
557	neg	Currently looking for another mouse, do not buy
558	neg	It works but the software is junk
558	neg	The software keeps opening in some huge screen font and does not match your screen settings
558	neg	It was a pain to figure out to simply save the setting's and not have to redo them after every boot
558	neg	Too bad, the mouse is acceptable, the software is a mess
559	pos	This product have a really nice design, I like the quality they used on it, this mouse have a lot of programmable buttons
559	pos	What's also nice about this gaming mouse is that there's weights you can add and or remove
559	pos	That's something unique specifically for this mouse because there's not really a lot of mouses out there that can do that
559	pos	So you can change this mouse whether you like to feel a bit of heavy, or if you want it to be really light
559	pos	There is this one feature on the side of the mouse, it basically changes the DPI speed when you press and hold on it, which also counts as a programmable button by the way, that button might be problematic as you might click it with your thumb on accident
559	pos	Best way to work around it is either program it to something else or disable it
560	pos	I honestly almost returned it after a few rounds of Overwatch because the wheel was just freely spinning like WoW wHaT hIgH qUaLiTy but no, I'm dumb, there's a button right behind the wheel that toggles free spin
560	pos	Feels great, I wear a size L glove
560	pos	Weight is adjustable in case you want to weeb out and have it at precisely x grams instead of whatever it is now
560	pos	I wasn't sure about the button placement but after a few minutes they make a lot of sense and i don't have to adjust my hand to hit any of them
560	pos	Theres also a DPI indicator light which is shockingly handy when switching between several settings
560	pos	Bad news now is if you miss
560	pos	its not the mouse
561	pos	Great mouse
561	pos	One thing that got me was that the wheel has a button for free spin
561	pos	When it was set to free spin and not click like a normal wheel, I'd move the mouse and the wheel would spin slightly just enough to scroll a little bit, or switch my weapon in call of duty
561	pos	Pushed the button for free scroll just below the wheel and it did the trick
562	neg	The right click button feels as if it's worn out
562	neg	It does not have a distinct down-click like the left click does
562	neg	Plus, ITS A USED MOUSE
562	neg	WTH Amazon
562	neg	Why do you ship used crap
562	neg	I spent nearly 2 hours in chat support arguing with the reps for a SIMPLE QR CODE to return it
562	neg	I'm tired of buying garbage used, damaged, defective, manufacturer screwed up devices that are advertised as new
562	neg	Every single order I get used, damaged crap and I have to screw around for a return
562	neg	Reporting criminal practices to the FTC

563	neg	I mean, right out of the box two lights aren't working
563	neg	Luckily I bought a 4 year protection plan so asurion can look forward to all of the replacements since Logitech can't maintain quality in their production
564	pos	I must startby I love this mouse when it was working
564	pos	After only a few months and limited play on D2 my left and right mouse buttons aren't registering, switches died
564	pos	I filed a warranty claim weeks ago and convenient get it's out of stock on the warranty side but I can buy a brand new one from them no problems
564	pos	I was excited to buy logitech but after this will not any longer
564	pos	Maybe my experience is a one off but I hate when prior customers get the shaft for new ones
565	pos	I got this mouse after being fed up with my cheap o wireless mouse having dead batteries frequently and poor connection more often than acceptable
565	pos	Wow, this mouse is really a great improvement
565	pos	Feels great in my hand, very responsive, great for the games I play, many different buttons to click and program
565	pos	Even has extra weights you can attach to make it heavier
565	pos	I do recommend
566	pos	This is the first quality mouse, i've ever owned
566	pos	Compared to all my other mouses, mice, mouse plural, It's like night and day
566	pos	PRO: joy to use
566	pos	solid, heavy, a criteria we people over 30 enjoy
566	pos	CON: it's not greatly ergonomic, and i'm sure this isn't the best mouse, but as a start into the area of quality, it is good
566	pos	if it breaks within a year, i'm giving it a 1 star
566	pos	but so far it is ok
566	pos	I am a game developer and 3d modeler and youtuber the edits my own videos
566	pos	I actually kept it in the box waiting for my new computer, but the graphics card crash where there's none to be found has delayed it
566	pos	So i broke it out and put it on my laptop
566	pos	I much needed joy to use
566	pos	my laptop is horrible
567	pos	You have to download G Hub to change stuff like the LED logo color, the default is a fading rainbow light
567	pos	Every time I restart my computer it resets everything
567	pos	I have to go in to G Hub every time to change it
567	pos	The mouse's middle button/wheel feels really weird, almost clunky and a bit noisy
567	pos	The weights are ok
568	pos	I just switched from Xbox to PC and this was the first mouse I purchased
568	pos	I knew I was gonna struggle with finding all the keys so I wanted a mouse that had enough extra buttons to help me
568	pos	It definitely has helped a lot
568	pos	The placement of them is great
568	pos	I also love how you can add weights
568	pos	The braiding cable is very nice
568	pos	The only negative I have found is the RGB lights kind of stink but I didn’t buy it bc of the RGB, I bought it for every other reason
569	pos	I bought this because it is supposed to be good for people with larger hands
569	pos	Its size is about the same as other mice, so thats a bust
569	pos	Out of the box the wheel feels like its too close to the palm of my hand
569	pos	The click/no-click feature on the wheel is nice
569	pos	The weights seem a bit iffy in placement
569	pos	I'll update after I have some use-time on it
570	pos	This mouse is pretty cool
570	pos	I do not use it for gaming, but rather for work (using a cad software)
570	pos	The mouse buttons are completely customizable and uses a Logitech application for easy customization
570	pos	It does get caught up small crumbs on my desk, but I haven’t seen a mouse that doesn’t
570	pos	My favorite feature by far is the unlocking scroll wheel
570	pos	This feature has really come in handy when scrolling in and out of projects for an easier view
571	pos	This is my second one
571	pos	the first lasted somewhere right around three years until the toddler decided to beat it up one day and then it started clicking weird
571	pos	So I bought another one
571	pos	It's hard to find a gaming mouse for smaller hands, but this one accommodates and works well with a fingertip grip style
572	neg	Are you kidding me
572	neg	It came without the weights
572	neg	Like, it's one of the main features of this mouse and it came without them
572	neg	And on top of that it looks used
572	neg	I can totally tell by the bottom glides
572	neg	Come on man
572	neg	>:(Review update: I just researched a bit more and I can now confirm that it is a used mouse
572	neg	I watch an unboxing video and it's supposed to come with a semi hard plastic wrap protection AND THE MANUAL of course, guess what, mine didn'tcome with any of that, it was just the bare mouse inside the box
572	neg	Complete scam
573	neg	Always seemed to have an issue where any variation of pressure on the left click and hold of the left mouse button would cause the button to reclick causing problem with selecting text
573	neg	Support had me troubleshoot and then blamed Microsoft
573	neg	Using a different mouse now
573	neg	Problem got worse just after the warranty period
573	neg	I see lots of complaints about the micro switches regarding these mice
573	neg	I would recommend you not buy this one, or if you do once you notice the issue start to happen submit a warranty claim
574	pos	I play about 10hrs a week on average,  so kind of casual gamer
574	pos	I needed something with more buttons for Outriders and Destiny 2
574	pos	The one bummer is the program that is for button configuration is super tiny, like minuscule,  on my laptop screen and as far as I can tell it can't be adjusted
574	pos	Hard it see what I'm keying in
575	pos	The mouse is very good
575	pos	It has good build quality, good sensor, and an excellent scroll wheel
575	pos	But, after using it for one day, the blue light turned very pale blue and it is almost white
575	pos	I am on a Chromebook, so I can not change the color of the light to be a different color, because Logitech G Hub is only for Windows and Mac
576	neg	I bought this mouse about six months ago and overall I was pretty content with it at first
576	neg	The build quality seems good, the rubberized grips on the sides are nice, no issues with registration of movement, no issues of cable fraying and no issues with MOST of the buttons
576	neg	The biggest problem is that the button that DOES have an issue is the most important one: The Left-Click button
576	neg	As of the past two months I intermittently (and more frequently) encounter an issue when trying to left-click or hold left-click, the mouse registers several left-clicks in rapid succession
576	neg	You can only imagine how incredibly aggravating that is from a gameplay perspective down to something as simple as trying to drag a window across my screen only to have it drop the window and open a bunch of new tabs and randomly select everything
576	neg	It's a shame because I know many people who speak very highly of this mouse, but little did I know that this is actually a common issue that I must have overlooked when researching this mouse
576	neg	After looking into it, it seems like there are a lot of people who have reported this issue which makes me question if RMA'ing will even solve the problem or just prolong the inevitable
576	neg	I really wanted to rate this mouse much higher but because of this one critical issue with arguably the most important function of any mouse, I simply can't
577	pos	Size wise it's a tad small compared to my corsair
577	pos	The extra buttons are positioned in spots where you normally rest your finger so prepare for accidental clicks
577	pos	My chief complaint is the wheel, the dpi on that is insane, and it's sensitivity is way off simultaneously too slow and too fast
577	pos	the added bonus of course is any pressure at all will make it spin forever
577	pos	I'd keep shopping
578	pos	I honestly never thought I'd need to spend over $40 on a mouse
578	pos	The Hero has proven me wrong
578	pos	I truly did not understand how poor the mouse I had for about 4 years, which I had also bought off Amazon, had been treating me until I held the Hero in my hands
578	pos	I personally use 2 of the weights, one on the back and one on the front
578	pos	This makes moving the mouse side to side a breeze, and moving it up and down take just a few grams more effort, which is ideal for shooters and other games
578	pos	My $6 mouse functioned fine, and still does, but does not have the tactile feel, profile options, macro abilities, and even the DPI settings that it have just don't feel nearly as good as the Hero does
578	pos	Overall, would and probably will buy again
579	pos	This is a great gaming mouse
579	pos	The 25k dpi sensor is really nice to use
579	pos	Keep this in mind though, I have a Razer Basilisk V1, that was my daily driver before this
579	pos	The Razer Basilisk has a 16k sensor, there was little difference but it was not really noticeable
579	pos	(I am also not an extreme gamer, people who are professional/enthusiast gamers might notice a difference in speed)
580	pos	This mouse is honestly great
580	pos	The feel of it, the looks, and the smoothness of it, I’m just glad this exists
580	pos	The only think bad is that I sometimes bump the two buttons near the left click
580	pos	I had to Disable those two buttons in G hub
580	pos	I think that’s what it’s called
580	pos	I had them set to change dpi (which wasn’t a good idea in the first place) but quickly had to disable them
580	pos	Right now, I don’t have any problems with it
580	pos	Idk if there’s a placebo effect but I’m doing better in my Overwatch games
580	pos	Who knows
580	pos	Maybe I’ll finally hit Grandmaster again
581	neg	Both switches failed after few months and now randomly double clicking and cannot drag and drop
581	neg	I have cheap mice working for years and never had this issue
582	pos	I really like this one
582	pos	It's my second one as I wore out the first one
582	pos	Wore out the texture of the grip and finally wore out the scroll wheel on the first one
582	pos	I like the adjustable weights, I like a heavy mouse
583	neg	I play games at a competetive level
583	neg	As a woman, I also have small hands and need a smaller mouse
583	neg	This is a bit big, but it's very useable in terms of size
583	neg	However, it is absolutely awful
583	neg	It double clicks over 50% of the time on it's own
583	neg	I've tried and tried to look at calibrating it and adjusting the speed and such, but nothing fixes this
583	neg	It's unusable like this
583	neg	I can't even highlight text or use it in office applications, much less for games
583	neg	I really wanted it to work well, too
584	neg	If you want a mouse that is super comfortable but dies after 4 months, then this is the mouse for you
584	neg	A chronic problem that has plagued this version of Logitech mice since the g500 is still a thing
584	neg	After about 4 months the switch for the right or left click goes bad (it's seemingly random, in my case it was left click)
584	neg	When it goes bad it will randomly double click
584	neg	This means simple tasks like drag and drop are impossible
585	pos	I don't know why, but the product I got from Amazon was so much better than the faulty one I got from Logitech's actual website
585	pos	Very responsive and the right mb ACTUALLY WORKS PROPERLY
585	pos	It's a bit too large for my hands, but I got used to it over time
585	pos	What's important for me is the functional support that the buttons have since they're great for mmos and general desk work efficiency
585	pos	The buttons are placed comfortably so you can reach them without difficulty, and you naturally form muscle memory on their location over time
585	pos	I legit can't go back to regular mice because it's made work and gaming SO flippin easy and comfy
585	pos	Wonderful product
585	pos	Try to get this on sale whenever possible
586	pos	I bought this to replace a cheap mouse bundled in with a prebuilt PC and it has exceeded my expectations for the price
586	pos	The side button and multiple sensitivity settings make all the difference when gaming
586	pos	In Gears 5 my side buttons are set to melee and sniper zoom, and in Warzone they're set to crouch/prone
586	pos	These key binds greatly alleviated hand cramping from having to move my thumb and pinky finger below the movement keys and helped smooth out movement in intense firefights
586	pos	Also worth mentioning that the build quality is nice
586	pos	It feels very sturdy unlike the supplied mouse I did away with
587	pos	Had to get a new mouse after my g303 bit the dust, and this one was recommended to me
587	pos	So far it works very well, and it fits wonderfully in my hand
587	pos	I haven't tried the little weights it comes with, but it's a neat feature nonetheless
587	pos	Note to anyone buying this, the driver link supplied in the user manual no longer works
587	pos	You'll need to download the G-Hub software from Logitech's site, that seems to be their all-purpose driver software for newer products
588	neg	I have a regular Logitech g502 and its working great still just rubber is wearing out
588	neg	but I purchased this hero to replace my g502(non hero) and 10 minutes later im using my old 502 again after trying this I don't know if they sold me a lemon or defective unit because it has never worked properly even with software download it double clicks all time when I want to single slick and I try to drag anything and it goes berserk clicking and opening other tabs
588	neg	should have returned it but im lazy and threw box out thinking that it would just work fine like old model
588	neg	so good luck if u buy this maybe I just got a bad one
588	neg	guess it could happen
589	neg	This mouse is okay if you won’t use the wheel
589	neg	It’s either to hard to turn quickly or you hit the “release” to make it smooth and it rolls back a click or two when you stop it
589	neg	The wheel button is just as bad
589	neg	If you just press down naturally, it mostly doesn’t take the click even though you hear and feel a click
589	neg	You have to push down slightly inward toward your palm
589	neg	Then it’s a different click that actually works
589	neg	Been gaming for decades and bought this for my work PC which i use for gaming while I wait for traffic to die down (is almost as good as my home gaming rig)
589	neg	Gonna have to get a different one
589	neg	Other than the wheel, it’s a tad small but is comfortable enough for 8 hours of PC work
589	neg	Slides good
589	neg	Good for the low cost if you don’t need the wheel
590	pos	Pros: for gaming, ergonomic, good quality, modifiable with the 5 included 3
590	pos	6 g weights, color changing button, scroll button lock/unlockCons: lights flash all the time, not for large hands (I have to bend my fingers to hit the curious buttons because my hand is bigger than the mouse)
591	pos	I've had this mouse for 1 yr and 2 months with about 6-10 hrs of use on weekdays and 12-18 hrs of use on weekends for both browsing and gaming (1st person shooters + MMOs)
591	pos	It still looks and works perfectly as on day 1
591	pos	- I absolutely love the left/right tilt on the scroll wheel, which works even for going back/forward a page while browsing or fast forwarding/rewinding a video
591	pos	- Easy to clean with no dead skin cell buildup on the rubber parts (just wipe it down every other week)
591	pos	The only con is my thumb can't reach the side button very well, but then again, I use a palm grip with half my palm on the desk
592	pos	Looks and feels great
592	pos	The scroll wheel was very smooth, but not quite as smooth as the MX Master
592	pos	Very aggressive look which comes with tons of features while still having flawless ergonomics
592	pos	I would recommend this mouse to anyone that needs a wireless gaming mouse
592	pos	The button to slow dpi is also very useful and if not you can change it to whatever you need it to be
593	pos	This mouse is really really awesome, it's pricey for a mouse but if you're a programmer, gamer or someone else who uses a computer for a long time it's WELL worth the price
593	pos	I love the adjustable weighting, it's large and feels very well made
593	pos	All the buttons are remappable, and the metal scroll wheel is just so much fun
593	pos	I bought a 2nd one for my desktop at my mom's, and considering getting a wireless one for my laptop
594	pos	I have had 2 of these and after about 6 months to a year they just start to double click or do whatever it wants to do
594	pos	I know buy Razor and have very little or no problem with them for only a few $ more
595	neg	I had the older 502's and used them for years, loved them never issue
595	neg	Had to replace after a few years because of mouse feet and rubber grip being chewed by thumb, no big deal
595	neg	I upgraded to 502 Hero
595	neg	I played a TON of FPS, thousands and thousands of hours over the last decade
595	neg	Anyway right clicking eventually failed and you cannot hold it down
595	neg	Aiming down sights or clicking and dragging is impossible
595	neg	This occurred after about 3 months of use
595	neg	I went on to buy 3 total of these mice, replacing them every few months because the same critical right clicking failure would resurface after 2-4 months
595	neg	I got one in March and its already ruined and unusable
595	neg	Cannot play any games or even perform basic functions
595	neg	I would stay FAR away from this mouse as its lifespan is a few months
595	neg	I have finally made the switch to a new brand and likely wont return
595	neg	This is truly pathetic from a company that used to be one of the best in the industry; incredibly disappointing
596	pos	You cannot go wrong with this mouse if you are used to a bit heavy mice
596	pos	Allows varying dpi's adjustable as per your requirements
596	pos	Extra buttons on the mouse for back and forward functions
596	pos	And additional clickable keys on the side for gaming
596	pos	Using it for csgo and looks cool with its rgb
596	pos	My favorite is the scroll as its quite accurate compared my old mouse was quite irritating
597	pos	This mouse is amazing, basically it’s the only mouse you need when you want to improve your gaming skills
597	pos	Takes time to adjust your sensitivity (dpi) but when you get it in the right settings ñ, you’ll destroy your enemy with breathtaking flicks onto their heads
597	pos	Headshots if you didn’t get that
597	pos	Now you need to download Logitech’s app for the mouse configurations, also color customizable
597	pos	Comfortable and slickA lot of buttons where you can also customize and make shortcuts with one click on your mouseThis mouse is worth it, it’s all I can say
598	pos	Son loves all things it can do
598	pos	I used it once when I needed to borrow his pc and it was comfortable and I have small hands
598	pos	He says it’s comfortable and has much bigger hands
598	pos	It has a lot of options like weights you can add to the bottom if you want a heavier mouse
598	pos	I just need a mouse that I can point and click
598	pos	Can’t elaborate on the functions but I can promise if they DIDNT work I would know
598	pos	He can be picky
598	pos	Not a single complaint about this mouse
599	pos	Extremely smooth on just about any surface
599	pos	I like how easy it is to adjust the weights
599	pos	The weigh cover is on the bottom and is magnetic
599	pos	Playing Cod with this mouse enhanced my play style my average kills went from 21 kills per game to an easy 30+
599	pos	The dpi shift button is pretty cool and kinda useful
599	pos	The mouse wheel has a left click and right click function  and has the ability to be free flowing or not
599	pos	I'll post videos after my wife births our child wish me luck lol
600	pos	I originally purchased the Logitech MS Master 2S wireless mouse but ended up returning that one due to connectivity issues
600	pos	This replacement works so much better
600	pos	Even though I'm not a gamer, I like how the mouse feels (very ergonomic with a nice weight to it), and am looking forward to exploring the different programmable functions in the G Hub software
600	pos	Really happy with the design, feel, customization, and responsiveness of this product
601	pos	Had been on the fence about getting a new mouse and I have to say I'm loving this one, I put the maximum amount of weight it lets and I'm enjoying the scroll wheel ( you and have it unlocked so it will fast scroll)
602	neg	my g502 hero didn't start double clicking until roughly half a year of using it
602	neg	Most clicks are double clicks now
602	neg	other than that, this mouse has a very unique scroll wheel design
602	neg	The ability to switch between a infinite scroll wheel and other regular type seems like a rare/one-of-a-kind design
602	neg	iv used a few dozen different mouses, and for some reason no other mouse can have this design
602	neg	g502 scroll wheel might dunk on every other mouse scroll wheel in the world
602	neg	but the mouse cant go a year without double clicking regularly
602	neg	the absolute top tier scroll wheel with a bottom tier right/ left trigger
602	neg	Other that, this is generally a heavy mouse with alot of other average characteristics
602	neg	I never installed any software to get it to work
603	pos	The mouse works great
603	pos	the easy to click dpi mode buttons are nice
603	pos	It would make more sense to only have 1 button for that and an extra M button, but it's still a great product
603	pos	I initially went with another (Substantial gaming company) brand, and it was a complete failure due to it's lack of drivers and working software
603	pos	I don't know what I was thinking, not going with logitech for any IO device
603	pos	PS:  I have tiny hands and can still reach all the buttons comfortably
604	neg	Mouse was great but started to not register clicks and even "release" the click although I was still holding it down
604	neg	Went through customer support and got a replacement pretty quickly with minimal effort (that's why I gave it a extra star) but the replacement developed the same issue after about a week
605	neg	Great mouse quality, incredible accurate, if heavy mouses arent for you dont even think about this
605	neg	The mouse alone is heavy
605	neg	I tried full weigth (with all the little 3
605	neg	6grams weigths)  and my hand got tired after 2h gaming
605	neg	Removed the weigths and its perfect
605	neg	(EDIT) THE WHEEL STARTED FAILING AFTER 2 MONTHS
605	neg	WHEN U SCROLL IT SOMETIME RANDOMLY STARTS ACTIVATING THE OTHER 2 HOTCKEYS
605	neg	UPDATE: 6 months after normal use (around 2-3h per day)  the ghost clicking hell started
605	neg	Just avoid this mouse and get something else not from logitech
606	pos	Great build quality, feels so natural when your holding it
606	pos	I have bigger hands and it's a dream
606	pos	I do have a two issues with it though
606	pos	👎 "Sniper" button doesn't work whatsoever
606	pos	Maybe every once in awhile when I first owned it (a few months now)👎The mouse wheel clicks left and right, adding 2 more buttons to it
606	pos	In the heat of the moment when your not exactly paying attention and just going hard, you WILL click left or right and do something you were not expecting
606	pos	It's cost me plenty of gamesGood mouse, good everything
606	pos	Just not for me
607	neg	Broke right away, you can't even use the right mouse button
607	neg	The selector input lever to detect your mice button clicks will either read no clicking or multiple clicks
607	neg	It makes precision almost impossible because of constant re-attempting to make sure the click was registered
607	neg	The frustration of this mouse cannot be expressed through written word and I encourage anyone who actually uses a mouse to stay clear from this
607	neg	I purchased this based on amazon ratings which must be advertisements because once I started having this issue and doing some legit research I soon found out there are many other people suffering from this defective piece of junk
607	neg	At this point I'm suspect of all logitec products
608	neg	Had to turn this mouse
608	neg	Excited when I received it but after trying for near 3 hours to program the mouse buttons for regular use, in had to give up
608	neg	Might do well for games but I just wanted it for regular use and everyday use buttons
608	neg	Looks really nice though
608	neg	RETURNED the same day
609	pos	So far the functionality and feel of this mouse are amazing
609	pos	I love everything about it
609	pos	My only problem is that the primary lighting function came in defective and does not turn on
609	pos	I tried going through Logitech G Hub to turn it on but its at 100% brightness and still does not turn on
609	pos	Only the Logo lighting works
609	pos	Not a problem with functionality, just aesthetics
610	pos	Soo I bought this for black Friday and I gotta say I'm disappointed
610	pos	It took over a week to arrive (with prime) and when I got it it worked fine, however on like the 3rd er 4th day using it it would move up or down infinitely without me touching it or just stop sensing the movement
610	pos	The buttons still worked but when I'd move the mouse it wouldnt do anything
610	pos	And so I unplugged it and plugged it in a different USB port which temporarily fixed it but it still keeps doing it
610	pos	It just stops mid game or which is very frustrating especially in fast paced games where seconds count
610	pos	Idk what to do about but I gotta say it's annoying as hell and I know it isn't the system because I plugged in a different mouse and it worked fine for 2 days and then I plugged the g502 in it just didnt register any movement
611	pos	Excellent mouse, as advertised with no hardware issues
611	pos	However, Logitech's G Hub software is a dumpster fire of an application
611	pos	Logitech pushes updates that break the app itself or hardware functionality (like not registering left clicks)
611	pos	Background cpu usage is upwards of 15% on a Ryzen 3600 system
611	pos	G Hub feels like an alpha release and Logitech hasn't be able to improve stability or app performance since they released G Hub back in February 2019
611	pos	Yes, thats 7 months of garbage software support for their flagship hardware products
611	pos	Save yourself the pain and DO NOT DOWNLOAD G HUB
611	pos	The fix is to use the legacy 'Logitech Gaming Software' which is still available and does include support for the 502 Hero
611	pos	I'm using the LGS 9
611	pos	02
611	pos	65 release hosted on TechSpot and have no issues
611	pos	LGS supports button rebinding as well as LED color control in a reliable fashion, unlike G Hub
611	pos	This would be an easy 5 star review but in 2019 I should not be forced to use legacy software to ensure my hardware functions properly
612	pos	I use it on my recliner, works great
612	pos	Only thing is, as a gamer you want your computer empty
612	pos	Why do you have to download software
612	pos	Haven't they figured it out yet
612	pos	Anyhow , I ended up deleting the software and let the thing change colors
612	pos	I have plenty of space, and want to keep it that way
612	pos	Just more stuff running in the background
612	pos	But I still love this mouse
613	neg	Pretty upset that the product isnt lasting as long as the manufacturer claims
613	neg	I hardly play a lot of games and dont play any FPS or games that require a lot of clicking and the Left click is now useless
613	neg	I cant click and hold anything without it unselecting randomly
614	neg	I've had the mouse for a month or two now, and I am now repeatedly getting a problem where the primary mouse button won't drag click properly
614	neg	Do some googling, and it's become a common problem
614	neg	TL:DR - this mouse will break on you, it'll happen right about 3 months in which is when I had discarded the packaging
614	neg	Save the $50
615	pos	Amazing upgrade from G402 model best mouse at a fair price
615	pos	Easily trumps any mouse on the market in my opinion
615	pos	DPI is awesomeParacorded anti tangle wire(not the old school rubber/plastic)Additional buttons from g402 (11 total)more comfortable in handbetter feel overall I have very big hand perfect fit11 customizable buttons/actions (via GHUB) software from manufacturer website, customized rbg lighting
615	pos	No Cons all Pros
616	pos	First off, aside from the scroll wheel issue that I am encountering (and others are encountering), this is the best gaming mouse I've ever owned
616	pos	Very ergonomic and the modular weight system is awesome
616	pos	The problem I'm having is the loose scroll wheel
616	pos	When flicking the mouse left and right you can feel the scroll wheel hitting the sides of the mouse and it is very distracting both from a feel standpoint and the audible clicking noise it makes
616	pos	It is absolutely terrible in freewheel mode where it spins forever but even in the locked mode you can still feel it and it is still audible
616	pos	Not sure how logitec can overlook this
616	pos	As I said great mouse beside this but this is a dealbreaker
616	pos	I will have to return this product
617	pos	I ordered another mouse and could not find the interface to customize it
617	pos	Soooo  I ordered this one and will be returning the other one
617	pos	Took me just a few minutes to figure out the interface and off and going with the computer stuff that I do
617	pos	This is MORE then a gaming mouse
618	pos	I should've bought this mouse a long time ago
618	pos	This mouse is great
618	pos	Plenty of customization and hardware profiles can be loaded if you want to avoid software for things like RGB
618	pos	Build quality is great, design is a little edgy but still doesn't scream 'gamer'
618	pos	Infinity Wheel is surprisingly handy, I notice myself using it more and more
618	pos	If you want a high performance mouse that won't break the bank while looking good, this is the mouse for you
619	neg	Highly tempting to add to your Logitech arsenal
619	neg	Although this is a gaming mouse with good looks and features with RGB and weight adjustments, it may not last
619	neg	This is the second 502 i owned and did not learn from my mistakes
619	neg	The first one had left double click problems, and this one registers left mouse down correctly however left mouse up is involuntary
619	neg	I bought this only 5 months ago
619	neg	I have contacted Logitech support, waiting for their response
619	neg	Edit: Bumping up to 2 stars
619	neg	After back and forth with Logitech support for a couple of weeks, they agreed to send me a replacement
619	neg	Note: No matter how hard you try to convince Logitech support, they will need a video evidence with your mouse in action on the screen
620	neg	Was using a trash $20 gaming mouse, decided to upgrade to this due to the good reviews but I actually hate it
620	neg	Where your thumb rests there is some huge plastic piece that comes out of the side that digs into it and is unbearable (noted I'm 5'8 and don't have huge hands or anything), there are zero ways to use the mouse comfortably
620	neg	The scroll wheel is far too fast and even with all the weights in it still seems light and cheap
620	neg	Used it for about 2 minutes then put it back in the box to collect dust in the closet, thanks logitech :)
621	pos	The mouse itself works well and it is a good choice for everyday use and gaming
621	pos	I love its shape and its breathing LED design, which makes it feel like a sense of technology
621	pos	It is enjoyable to click the mouse
621	pos	But I do find this mouse not fit me that much
621	pos	The resistance of the wheel is too large for me
621	pos	It has some sort of tearing sound apart from the rolling sound when I use the wheel
621	pos	Too many buttons are designed near the thumb and I did accidentally push these buttons when playing the game
621	pos	The worst design in my mind is its antislip surface on two sides
621	pos	The concavity is too obvious and my two fingers which touch two sides feel uncomfortable for a long time use
621	pos	Also it easily cumulates some dirt
622	pos	I find this mouse to be lightweight, but not too lightweight that it feels like it could just slide excessively or more than needed
622	pos	The adjustable scroll wheel option is such an amazing feature
622	pos	I most definitely wish they had more color choices like pink
622	pos	😆
623	pos	I have been using a logitech G500 mouse for years and thought maybe its time for a replacement
623	pos	Since I loved the G500 so much naturally I thought I'd get another logitech mouse
623	pos	I thought the ergonomics would be the same and the weight system would be similar
623	pos	Well I was mistaken you can't get exact same weight as you could with the G500 and the weights aren't interchangeable so Im stuck at a lighter weight then I normally like, not the biggest issue
623	pos	The biggest issue for me is it feels noticeably smaller in my hand making more uncomfortable to use
623	pos	Logitech if you read this bring back the G500, like the one pictured
623	pos	with the newer tech, please
624	neg	So I got the mouse today and the first thing i noticed is the box on the right side was kinda dented in a little
624	neg	and the top left where you open the mouse was a little tattered
624	neg	I didn't have time to open it till around 3 hours later and to my shocking surprise when i was putting the weights the pads seemed like they were used as well as there was dirt stuck on the corners of the pads
624	neg	as well as there was a little almost melted type plastic on the bottom of the mouse
624	neg	I have asked for a refund as well as provided the pictures here for everyone to see
624	neg	This is just unacceptable
624	neg	I will change the rating after i receive what i hope is a brand new mouse
625	pos	Fantastic mouse
625	pos	As a PC gamer with 16 yrs on steam, and many more before that, this mouse is great for me
625	pos	Having the option to lock and unlock the scroll button from free spinning to notched is a great touch
625	pos	My only slight, baby, minor complaint is no pinky rest
625	pos	Don't care though, great mouse
625	pos	Software is unobtrusive and minimalistic but encompassing
625	pos	Love it
625	pos	New favorite
626	neg	It works fine when the scroll wheel isn't broken
626	neg	The first one lasted less than a month
626	neg	I ordered another one and the scroll wheel literally broke in the first hour of use
626	neg	Avoid
627	neg	Just Google "G502 double click" to see how common this problem is
627	neg	After 1-2 years, your left-click (and sometimes right click) will start double clicking automatically some of the time (because the switches are of poor quality)
627	neg	That will make the mouse really annoying to use, as it basically behaves unpredictably when you're clicking/dragging
627	neg	The fixes you'll find on Reddit only work temporarily (like for a few hours at a time)
627	neg	The low price is not so great if you end up buying a new one every year
628	pos	Solid construction, simple easy to use software
628	pos	Solid metal scroll wheel is nice and the endless free scroll feature takes a little getting used to but is very nice once you do
628	pos	I like that there is no rubber "tire" on the scroll wheel to deteriorate or come loose
629	pos	The mouse itself is good, lots of extra buttons, responsive, and weighted but all that is the good
629	pos	now for the bad, the G-Hub doesn't work
629	pos	I have 18 games that are suppose to be "Automatically added" or Scanned that didn't work, so now I have to set up my own profiles that is tedious
629	pos	Its almost like they spent all their money on the mouse and video telling how cool it ism but the software sucks and hinders like 85% of usability
629	pos	FIX YOUR ISSUES LOGITECH
630	pos	I like this mouse so far, the ergonomics work well for a "gaming" mouse
630	pos	My only minor complaints are 2 things: I don't like having to download software to adjust or disable the stupid rgb and set button bindings
630	pos	I also would like some feedback on the scroll wheel (not sure if mine is defective, but it seems designed this way) it spins freely, if you want to hold a position or only scroll 1 or 2 lines its somewhat annoying
630	pos	You can spin the wheel and it keeps going for a few seconds on its own momentum
631	pos	This mouse works great
631	pos	The only issue I have is that the software for configuring the mouse prevents my laptop from going to sleep
631	pos	Not sure if this is an ASUS specific issue or more wide spread
631	pos	Just make sure to close the software from the system tray
632	pos	I have relatively small hands, and this mouse is a perfect fit for me
632	pos	No wrist pain at all
632	pos	The multiple buttons are really nice to have especially for gaming
632	pos	In terms of functionality, I haven’t had any problems with it
632	pos	It does what I need it to do without fail
632	pos	Only “complaint” which isn’t really a complaint because it doesn’t bother me that much, would be the metal scroll wheel getting cold or having some mild slip while using it
632	pos	Other than that this mouse is perfect for me
633	pos	mouse was excellent until the left click failed(click and drag won't work/random double clicks), I also really liked the added weights as i got big goofy hands
633	pos	The quality of the mouse was so good, that even though it;s now broken, I'd still give it 3 stars
633	pos	I've had mice at 1/10th the cost last a decade but this didnt last 3 years
633	pos	Used for light gaming (no e-sports titles or competitive shooters) and studio work
633	pos	Also a slap in the face that a mouse this expensive with clear durability issues not having a longer warranty
634	neg	I've had 4 of these
634	neg	They all end up double clicking when you only try to click once
634	neg	Really annoying in every game
634	neg	You think, "oh that shouldn't matter in rpg games"
634	neg	It does you end up trying to pick up items in your inventory and just put them right back
634	neg	Over and over
634	neg	Oh and forget clicking dialogue
634	neg	It gets in the way of work too
634	neg	Believe me
634	neg	Stay away from this mouse
635	neg	I've owned this mouse for 1 year and 1 month
635	neg	I bought this back on January 30, 2019 and now it double clicks
635	neg	This is the 2nd "gaming" Logitech mouse I've bought that has this problem
635	neg	Very disappointed as this mouse felt great, and I loved the scroll wheel
635	neg	I would understand if it double clicked due to extensive use due to playing high value clicking games such as, Starcraft or Dota
635	neg	But all I play is strategy games which require minimal clicking such as Warhammer total war, or HOI4
636	neg	Right mouse button began double clicking on its own after 2 months of use
636	neg	I play FPS games
636	neg	I'd hold the button to aim and the button would act as if I let go of it then back to aiming
636	neg	I emailed Logitech support and they had me go through 5 different steps to troubleshoot
636	neg	After going through everything it still didn't fix the issue
636	neg	They then asked me for some info including a video of me using an online program to prove the mouse was double clicking
636	neg	After doing everything they asked for I haven't heard from them since
636	neg	It's a great mouse and very comfortable but maybe I got unlucky with this one
636	neg	Not happy with customer service not answering my emails anymore either
636	neg	Waste of $50
637	pos	I had an OG 502 for ages and only realized that it was far too big for my hands when I switched to a G703
637	pos	Which actually says a lot about the quality of a mouse even when it doesn't fit me quite right
637	pos	The 703 had the double click issue and fell apart within a year so I switched to the new model of the 502, it's still a sturdy great mouse and it's served me well
637	pos	However, if you use a fingertip grip or have smaller hands like I do then you're going to want something else, unless you have huge hands
638	neg	The USER Interface is difficult to use
638	neg	The WORST MOUSE Logitech has made in 10 years
638	neg	I have had over 8-9 mice from LOGITECH, this is a turd
638	neg	The mouse is TOO NARROW
638	neg	I just lost a Game online because This meece DOES NOT use The Microsoft SETTINGS
639	neg	I was disappointed with this mouse
639	neg	The scroll wheel has two modes, free spin which is basically unusable for anything and the locked state which is too slow and makes a loud noise
639	neg	The mouse click also requires very little pressure so I accidentally click with it
639	neg	I’m going back to my cheaper Logitech mouse which doesn’t make a loud scrolling sound and is smoother
640	pos	I previously had a G500s for over 5 years which was awesome and worked super well for me over hundreds of hours of shooters, strategy games and productivity tasks
640	pos	I finally decided it was time to upgrade/replace, and this mouse feels amazing
640	pos	The very slidy teflon feet, which allow the G502 HERO to slide much faster than the G500s make the mouse seem faster and more responsive, even at the same DPI
640	pos	The new sensor feels very snappy and precise and allows for very fine movements that the G500s wasn't as accurate at capturing
640	pos	My only complaint is the slightly smaller overall footprint of the mouse
640	pos	As a large-ish handed person I liked how the G500s filled up my whole palm, whereas the G502 falls a little short
640	pos	This is something i am rapidly getting used to though, and I think my in game performance is unaffected by the move to this new mouse, and will probably even improve once I am done adjusting
640	pos	Love Logitech products and am yet to be disappointed
641	neg	This mouse, like many others, uses the cheap Omron switch
641	neg	These switches fail very quickly and very often
641	neg	Unfortunately, my mouse also failed within about 6 months of use
641	neg	This is a shame because everything else about the mouse is great
641	neg	I love using it, but it makes gaming and general productivity take a nose-dive when it struggles with the double-click/click-drag issue
641	neg	I'm currently looking for a replacement
642	pos	I'm going to start by saying almost all my peripherals are logitech, and this is the 5th or 6th logi mouse I've owned, and I have never had one fail so quickly
642	pos	In less than a year the left click button was registering 2-3 clicks when I would click once, and if I tried to hold the button down there's a good chance it will start clicking instead of holding
642	pos	I've already started a claim on it but I would really expect better from logitech
642	pos	I'm really hoping that they get better switches in the future
642	pos	Aside from that, it's great, aside from the failure I can easily say I like the comfort, looks, and ease of programming the buttons and functions on this mouse
643	neg	This mouse was great for a year and nine months
643	neg	Now it jumps around when gaming, won't allow me to properly control characters
643	neg	Instead of instantaneously resizing windows it now takes many seconds as it unwillingly "releases" the window while dragging the edges and suddenly maximizes windows without prompt or warning when dragging the edges
643	neg	I can no longer highlight words using the mouse, a very basic yet important feature
643	neg	The manufacturer offered a firmware upgrade but I noticed little difference
643	neg	I will look at other brands before Logitech in the future when buying a mouse
643	neg	I do not recommend Logitech, if you're looking for a mouse look elsewhere
644	pos	It gets the job done, and at a pretty good price
644	pos	Im not one for rgb, but it has that and it is somewhat customizible
644	pos	It has weights that can be removed
644	pos	I think that the click made by the mouse is a bit anoying, but have dealt with much worse
644	pos	It does occasionally double click or I accidentally click the secondary buttons, but that is probably more due to the fact that I am not used to those secondary buttons even existing
644	pos	If you need a buget mouse for gaming that wont break the bank, I would say that this is a pretty decent choice
645	neg	I really like the ergonomics of this mouse and the features
645	neg	It's got an adjustable to let you set your preference, and you can switch cursor speed quickly on the mouse itself
645	neg	However, there's a major flaw in the design of LMB that makes this mouse incredibly frustrating to use
645	neg	The switch in the LMB will occasionally get in to a state where it registers single clicks as multiple clicks and registers many clicks while holding the button down
645	neg	This only gets worse over time, and there's no workaround for it
645	neg	It seems that this is a common issue with this mouse's design and not a one-off issue that is fixed with a replacement
646	neg	This is the second Logitech mouse I've bought
646	neg	I got the 502 Proteus in January 2018 and this one in July 2019
646	neg	Both have suffered from the same problem where the right mouse click starts double-tapping frequently
646	neg	I had read about this problem in other reviews but figured how bad could my luck be to get two faulty products
646	neg	Turns out my luck is pretty bad
646	neg	When it works it is a great mouse for gaming, but the reliability is not good
646	neg	I wouldn't buy this again
647	pos	I've heard about this mouse and it was on my radar for awhile
647	pos	I have no complaints and actually really like this mouse
647	pos	The shape is nice and the feel is really there
647	pos	I don't use the extra two programmable buttons placed up on the left click but it is still a great mouse
647	pos	DPI changes and the slight RGB makes it very likeable for me; also a weight adjustment if you're into that
648	neg	I bought this item in April
648	neg	I enjoyed it very much
648	neg	I noticed in the last month, however, it is starting to get touchy with the left click
648	neg	more recently I can sometimes not grab items and drag to the next monitor, it lets go randomly
648	neg	The reason I am giving this a 2 is because it seems impossible to contact their support
648	neg	Tried filing a claim on the warranty site but the 'File a Claim' button does not work
648	neg	Sends me to an infinite loop to review product information
648	neg	When I called the number I waited for about 15 minutes, robot on the phone told me to go to their website, and asked if I wanted to leave a voicemail so I did
648	neg	I will update this review as I see fit, but so far; not a good look from Logitech in my eyes
648	neg	Am on the market for a new brand of mouse
649	pos	So ima keep it 100
649	pos	when i got it it was excellent perfect feels good in my big hand nice weight
649	pos	However as of now I cant use it, it has double click issues so I cant drag and drop, I cant hold left click to shoot , the scroll wheel is unresponsive unless I click the middle part and move my mouse down or up to scroll
649	pos	i went on google to look it up and they said its a soldering issue and all of these mice have the potential to do this although I'm unlucky and murphys law was applied just for me
649	pos	I know the buttons are nice but tbh I bought it because of all these reviews for it and it did last a year I just cant give you guys a thumbs up to buy this when its got design flaws
649	pos	I'm gonna look for something else
650	pos	This is a good mouse for gaming
650	pos	Has multiple buttons
650	pos	The on mouse adjustable dpi rate is very cool
650	pos	You can click to switch from slow to fast mouse speed on the mouse
650	pos	The left and right click switches are sensitive enough you can drag click with a little practice
651	neg	DPI settings are infuriating
651	neg	If I have to yell at your mouse, it's trash
651	neg	UI for the settings is absolute garbage
651	neg	Congrats on tricking me into buying trash
651	neg	update: 2 years in and the right button is dead
651	neg	mouse is built like junk so I can't recommend
651	neg	for comparison, i have 10 year old dell mice that came free with some old pc that still work
652	pos	Easy DPI settings adjustment
652	pos	Software required to change colors and change DPI presets, but it's not too crazy
652	pos	I really like the set of weights included, a level of mouse customization I'd never had before
652	pos	No weird double clicks or issues with any of the additional mouse buttons so far, and it's comfortable enough
653	neg	So I have a love hate relationship with this mouse
653	neg	The sensor is great
653	neg	The feel is great
653	neg	The mouse overall is everything I want
653	neg	Now for the bad part
653	neg	I bought the mouse in july and am on my 3rd mouse
653	neg	3 times now because I am not gonna return it again, the main mouse buttons have become glitchy
653	neg	To the point to where if you dont hold it down with the strength of Hercules, it starts deciding it wants to do this thing where it cant decide to be pushed down or not
653	neg	So you get this weird sort of on/off super fast
653	neg	Which being a gaming mouse is horrid
653	neg	Are you trying to ADS, well i hope you like going in and out of zoom at 400 times a minute
653	neg	Want to play a shin-obi that needs to block quickly
653	neg	Eh maybe in half a second when it decides to register the click
653	neg	This is inexcusable
653	neg	Once or twice i can maybe understand
653	neg	But for me to get three mice from logitech that all had the same problem of what I am guessing is the most bottom barrel micro switches for the right and left mouse buttons is ridiculous
653	neg	So this is a great mouse
653	neg	For about 3 weeks before it breaks
653	neg	If you arent a heavy gamer then maybe a week,
654	pos	Something about the shape just feels good
654	pos	Maybe it's the convenient thumb rest but, I love the way this mouse feels in my hand
654	pos	It is wider than most other mice and the side is curved just right, so maybe that's the reason
655	neg	I've been a long time Logitech mouse consumer
655	neg	I was in love with the 3 G500s I owned, each one lasted forever, and died with dignity
655	neg	However, this one really is just awful
655	neg	It has this horrendous double click bug, where anytime you click on something, it thinks its a double click
655	neg	It makes doing about anything impossible
655	neg	I tried to get support for this but was ignored
655	neg	And I guess warranty doesn't matter these days
655	neg	Not sure if I would ever buy a logitech product again at this point if this is how they treat customers
656	pos	My mouse gets a fair amount of usage so I wore the other one out
656	pos	The mouse fits in your hand like it was ment to fit in your hand
656	pos	It has just the right amount of buttons
656	pos	Not too many but just a few extras to be able to macro stuff to
656	pos	Very light mouse so there is weight included depending on how you like the feel of your mouse
656	pos	The DPI button is nice to be able to shift through your profiles depending on what you are doing
656	pos	I would definitely recommend this mouse especially for the price
657	neg	If you've ever joked asking where the "adult" gloves were when you need large size gloves then you will not like this mouse
657	neg	It's slightly too short length and width
657	neg	LEDs didn't work on mine either even after fiddling with the settings but I probably just got a defective one or something
657	neg	Button placements are great and the scroll wheel locked/unlocked feel great though
658	neg	Beware, ordered a new mouse and received one that had clearly already been used
658	neg	There was grime on the bottom, fingerprints on the weights, and the feet of the mouse were clearly scratched from previous use
658	neg	Unsure if it was just because mine was already used, but the mouse wheel also could move left and right, and made a distracting clicking noise
658	neg	Made this noise both when the scroll wheel was locked and unlocked
659	pos	I was having trouble with my Razer mouse (double clicks and non-responsive sometimes) and I saw that reviews of newer models had the same troubles
659	pos	I decided to take the gamble and switch to logitech
659	pos	I have no regrets
659	pos	The mouse is very comfortable in my hand and I love that the scroll wheel can be adjusted to click or scroll continuously
659	pos	It has plenty of programmable buttons and feels like it is made of high quality materials
659	pos	Glad I switched to Logitech
660	pos	It’s a great gaming mouse
660	pos	Pros:Feels great, it’s smooth, and clicks goods
660	pos	Macro is neat and handy
660	pos	Wheel lock can do some funny things in a bunch of games
660	pos	Cons:The current software program that controls everything sucks big ‘ol donkey donger
660	pos	Depending on the game the software craps it’s pants and glitches out the LEDs causing your mouse’s sensor to power down and back up
660	pos	Meaning it stutters your game to hell making you have to turn the LED off
660	pos	The two buttons, left and right wheel, really needs a stronger spring and a more pronounced click
660	pos	It’s not really something you can macro other keys to because they’re unreliable
660	pos	You need a super-flat surface to use the mouse on
660	pos	I’ve used other mice where you can have bumps, hills, and gaps on the field but still be playable but this mouse is not like those
660	pos	Needs to be smooth
661	pos	My teenage son wasn't sure about this mouse when he first got it
661	pos	It just took him a little time to figure it out but now he loves it for gaming
661	pos	We also didn't notice the weights at first that can be added or removed
662	neg	I absolutely love this mouse when it's working
662	neg	Unfortunately, it only lasts about 6 months before the primary mouse button starts to malfunction
662	neg	This is the 3rd time this has happened and seems to be typical poor Logitech quality control
662	neg	There are too many solid alternatives out there to continue down this frustrating path
662	neg	I am moving to a different manufacturer
662	neg	Done with Logitech
663	pos	lots of features and all the DPI you'll never get to use
663	pos	great for gaming
663	pos	not a bunch of buttons you gotta memorize and its rgb setting works perfect for my setup
663	pos	on the fly dpi changing and reducing button
664	neg	If you enjoy losing FPS games and experiencing endless frustration, then this is the mouse for you
664	neg	I would not recommend anyone buy this mouse
664	neg	After about 6 month of use the right mouse button goes to sh*t and experiences a double clicking issue
664	neg	If you do any FPS gaming you know this is a complete deal breaker
664	neg	You will lose any firefight your engage in
664	neg	It’s a shame because the feel of the mouse is great
664	neg	If it weren’t for this issue I’d give this mouse 5 stars, but this issue alone tanks the mouse to to 1 star
664	neg	I’d rather play on a 1990 Lenovo trackpad
664	neg	Save the money and buy something else
664	neg	I will never buy another Logitech mouse product
665	pos	The media could not be loaded
665	pos	I personally love the weights it comes with so you can fine tune the weight for your movements and adjust accordingly
665	pos	Also the ability to fine tune the sensitivity of the mouse is awesome
665	pos	You can make it super quick once you get your movements down and more accurate
666	pos	Though the look didnt originally captivate me its really come to grow on me
666	pos	The feel is excellent
666	pos	Action is smooth ( I used the weights)
666	pos	Plenty of programmable buttons and a light util you can download for free
666	pos	The scroll wheel (when you release the brake) feels like its got a fidget spinner bearing in there, weeeee, that thing spins crazy fast/long
666	pos	Anyway, im very satisfied by this mouse, and its price
666	pos	Never been disappointed with Logitech so im not too surprised
666	pos	GG Logitech, thanks
667	pos	This is my favorite gaming mouse
667	pos	I’m on my fourth one
667	pos	That said, I usually need to replace it at least once a year
667	pos	Every single Logitech mouse that I’ve owned has developed a double click issue after about a year
667	pos	Even my more expensive G903 developed this issue
667	pos	Resolving involves disassembly which requires removal of the mouse feet
667	pos	Even then, the issue will quickly reappear after a few months
668	pos	The mouse only measures 2
668	pos	5 inches wide without the thumb support jutting out the end
668	pos	It's very very thin, two of my fingers were hanging off the end of it
668	pos	The ergonomics of this mouse is tall over wide, so if you want a flat mouse this isn't for you
668	pos	The movement across my mousepad was very very smooth, when I was playing cs with it I noticed a visible difference to my aim because of it
668	pos	Only problem was I couldn't hold the mouse because it was too small
668	pos	The quality of material is exceptional, every part of it is good
668	pos	I just cant use it
668	pos	addendum: My palm is 4 inches wide and my hand is 8 1/4 inch long, so I suppose it would be difficult to have an ergonomic mouse
668	pos	if you don't have large hands buy the mouse
669	pos	Gaming: 10/10
669	pos	With all the weights in it is solid and heavy allowing you to do more accurate and careful pointing with the mouse
669	pos	Take the weights out and you’ve got a surprisingly light mouse that can whip around
669	pos	It is NOT as light as a lot of other mice, so be warned there
669	pos	I haven’t gotten any arm or wrist strain so it’s not a worry for me anyway
669	pos	General use: 10/10
669	pos	I do like the placement of the buttons on the mouse, and setting up macros and functions is easy and quick
669	pos	Overall
669	pos	Maybe $70 is a bit high, but it’s always on sale and I found a “used” one (box had a scratch in it haha) for $30
669	pos	It also looks pretty darn cool
670	pos	I love all the buttons and configurations I can set to them
670	pos	I also that I can switch sensitivity on the fly with the DPI shortcuts
670	pos	I would def recommend
670	pos	People say it's heavy but personally I like some weight to my house to be able to "feel" it
670	pos	10/10 would def buy again
670	pos	in fact i have two
670	pos	one for home and one for work, which is very helpful because I am able to program commonly used commands like copy, paste, etc
671	pos	This mouse is great, don't get me wrong, but there are some things to be weary about, and its not Logitech's fault
671	pos	To start off, the mouse looks and feels great, aside from t he fact that it is a bit small, but I have some big hands
671	pos	The back button is a little bit to far from my thumb to use it quickly, but a little bit of movement isn't gonna kill me
671	pos	The Clicks are nice and crisp, but the buttons DO TEND to press down when I don't want them to
671	pos	The thumb buttons (Back, forward, DPI up/ down, DPI shift) are a little light and get pressed down much easier than my other mouse, Bit I just need to adjust and I'll get used to it
671	pos	The infinite scroll is AMAZING, but the side clicks come with minimal force as well
671	pos	Again, I just need to adjust
671	pos	The mouse over all DID come with all of the things it needed to (Weights, Manual, actual mouse, etc)
671	pos	The weights fit in snug and show no signs of popping loose
671	pos	The bottom "Flap" or whatever you call it, is easy to remove and place back
671	pos	Wire is braided, not the lightest, but still gets the job done well, it is also very long, so you'll have no trouble reaching it to your PC without any restrictions for the most part
671	pos	The software is also very useful and you can reprogram ALL of the buttons to be whatever you want them to be, and the RGB is pretty nice and vivid
671	pos	The sensor is very accurate and well worth the buy
671	pos	Great mouse
672	pos	So far after a month of use, this mouse has been really great
672	pos	Wire isn't as annoying as I thought ir would be (have been using wireless for a decade), and the sensor is the best I've used
672	pos	Logitech software is also easy to use to change the RBG and set profiles for DPI
672	pos	Would highly recommend this mouse
673	pos	this gaming mouse was a good buy for me got it on sale dont really find a problem with the scroll wheel like most people say in the review but i do got to say if you use the  Programmable buttons on the scroll wheel for games its really easy to  Accidentally tap it it gets a little frustrating but once you get the feel for it its nice
673	pos	Had the  Corsair m65 gaming mouse
674	pos	Awesome mouse
674	pos	Everything about it is gets an A+ from my books
674	pos	The only mouse that can probably beat this is a vertical mouse, but there aren't many in the market that can beat this
674	pos	If there is --which I don't know about -- would probably cost extremely expensive, and paying that much for a mouse is kind of ridiculous
675	neg	I had the G302 mouse which lasted 5 years before developing double click issues
675	neg	Huge fan of that mouse
675	neg	This mouse I have for just over a year and it has double clicking, dragging issues
675	neg	If your going to spend $50 on a gaming mouse buy something else unless you want to replace it every year
676	pos	Scroll button loose
676	pos	If playing a game that requires a quick scroll, even if it's adjusted to be click scroll, it's too loose so that it's difficult to switch precisely
676	pos	Maybe with time one could get used to it
676	pos	Not returning as it's a solid mouse, but it's going to the secondary computer
677	pos	Best mouse you will ever buy
677	pos	This is my second one because I wanted one for work as well
677	pos	I have had my older one for over a year and no issues
677	pos	Great feel in your hand, programmable to just plug into any computer and have the programed button keys working as it should
678	neg	It worked great for 1 year
678	neg	Then I started having the clicking issue that multiple other people have mentioned in their reviews
679	neg	All of the dpi buttons for this mouse are in striking range of your left mouse button and mb3
679	neg	So very often you will change your dpi mid game play with a miss click or larger hands
679	neg	Simply resting your hand on your mouse can easily change the dpi of this mouse
679	neg	This is unacceptable and renders the mouse useless especially for any mmo, or fps
680	pos	Initial Review Jan 16, 2021What I like best about this mouse is the main buttons have a nice click, not too loud, not too quiet
680	pos	It is well constructed of good materials
680	pos	The color indicates the mouse speed which is really handy
680	pos	I recommend this mouse for gaming
681	pos	The mouse is great, definitely a huge step up from what I was using before
681	pos	The button that makes the DPI super slow is great for aiming especially in games like Fortnite where I use it the most
681	pos	some of the buttons towards the rear are kind of difficult to reach but I don't use them anyways
681	pos	However, I have had troubles with the software, every time I restart my computer or update it and get on I'll click one of the buttons or move the cursor and realize it's at factory settings
681	pos	So then I go to G hub and It's stuck on a loading screen forever which isn't good when you're in the middle of a match, on top of that it never stops loading so I end up having to delete and reinstall G hub everytime I restart my computer
681	pos	Dont know if It's just my computer or what
681	pos	Overall good mouse, would definetly purchase again
682	neg	In less than a year from purchase my mouse started randomly registering double clicks with the left mouse button
682	neg	After researching the issue it seems this is a known issue with these
682	neg	After contacting Logitech and getting the runaround for over a month they still refuse to replace the mouse under warranty
682	neg	Save yourself the trouble and buy a different brand
683	pos	I've been looking for a mouse that fits my hands "properly" so that my hand doesn't cramp after using it for hours
683	pos	I'm a power user, gamer, programmer, creator and I need something that moves fast, doesn't need to be recharged, is programmable and well pretty colors I can manipulate are also appreciated
683	pos	Seriously though, this mouse glides so nicely, and I absolutely love the scroll lock toggle
684	pos	The options are great - I like being able to customize just about anything on it
684	pos	I frequently hit the button to change the DPI unintentionally, but that is not a big issue as I am not a gamer
684	pos	The overall feel is awesome - just right for my hand, both shape and size
684	pos	Very happy with this mouse
685	pos	Outstanding product
685	pos	I had a free-scrolling mouse for years (also by Logitech), and this is an excellent replacement after going back to a $10 crappy mouse
685	pos	The keys and software are great even for data entry tasks that are repetitive and involve multiple key presses
685	pos	I’ve moved everything to the right hand
686	pos	Only issue I had is I seem to be bumping or somehow changing my dpi accidentally all the time
686	pos	, kind've annoying but you can easily click it back to preferred dpi setting
686	pos	But now I've got DOUBLE CLICKING
686	pos	My left click when you try to click and hold will sometimes double click and not actually hold down
686	pos	Very annoying when bow hunting in this new trendy Valheim game as you waste all your arrows at your feet
686	pos	Currently looking for a better mouse option
687	pos	Love this mouse for gaming
687	pos	I can make several different profiles for different games and change with a click
687	pos	I bind actions to my mouse and these buttons are in a great spot for easy access
687	pos	You can customize it in so many ways
687	pos	This is my second one I got for my other computer since I love my first one so much
688	pos	I have always loved the G series mice, and these are no exception
688	pos	I have one for my work laptop, my home laptop, and my desktop
688	pos	I use them heavily daily and each one has been customized so the extra buttons performs tasks appropriate for the usage I'm going for
688	pos	I like the weight, I like the high DPI, and I love the feel
689	neg	I understand that people will return a mouse if it isn't the right fit for their, however I expect an unused mouse
689	neg	This one seemed like it was used for a month or two due to the wear on the gliders, and fingerprints were all over the extra weights
689	neg	To me, this is unacceptable for something I purchased new
689	neg	Outside of being used, the mouse wheel is the main reason I am returning this
689	neg	The mouse wheel will rattle when the mouse is moved quickly, and is too easy to bump to the right and left, while difficult to press downward
689	neg	The scrolling wasn't smooth either
689	neg	The mouse gliders seem to be a bit thin as well, as it has a bit of a scraping sound on my desk, while my G400s that I've had for a few years is almost silent
689	neg	Not impressed for how expensive the mouse is
690	pos	I've been a long time Logitech fan
690	pos	Keyboards, Mice, Remotes
690	pos	but I've been away from a Logitech mouse for nearly 4 years but I'm back
690	pos	This mouse is just so smooth, glides across my mousepads surface, ample amount of buttons, including the G Suite software
690	pos	It's super easy to program macros of all combinations and map them specifically
690	pos	The RGB logo and the DPI meter are a nice touch to customize
691	neg	Great mouse, has everything I need
691	neg	Unfortunately, the left mouse button began to fail within months of use as if it were a no name piece of junk from Wish
691	neg	Very dissatisfied and I will never buy Logitech again
692	neg	DO NOT BUY
692	neg	Under 2 months of using the mouse everyday, suddenly the G4 button (the "back" button) got SOFTWARE stuck, I took it to a store to fix, they removed the button, removed the board that controls the left side buttons, removed the connection between that board and the main board, and the "back" command was still stuck
692	neg	We tested it using the key S and it never stopped typing it
692	neg	Not when assembled or disassembled
692	neg	Only when we disabled the button function through the HUB it stopped giving the command of typing the letter S
692	neg	Bummer
693	pos	Excelente mouse, ideal para juegos, la sensación mejora considerablemente al deslizar el mouse comparado con otros, solo tuve un detalle, juego Halo y no pude configurar los botones laterales de la rueda del mouse pero esto no es un defecto del mouse, es de configuración de software
693	pos	Lo recomiendo 100 %
694	neg	After about 6mo of mostly desktop use (office, email, text editing) and a few dozen hours of gaming, the left mouse button's switch is broken
694	neg	It registers clicks, but if you try to click and hold it acts like you're clicking like mad instead--some sort of electrical connectivity problem
694	neg	Logitech pushed a firmware update to "update click debouncing algorithm" (technical term for this sort of issue) last month, and it helped--for all of two weeks
694	neg	Now it's worse than before
694	neg	Searching around online reveals this is apparently a widespread issue with Logitech gaming mice
694	neg	Wish I'd known that before I bought
694	neg	Decades of <$20 crap mice and this is the first time I've seen this problem--apparently Logitech is not the brand it once was
694	neg	They've lost me as a customer
695	pos	really good fit for my hands, plenty of buttons and dpi up/down switch
695	pos	Seems super responsive and versatile
695	pos	On board profile switching and automatic game profiles too
695	pos	Has weights you can add/take out to finetune your feel
695	pos	You can get like up to 12 keys if you really mess around with the shortcuts
696	neg	This mouse for gaming isnt really good its only good if u are playing mmo games but still its not the best for the price
696	neg	For shooters its just too heavy and it doesnt feel good at all for flicking and tracking or doing anything for gaming
696	neg	The mouse also feel extremely cheap
697	neg	So I've had this mouse for a couple months
697	neg	I use it most days
697	neg	Shortly after the warrenty period ended the mouse would start disconnecting from G Hub which would cause it to loose all of it's settings until I unplugged it and plugged it back in
697	neg	Then the sensor started doing strange stuff
697	neg	I thought maybe it was dust on the sensor so I cleaned the area and as time has gone on it's only gotten worse
697	neg	Last night I had to unplug it and plug it back in a dozen times or so just to get it to start tracking properly again
697	neg	I've owned Logitech mice before such as the G700s which lasted me literally 6 years (and is about to go back into service)
697	neg	I don't know if I just got a defective product or if Logitech quality has gone down hill in the last several years but at this time I can't recommend this mouse
697	neg	Fun fact, I've had to unplug the mouse about a half dozen times just writing this review
698	neg	In terms of use and ease of programming, I would give this mouse 5 stars
698	neg	The problem is that it only worked well for maybe 6 months
698	neg	It has still not completely failed, but the left mouse button tends to flicker, sometimes making drag moves very difficult (the continual clicking/unclicking drops whatever I am trying to drag)
698	neg	I don't know if this is by design to make people buy new mice regularly, poor manufacturing, or if I am just unlucky
699	neg	The mouse was great until the double click issue happened
699	neg	Now this mouse is trash
699	neg	I had it for 15 months and now it has to get thrown out
699	neg	I would look for something else before buying this one or any other Logitech mouse
700	pos	This is a nice mouse
700	pos	It feels responsive
700	pos	I like the tactile mouse wheel
700	pos	However, this mouse is narrower than logitech's other offerings
700	pos	It causes pain when using and the DPI shift buttons and back/forward buttons are constantly being accidentally triggered during gameplay
700	pos	If you have smaller hands, this may be a good mouse
700	pos	Coming from a G400, this is much smaller than I can tolerate, and I don't have exceptionally large hands
701	pos	Mouse is wonderful responsive and works great
701	pos	However it is easy to press a button accidentally that lowers the dps setting so be on the lookout for that
701	pos	Using software that helps out with that works like a charm
702	neg	Mouse could have been great, but the software is awful
702	neg	Ghub will not recognize my mouse without having to constantly reinstall the program
702	neg	This isn't like once a week or anything, no it's if I turn my computer off I have to reinstall GHUB
702	neg	It's a waste of time
703	neg	I tried to like this mouse, but in the end, I really HATE it
703	neg	For some reason they put the "increase resolution" right next to left-click (no space at all between them)
703	neg	So, I've had to disable the adjustable resolution entirely, just to make the mouse usable
704	pos	Great quality, good app, and great lighting
704	pos	Overall this has become the main mouse for my setup
704	pos	Nothing to really complain about, it's a pretty good product, and its unlikely that something will beat it at its price range
705	pos	Step down from the old G500, less ergo, position and feel of buttons compromised to make it look racy
705	pos	Has pretty LED colors instead of the quality feel of the older models
705	pos	And it uses G-HUB software that pretty much won't work with your older Logitech stuff
706	pos	I love this mouse
706	pos	As for the price, it is outstanding in my opinion
706	pos	The wheel is metal and just feels so great plus the two different modes for the wheel are awesome
706	pos	It has great accuracy and the clicks feel great
706	pos	It is adjustable as far as weight goes
706	pos	I purchased this wired mouse because it fits my situation
706	pos	I am setting up with a couchmaster in a recliner so the wired mouse is no issue
706	pos	The wire will just be internal so it works for me
706	pos	I would definitely buy this again
707	pos	The mouse functions well
707	pos	However, the buttons are loose and feel cheap
707	pos	The software programming is unnecessarily complicated and should work more like the Options utility for the non-gaming mice
707	pos	Also, the settings are unreliable and the device & software combo doesn’t save programming across devices or platforms
707	pos	Lastly the device is NOT Apple Macintosh mobile compatible as the mouse is missing a USB-C adapter
708	neg	The problem I have with this mouse was when I received it the paint on the right clicker had a bubble that peeled off within the 2nd day
708	neg	I wanted to really like this mouse because of all the numerous enchancements but
708	neg	The size of it was really what killed it for me unfortunately and I don't really have that big of a hand
708	neg	I'd say medium to large
709	neg	DPI button stopped working not even 10 hours into use
709	neg	The only good thing about this mouse is the wheel on it
709	neg	The rest of it is trash
709	neg	Save yourself the money and get on of the pictek mouses
710	pos	This mouse has proven it's self time and time again, I recommend it to everyone I know
710	pos	I game a lot, and have had mine for almost 5 years now and it's still kicking  (G502 Proteus Spectrum model, but same base model)
711	pos	This mouse is heavy
711	pos	I regularly play fps games so a light mouse is ideal but I went with it because I watched a lot of reviews and heard a lot of great things about it
711	pos	I have used it for about three months now and I have had no issues with it
711	pos	I plan on lightening this mouse some way in the near future but until then I do fine with it
711	pos	It did take some time to adjust considering I came from a mouse that was about 20g lighter
711	pos	I do recommend buying a bungee for your mouse
711	pos	For this mouse I bought a razor bungee because it has a braided cable and it works perfectly with it
711	pos	In terms of size I have hands larger than most people so I find having a claw grip works best for me and this mouse is fine for that
711	pos	It forms to the hand well and feels great, if you have never tried a g502 before I recommend trying it
711	pos	Also to note I took off the bottom of the mouse where you are suppose to put the weights that come with it and it lightened it a bit and have had no problems playing with it off
712	pos	I love this mouse so much I own 3 of em
712	pos	one for each PC I own
712	pos	The mouse click in it can get messed up after prolonged use, but it doesnt happen in every mouse, and is an easy fix after watching a few youtube videos
712	pos	The weight of the mouse is perfect, the buttons are in the perfect places, and it just feels good in your hand
712	pos	Very high dpi and accuracy of movement making it perfect for pro gamers as well
712	pos	Highly recommend this mouse
713	pos	I like the logtech mice
713	pos	This one has just enough buttons, although we all could probably design our own a tad bit different
713	pos	This works really well in Ghub sub software, make sure to install that to run this mouse to full potential
714	neg	There is a known problem with the LMB (left mouse button) for several users (check google)
714	neg	If you hold it down the LMB  registers as if you are tapping it rapidly
714	neg	This is extremely frustrating when you are dragging and dropping as it registers the LMB down up down up down up etc
714	neg	I emailed customer service with a detailed email
714	neg	After several emails (over the course of a month) they proceeded to tell me to go to a different site to test my mouse, make a video with my phone with the mouse and screen in the picture (really
714	neg	), upload it to youtube and then send them a link
714	neg	ARE YOU KIDDING ME
714	neg	If that's the end result then why did you waste a month of back and forth emails, Logitech
714	neg	I should have stuck with Roccat
715	pos	This mouse has great quality material and works amazing
715	pos	Even the small weights that you can add at the bottom are amazing
715	pos	I’ve used this mouse for both mmo gaming and first person shooter gaming and highly recommend for anyone looking for a not super expensive, super high quality gaming mouse
716	pos	I'm quite happy with this mouse for use in gaming and with my work
716	pos	The options available to customize it for individual needs are very helpful
716	pos	From adjusting the weight to configuring the functionality of each button to the dpi options
716	pos	it's all good in my book
717	pos	I never stop to appreciate the quality of packaging
717	pos	This time, I did
717	pos	It's very nicely packaged
717	pos	I love the little weights you can add to the mouse, and the scroll wheel has two modes, a fast, smooth one and a slower, more precise one where you get some haptic feedback with each scroll, very useful for gaming
717	pos	The accent lights are changeable, very nice feel overall
718	neg	TL;DR: Mouse breaks quickly
718	neg	I'm a casual gamer, but I use my mouse pretty frequently
718	neg	The button locations and customizability were nice
718	neg	I bought mine about 9 months ago
718	neg	It worked great for the first ~5 months
718	neg	Then the left mouse button (LMB) started double-clicking when I single clicked
718	neg	This made it frustrating, but almost usable
718	neg	After a month, this went away for a couple weeks before it came back worse
718	neg	It's now unusuable because I cannot click-drag or single click reliably
718	neg	I tried contacting Logitech, and they sent back a long email of many steps to try to fix the problem
718	neg	None of those steps resolved the issue
719	pos	Well, it fits good, but not as good as my 505s which they don't make anymore
719	pos	L/R buttons are too soft, too easy to right click by mistake
719	pos	Wheel is not as grippy as it should be
719	pos	Also, when you move the scroll wheel, the detents are too aggressive and you "miss" as in your finger slips off
719	pos	Has to be a way to lessen the stiffness of the scroll wheel
719	pos	We'll see as time goes on
719	pos	Won't buy it again tho nor will I recommend it
720	neg	I had high hopes for this mouse
720	neg	I like the fact that it was corded, as my cordless (Logitech) mouse was not responding anymore
720	neg	From the moment I got it, the software setup was ridiculous
720	neg	A big black square that you have to close of just to even get a hint at the menu, which has settings selection minimized
720	neg	All I wanted to do was to get the lighted logo on the mouse to stop breathing and changing color
720	neg	I would have preferred it not to even be present
720	neg	You can set this, but it's bindings break while you use the mouse and cause your gameplay to be very unstable and sometimes it will force a complete pc restart
720	neg	AVOID this gimmick
720	neg	It would be a FINE mouse if Logitech didn't farm the software portion out to be developed by kids in a sweatshop
720	neg	I loved Logitech, but this will be the LAST product I buy from them
721	neg	When the mouse works, I like the mouse
721	neg	Plenty of buttons to operator and responsive enough for me and feels pretty nice
721	neg	However, my mouse started having the double click issue which is issue that caused me to swap from Razer to Logitech
721	neg	I was able to get a replacement from Logitech at a reasonable time, I know they are busy in these times, but when it arrived the G8 key (default DPI Shift Up) was loose and slightly out of position, I have to shift the button around and press extremely hard to get it to work, not reasonable for in the middle of a game (I tend to map certain inputs to that button)
721	neg	I have yet to see if I can fix it myself, but both mice having a hardware issue is rather disappointing
721	neg	Would not recommend at this time myself
722	neg	I had all sorts of issues with this right out of the box
722	neg	Simple actions like left and right clicking wouldn't work on other windows unless you clicked a "profile change" or "g-shift" button
722	neg	None of Logitech's software was helpful either
722	neg	Complete waste of a mouse and waste of my time
723	pos	4 out of 5 for one reason: though this mouse is big, bug hands like mine are not its target audience, and I hate so much that its not the most comfortable mouse for me because I love every single other thing about this mouse
723	pos	The back of it drops off too fast, and its too shallow for large hands (8 inches from the base to the tip of the middle finger)
723	pos	So typically it becomes a bit of a struggle to get it in a good position, but thankfully it is still good for a palm grip because its very long, youll just be dragging your palm on the mousepad a lot and your pinky and ring fingers will have a hard time figuring out where to go
723	pos	Otherwise, everything else about this mouse is perfect and definitely lives up to the marketing material
724	pos	At the time of writing this review, I've destroyed this mouse through fault of my own
724	pos	Liked it so much I bought a second one (the wireless version of the same model
724	pos	)It doesn't make you a God of aim, but you sure as hell feel like one, and it absolutely makes you capable
724	pos	Good work Logitech, you've made the best gaming mouse ever
725	pos	Unbeatable value at $34
725	pos	95
725	pos	Full of features and great build quality
725	pos	Excellent for everyday use and does well for gaming
725	pos	Fair usability as a large hand fingertip gripper, better with claw, ideal with medium hand palm
726	pos	I got this product when it was on sale for 35 bucks and it's original price is 90$ or more so it was a good deal and honestly love how all the side buttons and middle wheel buttons are programmable for every game so saves a lot of button pressing on keyboard
726	pos	Perfect for fortnite users who need to build fast
727	pos	Out of the dozens of mice I have owned this is by far my favorite
727	pos	The dimensions make this mouse great for large and wide hands, while still being dynamic enough to comfortably detach from the palm for finer movements
727	pos	The thumb shield on the side is generous, and seems like it can support even the largest of thumbs
727	pos	The unlockable scroll wheel is super fun
727	pos	The buttons all have a decent amount of resistance to them and are well positioned to avoid accidental clicks
727	pos	Overall this mouse offers a lot through a good balance of fun and functionality
728	neg	I have a G700S best mouse i have ever owned, getting old, so i looked for a new mouse, i decided on the G502 hero
728	neg	didnt use it for a long time so when my G700 finally got to the point of not working i used the 502 man what a mistake, when you go to shoot nothing happens you have to keep clicking the firte button to get it to work, biggest mistake i ever made, after hours upon hours of trying to find some reason behind it i finally gave up, i broke out the G700 and patched it the best i can dont know what to do now i have a paper weight 502 that is useless to me and since i dint use it right away and waited so long to use it i cant return it
728	neg	sucks
729	pos	This is probably one of the best mice I have ever owned
729	pos	It's got a fair amount of buttons, feels great in the hand and sails smoothly over the mousepad
729	pos	It's seriously great
729	pos	It's also nice that it comes with adjustable weights and rgb and all that
730	pos	I have owned all of the version of the g502, it by far is the best mouse you can buy
730	pos	The level of customization is just endless
730	pos	The Hero is definitely an upgrade from the previous one
730	pos	The buttons feels so much better, much more clicky, and the finish of the mouse feels a lot better too, I can get a much better grip of it than I could with the Proteus Spectrum
730	pos	Even the scroll wheel feel better
730	pos	This mouse gives the most bang for your bucks
730	pos	Trust me, you won't regret buying it
731	pos	Great mouse, i love the fluid controls and how everything is right where i need it
731	pos	i game on a laptop, and between this mouse and my gameing pad, I dont even need a full keyboard
731	pos	The software provides excellent customization capabilities
731	pos	I really like that i can customize all led zones
731	pos	the one negative, FOR ME, is it's kinda small
731	pos	i have a pretty large hand so something a little wider would probably suit my dexterity purposes better
731	pos	that being said, being able to add weight makes it a little easier to control
731	pos	over all a great product that truly performs
731	pos	the DPI shift button is an amazing feature
731	pos	snappy head shots are almost a given at ANY time haha
731	pos	great product
732	pos	honestly the best mouse i've ever owned
732	pos	because i game so much i usually go through Mice pretty hard
732	pos	this one has stood up to my constant use, and pretty much laughs at me every time
732	pos	the weights are nice to have, and the software was really easy to install and get set up for the color changing
732	pos	goes amazingly well with alienware :D
733	pos	I use this mouse for mainly for gaming, but this mouse is perfect for everyday use, I love this mouse cause of how versatile it is
733	pos	I love playing with snipers with this mouse becuase fo the ease of shifting dpi so quickly, This mouse is SOOOO accurate, turn the games mouse sensivity WAY DOWN and turn your mouse sensitivity ALLL THE WAY UP to 25,600 dots per inch YOU WILL LOVE IT, you can assign each button to suit your play style, you can have saved setups for different game which is AWESOME to me, I would fully recomend this mouse to anyone
734	pos	My arms are like coiled steel
734	pos	Lifting this mouse every day to game is like a full body workout
734	pos	Mortals will weep at how dexterous and strong your arms are
735	neg	Avoid
735	neg	Junk
735	neg	Bad part quality
735	neg	Microswitches are garbage
735	neg	No clicks, double clicks
735	neg	Cannot drag anything
735	neg	Waste of money
735	neg	Logitech used to have a great reputation for quality
735	neg	They ruined it with their cheap part selection
736	pos	Amazing mouse
736	pos	Not sponsored BTW
736	pos	This mouse feels decent in your hand
736	pos	There are nicely placed side buttons
736	pos	You can toggle the scroll wheel to spin freely with the use of a toggleable button
736	pos	My complaint is that it doesn't have much rgb lights which my other mouse had before I broke it
736	pos	Kinda wish the mouse was more bright and colorful than it is
736	pos	Maybe a nice rgh light strip on the base outline of the mouse that you can customize with an app would be nice
736	pos	I would pay like at least 10 more dollars for that
736	pos	Take notes Logitech
737	pos	I have used the mouse over 2 years
737	pos	With a large, Alpha-male's hand, I dislike the thin layout
737	pos	My hand cramps trying to hold it for long periods-of-time
737	pos	Most recently, the right click has began to fail
737	pos	While holding it down, the right-click will stop functioning and I have to release and right-click again to initiate it
738	neg	I have finally had it with Logitech's quality issues
738	neg	I have forgiven for past finish issues but now my only 9 month old mouse with light to moderate gaming is double clicking or getting stuck sporadically
738	neg	I have finally tired of their quality control issues, this is my last Logitech product
739	pos	This is an updated version of a very popular mouse
739	pos	Excellent feel in my hand
739	pos	Buttons are responsive and have a quiet but audible click
739	pos	The whole mouse feels well built and the cable is flexible and durable
739	pos	The associated Logitech program is very useful with automatic profiles although I prefer to program the onboard mouse settings and set up keybinds in game
740	pos	Very ergonomic
740	pos	I am a stroke survivor, and have limited use of my right hand
740	pos	This mouse's DPI levels easily make it a breeze to use, and it fits so well in my hand
740	pos	Buttons are easy to reach, but far enough apart that you don't accidentally misclick something
740	pos	Download the Logitech software to easily assign whatever you want to the buttons
741	pos	The mouse works well
741	pos	It is comfortable, adjustable, has weights to make it easier to use
741	pos	The only thing I hate is that the GHUB software is very confusing
741	pos	It still doesn't seem to have all the functionality of the old software
741	pos	Eventually I got it to do what I needed, to save profiles on the mouse itself
741	pos	I am using it with a USB switch to control multiple computers
741	pos	This also allows me to use on Linux computers
742	neg	I ordered this new g502 hero since I used the proteus spectrum and I decided to upgrade
742	neg	When I received it I noticed it was not flat and there was a glider that was stacked making it uneven
742	neg	So I got a replacement and this one one of the gliders was not even attachedluckily it wasn't stuck on yet so I was able to place it where it was supposed to be
743	pos	Honestly, this is a great mouse
743	pos	I love the fact you can on the fly adjust your scrolling speed with a press of a button and let that middle wheel fly
743	pos	The only thing that's pointless is the front of the mouse , you can't see it ever, so don't let that weird spiky front scare you away its all good, buy this now
743	pos	FYI I can from a G9 laser mouse that I owned for almost 10 years, this feels just right
744	neg	The default DPI buttons are positioned so closely to the left mouse button that the only real option for them is to disable the buttons completely
744	neg	This mouse is not suitable for any serious gamer
744	neg	On the plus side, it is a well built unit and perfectly suitable for everyday use
745	neg	Since around 4 months after I got the mouse left button stop working proper in game and out
745	neg	It can't even move windows without having issues
745	neg	In game to shot I had to remap, it was just horrible
745	neg	Bought in august of 19 and now its its March of 2021, I think it only worked properly the first month to four before going to crap
746	pos	So to start off I bought this mouse because it’s the mouse everyone talks about when it comes to gaming
746	pos	While I like this mouse I think the the Corsair m65 is a far more comfortable and efficient gaming mouse
746	pos	The DPI selection buttons On the G502 are in an awkward and easily mistaken press able location which effects gameplay
746	pos	So in my opinion while this is a good mouse for the same price I would buy the Corsair m65
747	pos	Honestly the biggest upgrade is not having to use razers software, its garbage
747	pos	logitech's software isn't the best, but way better than Razers
747	pos	Weight wise i didnt feel much of a difference and the amount of buttons is very nice
747	pos	I also use the free scroll wheel pretty often when browsing the web
748	neg	I got this mouse roughly 9 months ago
748	neg	The shape of the mouse is good, the braded cable is very nice and the weight system is very good
748	neg	However the switches in this mouse are abysmal, after just 9 months they have started to die, I get constant double clicks and the mouse frequently stops holding down clicks, making the mouse practically unusable as dragging windows, highlighting text, and playing games where you have to hold buttons a massive pain or completely impractical
748	neg	If these are the standards Logitech holds their products to I would avoid this mouse at all costs as you can likely get something much more reliable for this price
749	neg	I'm on my 3rd one in 2 years
749	neg	The left mouse button keeps messing up
749	neg	It either won't register a click, clicks twice, or releases when you're still holding down on the button
749	neg	Feels great in the hand, but that left mouse button is just reliably unreliable on all 3 of the ones I've had now
749	neg	Avoid
750	pos	This mouse has the index finger buttons I was looking for, has a good material feel, and on-the-fly DPI switching
750	pos	So far it's working flawlessly, and I'm liking it as a replacement for my Corsair Saber
751	neg	Same issue that a lot of other people are having
751	neg	Right at 6 months; I have double clicking issues that are getting worse every day (impossible to use)
751	neg	Been buying this brand my whole life
751	neg	Not going to anymore
751	neg	So many people having the same issues and almost all of us at around the same time frame
751	neg	This isn't right
752	pos	Not only does it keep the same overall design from the G402 which is the perfect size and shape for my larger hands
752	pos	It even improves on it, better gripping textures and free-scrolling mouse wheel make this a perfect fit for me
752	pos	Great build quality and a nice weight to it
753	pos	Well this will be short
753	pos	The only downside of this mouse is the broken scroll wheel
753	pos	Once you wear it out, it will break loose and will not function correctly
753	pos	Other than that, I’ve been killing it on valorant
753	pos	The sensor is amazing
753	pos	Just wish the material was more durable and higher quality
753	pos	The sensor doesn’t deserve such low quality plastic
753	pos	**UPDATE**I’m so stupid
753	pos	There’s a button that is solely for making the scroll wheel a free loose wheel
753	pos	Pressing it again will go back to its tactile normal scroll wheel
753	pos	I’m sorry
753	pos	This mouse is the best
754	neg	On new Macs this will be identified as a keyboard and won't work
754	neg	It will literally work as a mouse but that's it; software can't bind keys
754	neg	I spent a LONG time with Logitech confirming this
754	neg	Don't buy
755	neg	This mouse has been great no real issues till now, now i get double click
755	neg	March 30 2019 is when I bought this mouse that is just over a year
755	neg	I used to love Logitech but its like I'm chasing an old dream that is never as good as I once thought
755	neg	I started out with the Logitech G9x and built around Logitech for years
755	neg	I even bought into the headset (G430) and keyboard(G910)
755	neg	However now that's done, this is the second time replacing the G502 mouse for the same issue right about the same length of time
755	neg	I think what I will miss most is infinty scroll that was so nice
756	pos	Bought one because my wife/friends/entire internet seem to like the mouse, but it doesn't suit my grip
756	pos	I'm constantly accidentally clicking just by resting my fingers down because the actuation force is so low
756	pos	If I reposition to avoid that, I can't click the middle mouse button easily
757	pos	Havent bought a mouse in 6 years and thought of stickin with this family of mice
757	pos	I had the old g5 and it as weighted well, with supplied weights
757	pos	The new g5 is a bit less substantial but it makes up for that with a better hand design and many more buttons
757	pos	And an optional break on the wheel is cool
757	pos	Release the break and that wheel is well balanced and great for scrolling
757	pos	Great product
758	pos	Logitech nailing it again with button placement on this one
758	pos	Very responsive mouse with nice grip
758	pos	The extra buttons on the left click have become a necessity for me
758	pos	My only complaint is the "edgy gamer" design
758	pos	I'd prefer something a little more subtle and not as flashy
759	neg	The mouse has started double clicking when I click once
759	neg	This is a big issue when I try to highlight things or play any of my games
759	neg	I loved it when it was working but for how much I paid and how quickly it begun to stop working, just poor build quality
760	neg	So it's a really good mouse but, unfortunately, the insides are made of cheap material
760	neg	Notably, the mouse contacts/switches are really bad
760	neg	I had the mouse for barely a year and there was already double-clicking and rapid clicking (can't hold a mouse button down
760	neg	) I bought another one cause it was on sale and I honestly like this mouse, but I can't in good conscience recommend it for anyone else
760	neg	As soon as this new one wears out I'm switching brands
761	pos	I purchased this one to replace my old gaming mouse (same model) that lasted a full 6 years of heavy gaming
761	pos	My old mouse started having an issue with the middle mouse wheel button not working anymore when pressed
761	pos	At any rate, 6 years of hard core gaming I'm happy that my old mouse lasted that long
762	pos	The mouse works very well
762	pos	I really enjoy the added weights to the back of the mouse
762	pos	I only wish there was a way to lock the flap in place where the weights fit into the mouse but that's a fairly minor problem that only becomes annoying if the mouse falls onto the ground
762	pos	App works, buttons work, good feel
763	neg	I was really liking this mouse until the left mouse button starting acting up
763	neg	I loved the ability to lock the scroll wheel (or let it spin freely)
763	neg	After using it for about 8 months the left click started to release before I released the button and then it got worse and almost every click became double clicks making it pretty much useless
763	neg	I thought Logitech was better quality than this I'm still using my G-15 keyboard (12+ years later) but I guess I will have to look elsewhere for mice
764	neg	I bought this because I had purchased a gaming mouse a few years before and enjoyed it albeit it wasn't a well known company so when I did run into issues it was annoying
764	neg	I thought I was safe buying a logitech brand mouse
764	neg	apparently not, because within a few month the LMB single click became a double click 1/4th of the time which can cause havok when attempting even the simplest of Drag-and-drop tasks
764	neg	Do yourself a favor and do not buy Logitech products
765	neg	Left click fails to drag randomly
765	neg	Left click double clicks with a left click and hold
765	neg	Left click fail to even registar randomly
765	neg	Left click double click with a single click
765	neg	Logitech support is like a black hole
765	neg	Update
765	neg	The black hole finely sent me a replacementReplacement mouse fails the same way in less than 8 months
766	pos	Able to adjust the weight, just like the original one
766	pos	Great lightingGreat designFeels smooth and the buttons allow for quick change to settings
766	pos	You can also customize the button functions
766	pos	I’ve been using the G502 model for 3 - 4 years now
766	pos	Ever since I got this I fell in love with the fact that you can adjust the weight
766	pos	Although at first it was confusing to use with all the buttons
767	pos	So far, I like every feature of this mouse with no complaints
767	pos	I'll update this review if anything changes, but so far, a very solid purchase
767	pos	The app could be a little more user-friendly, but it's pretty easy to figure out after you wipe over your old profile a couple of times
767	pos	I haven't tried all of the features, and I do wish the RBG light display were more visible during use since your hand covers it up, but not really sure how you'd design around that either
768	pos	So i've been using this mouse since october of 2019 and let me say this is one of if not my favorite mouse that i've ever used
768	pos	That being said though, i am running into the right click double click issue as well as my left click not registering all the time
768	pos	For example, i usually play fps games (mainly escape from tarkov) and when i left click to shoot fully automatic, the gun sprays on an off
768	pos	Not sure if there's a fix for this
768	pos	I will try fixing on my own but if not then i'll be buying the same exact mouse again
768	pos	If it wasnt for the left and right click issue i would have gave this 5/5 stars
769	neg	In order to have your thumb half on on one of the side buttons and half on the other it must be held by your fingertips
769	neg	In that position you can't reach the DPI buttons or the lower side button without reaching out with your index finger or thumb
769	neg	The mouse I got also started to left double-click all by itself when you wanted to single-click after 7-8 weeks
769	neg	Too late  (past 30 days ) to send it back
769	neg	Now I have to try and deal with Logitech about Warranty
769	neg	Great
770	neg	Item stopped working literally within the first hour of being plugged in
770	neg	Light went out and mouse became unresponsive
770	neg	Plugged into another computer and same result
770	neg	Plugged my other G502 into the computer and it works perfectly so problem is definitely with the brand new mouse
770	neg	Disappointed because got it on sale and now can't get a proper replacement without paying extra
771	pos	A precise mouse with great buttons and tracking
771	pos	The mouse wheel can be used as a 3 way button, down, left and right
771	pos	While down is good, left and right are a bit wobbly as the wheel is not very secure side to side
771	pos	The slight bit of sloppy wobble makes using the left and right buttons of the wheel clunky and not a fine control movement
771	pos	Other than the left and right wheel functions the mouse is a solid performer
772	neg	For gaming, the mouse handed well
772	neg	And was easy to program
772	neg	Ergonomic, I have a average sized hand
772	neg	I found my ring finger sits almost directly on top of my pinky
772	neg	Which was uncomfortable
772	neg	Material quality, seems to have an average soft black plastic outside
772	neg	But the M2 button would occasionally become unresponsive to clicks
772	neg	Over all I found this to be an attractive gaming mouse
772	neg	It died too soon
773	pos	Sooo many buttons
773	pos	nice
773	pos	The weights you can add in don't make much difference to me, but I bet some people will like that feature
773	pos	I like especially that you can make the scroll-wheel smooth or clicky with just a button press
773	pos	Awesome
774	neg	Mouse is fine (so far) My complaint is mainly Logitech software forcing you to enroll in either full time spying or part time spying if you want to customize the DPI
774	neg	Why is the fact that I payed for the product NEVER enough for these companies
774	neg	If Corsair mice didn't have left click hardware failures, and Razor didn't have viruses built in to the driver install (Hello 2005 Sony rootkit fiasco) I'd have gone with them
774	neg	Can I justr get a ball mouse with a PS2 connector at this point
775	pos	the mouse itself is a good mouse
775	pos	fits perfectly in my hand
775	pos	i should of read the reviews before i purchase it though, i would of not bought it if i did
775	pos	the double clicking is annoying and very bad while trying to game or design; basically bad overall
775	pos	straight out of the box my middle mouse button does not work
775	pos	(like opening/closing a tab) i have installed the G HUB and update the drivers and it did not help
775	pos	i been using Logitech my whole life and i never had any problems with them before until this mouse
776	pos	Yes, this mouse is a bit on the heavier side but it is not a con for me
776	pos	The grips, buttons, and ergonomics of this mouse is of the best compared to other gaming mice
776	pos	I replaced my original G502 Proteus Spectrum with other gaming mice and I am glad to say that I am back with Logitech
776	pos	After trying out different gaming mice i have finally realized that no mouse could possibly be as good the the G502 mouse
776	pos	This product is really worth it and you will not be disappointing with your purchase
777	neg	If you have small hands it will work just fine but don’t buy this for gaming hoping you can remap the buttons don’t because you can’t only 2 side buttons and the main buttons are usable others only do computer functions and remapping there not game functions
778	pos	This gaming mouse has pretty much everything you would need from a gaming mouse
778	pos	Extra buttons for marcos, high refresh rate, adjustable weight, and RGB
778	pos	Bought it on sale to replace an older razer mouse and this has been a great mouse so far
779	pos	Been using it heavily now for the past several months and am very happy with it, both for gaming and for everyday tasks (YouTube, Reddit, email, etc
779	pos	) Look I figure if you're reading reviews for mice like this then you've done what I did, in watching review videos and 9+ tabs open with different options, so you already know what it's all about
779	pos	It felt good in my hand (claw but with more palm
779	pos	) and dialing in the weight made it feel better
779	pos	I play 400dpi so re-placing the mouse happens a lot, it feels solid when I do it
779	pos	Slight reverb in the wheel, but nothing I wouldn't expect
779	pos	Also, the free scrolling wheel is hilariously fun
779	pos	Only gripes I have so far is wanting more rgb and *seriously* that the dpi up button feels so on top of mouse1 that I found myself switching sens in the middle of a fight
779	pos	It became much less of a problem after two weeks or so of use, but I definitely still tell my teammates that's why I lost the fight
779	pos	I'm still happy with grabbing this, would recommend
780	neg	Compre el mouse hace un tiempo y lo uso solo jugar ocasionalmente, ayer note que no podia apuntar bien en shooter y me di cuenta del error de click izquierdo y entre a buscar informacion al respecto, me encontre con que muchas personas reportaban este error, una completa decepcion
781	pos	I don't game much, but this mouse has been great for productivity and video editing
781	pos	The software makes it super easy to customize and save a profile, and the RGB lighting is a bonus in the dark
781	pos	I don't mind the gamer-y aesthetic, but it'd be nice to have a matte option instead of the glossy plastic on some parts
782	pos	This is easily the best mouse out there for what it does
782	pos	There are enough extra buttons that they are useful without compromising the way you hold the mouse
782	pos	The weight is perfect and adjustable for those that like light or extremely heavy mice
782	pos	The previous version lasted me for almost 6 years, and even then the only issue was that the adhesive on the bottom mouse pads (helps the mouse glide smoothly) was wearing out
782	pos	I likely could have kept using it for a while but opted to support Logitech's commitment to durability and performance with purchasing a new one
782	pos	I recommend this mouse for essentially any use case
783	pos	Sure, it gets the job done, but it's no G700S, which is what I replaced with this
783	pos	Something about the angle on this one causes my computer to think that clicks are drags, also, so I often have to click something several times before it registers a click
784	neg	I purchased this because I needed a replacement for my older Logitech mouse
784	neg	However this one had some issues "clicking" on items and resolution wasn't very good
784	neg	I don't recommend
784	neg	Logitech needs to get back to the old "standard" of quality product
785	pos	You're probably scrolling through metric tons of reviews to see if they're legit
785	pos	I went 6 years on with a Logitech G700 Wired and that mouse had lasted me almost 7 years up; until now I've been through all kinds of mice and this one has seemed to outlast the others so far
785	pos	The weights that come with the mouse were kinda weird tbh
785	pos	At first glance it seemed to help in certain situations with mouse movement, but it wasn't so much different at all
785	pos	What I like about this mouse is the speed you can set your pointer at
785	pos	There are also some other nik-nacks I like about this mouse that I don't want to go forever on about
785	pos	I got this for about 55 dollars and I had a gift card with the purchase
785	pos	Overall this mouse so far it's great
785	pos	For more info, I've had this mouse since mid June of 2019
786	pos	I really liked the additional weights included
786	pos	The mouse itself feels great in the hand, and is a breeze to use gaming
786	pos	The only downside is that there isn't an up and down DPI button, just one that only goes up until it resets at the bottom of the dpi list
786	pos	Make sure to download Logitech G Hub to customize dpi settings, and other cool little additions, like light settings
787	pos	Enough buttons for a fps games
787	pos	Custom weights are great, which is why I keep coming back to this mouse
787	pos	Sole issue, back pads let go on the sharp edge
787	pos	Hopefully third ones a charm
788	pos	Feels great, works amazing, the DPI +/- buttons are not remapable, they can be turned off or assigned to a key press
788	pos	I didn't like the scroll wheel
788	pos	It's tactile turn just wasn't good feeling
788	pos	Hard to explain, but overall a good mouse
788	pos	I just prefer my M65
789	neg	It's unbelievable how terrible the logitech software is
789	neg	Every day I encounter the issue where the additional buttons don't work
789	neg	Only after restarting G-Hub (every day) I can get the functionality back
789	neg	Not to mention, the logitech software tools are fragmented and they seem to have an app per product
789	neg	:/
790	neg	Had this mouse for a few months before the left mouse button started acting extremely touchy
790	neg	This wasn't much of an issue as I could just change how I held the mouse to avoid accidental button inputs
790	neg	Now, just over a year after getting this mouse, I've been experiencing 'spinouts' on a somewhat frequent basis
790	neg	This mouse worked great for me besides these two flaws
790	neg	The touchy LMB has made playing some fps's very challenging, but was mainly just irritating
790	neg	This new spinout issue, however, is unacceptable for a mouse that's been used for just over one year when I've had cheaper mice last 3-4 years
790	neg	If you're willing to replace a product year after year, this IS a 4-5 star product
790	neg	But for me, at this pricepoint, I can't give more than 2 stars
791	pos	What a great mouse for the price
791	pos	Excellent weight with the adjustables
791	pos	Quality feels extremely premium pairs extremely nicely with my Logitech g 802 keyboard
792	pos	Update #2: Within a week, Logitech had a replacement at my door
792	pos	back up to 4 stars, will return if the new one starts to malfunction in an unreasonable amount of time
792	pos	Update: Hasn't been 2 months yet and right click is starting to fail
792	pos	Outside of Amazon return window, currently have warranty request pending through Logitech
792	pos	Good mouse, clicks feel good, button variety is great
793	pos	Got this mouse for my rig, which hasn't all arrived yet, so I am using it with my "current" pc
793	pos	Full linux support out of the box
793	pos	It comes baked in with some pretty great settings
793	pos	nice feel, it feels like this mouse is the other half to my hand
793	pos	The cable is nice and flexible
793	pos	The biggest thing I can say is full linux support
793	pos	I run ubuntu mate as my daily driver OS, and this thing is perfect
793	pos	Full RGB control using the openRGB project, and full button mapping support from piper
793	pos	A must have for linux gamers imo, its a good mouse, and looks to be fully supported
794	pos	I had a G502 for five (eight maybe) plus, years
794	pos	I had to replace the plastic pads on the other side a couple times, but it was a champion and didn't exactly fail, but lost the distinct click in the right button
794	pos	This mouse is the much-updated version with control of the lighting effects and higher resolution
794	pos	It feels the same software with the added features
794	pos	It is a great design I'm glad to see Logitech sticking to something that works
795	pos	After using this mouse for a few months, so far so good
795	pos	The mouse has done more than what I can imagine
795	pos	The multiple keys on the mouse has made things very convenient for me and the speed and quality of the mouse is more than expected
795	pos	TBH, I would order another one just for a spare because this mouse has been amazing
795	pos	I am still waiting to see the occurring problems with the mouse wheel from other reviewers
795	pos	It has not happened to me yet, so far so good
796	pos	I've been buying cheaper gaming mice for years, and they always break down fast, and feel cheap
796	pos	This mouse is perfect for me so far, the clicks feel really good, and the low dpi "sniping" button is perfect
796	pos	It also feels great in the hand, the thumb rest is great, and the infinite scroll function has been way more useful then I thought it would
797	pos	Been using the G502 model for years for different uses such as gaming, browsing, and coding
797	pos	It hasn't failed me once in any of those aspects
797	pos	I love the amount of buttons it has, very useful for gaming
797	pos	It always felt great on my hand
797	pos	Highly recommend this mouse
798	pos	I bought this mouse because it was reviewed as fitting larger hands
798	pos	My hands are decently large, with long fingers
798	pos	I can say that I don't ever experience fatigue when using the mouse
798	pos	It's easily customizable and very responsive
798	pos	For the price, I couldn't beat it
799	neg	Overall the mouse functions amazingly, however it suffers from durability issues
799	neg	I've gone through two G502 Hero mice, one I bought here, one I got as a replacement for it from Logitech Support
799	neg	Both mice functioned perfectly the first couple months, but after about 2-3 months of normal use the Right Click button starts becoming unreliable
799	neg	Initially it's very subtle but as time goes on it becomes more and more pronounced
799	neg	Sometimes you get one right click and it works fine, other times you get two or more right clicks with a single press, and sometimes nothing at all
799	neg	Not the end of the world if you're browsing the web but any gaming mechanic that depends on exactly one right click or a right click and hold becomes unpredictable
799	neg	After getting two of the G502 Hero from two different sources (Amazon and Logitech Support) and both showing the same problem in such a short period of time, I absolutely recommend you DO NOT buy this mouse
800	pos	I was skeptical at first because some people seem to have problems with these and a couple of other brands regarding clicking, maybe they play a little too hardcore in FPS games but for everyday use it works perfectly fine for me
800	pos	Still early to tell but lets see where it ends up a couple more months down the line
800	pos	Hoping it lasts me years but who knows
801	neg	The scroll wheel is waayyyy to loose for me
801	neg	I play your typical games fortnite, cod, etc
801	neg	editing is almost impossible cause the wheel spins an extra click
801	neg	Other than that, Great mouse
801	neg	Has weights you can adjust at the bottom
801	neg	The killer is the very loose scroll wheel
802	pos	I always thought mice with a ton of extra buttons were over the top, but I wish I would have purchased this mouse years ago
802	pos	I use it for gaming and work (I’m a software engineer), and it is bar none the best mouse I’ve ever used
802	pos	I love the on-board profiles and how easy it is to switch between them
802	pos	I have large hands, and most mice are too small
802	pos	I usually end up having to roll my pinky under my ring finger, which causes discomfort after prolonged use
802	pos	This mouse fits my hand perfectly, and I feel like I could use it for hours
802	pos	I would buy this mouse again in a heartbeat
803	pos	More mice than I need, I don't do gaming but need a high-resolution mouse
803	pos	Con: the left button sometimes requires multiple actuation to work
803	pos	I guess that has been a problem with this mouse for a long time
804	pos	Husband's only complaint is he can't figure out how to set up the On Board Memory with this mouse
804	pos	He hasn't really looked into and will end up getting his brother to help him set it up but he's over all content with the mouse and use of it :)
805	pos	I’ve been using the G502 for years now, just bought my own for my new setup and it has such a nice feel to it
805	pos	I don’t use all the weights provided so it can feel a little lighter, but the whole idea of being able to adjust the weight is amazing
805	pos	I also like the amount of buttons the mouse has, definitely not too many to confuse me, but just enough for me to bind essential things to the buttons
805	pos	This is an essential gaming mouse, it’s all around balanced and will last you years easily
806	pos	Has cool features, and the hardware feels sturdy
806	pos	The design is awesome and I love the scroll wheel, not sure why people give the wheel hate it feels great
806	pos	Haters gonna hate I guess
806	pos	I wish they made the G502 slightly bigger for people with big hands (I am coming off a Rival 300), but size wise, it is 98% perfect for me
806	pos	I love the weight of this mouse too
806	pos	Was a great buy
807	neg	I honestly feel there should be some call of lawsuit for logitech to fix there products, logitech quality has been going down and what happened to being the world class for mice and keyboards
807	neg	yo logitech you suck fix the mouse issue, im tired of missing my snipes with the right button issue
808	neg	The good:This mouse is everything you could want in a wired mouse
808	neg	Excellent surface tracking, no pointer spazziness, an adjustable weight cartridge, and great button feel
808	neg	The bad:This mouse has a design flaw in the buttons which cause them to sometimes click twice instead of once
808	neg	The latest driver update "debounces" the clicks, reducing the problem, but it still happens sometimes
809	neg	This gaming mouse is absolute garbage, I have had 2 now and BOTH had intermittent left and right mouse buttons making it absolutely worthless for gaming and pretty terrible for anything else
809	neg	Non-existent support which is too bad because logitech used to be so good
809	neg	Do not buy this mouse, pick just about anything else for a better experience
810	pos	Good mouse
810	pos	One tip though: the mouse did not work correctly with my old mousepad
810	pos	Apparently this mouse is a little picky with them
810	pos	Had to buy a new mouse pad and now it is more than fine
811	pos	I've always used the generic mouse's used for business, and most of them really are limited to what you can do with them, but with this mouse you have a lot of options and buttons to choose from
811	pos	Highly recommend getting this
812	pos	The best mouse for this price point and even 150 dollar mice
812	pos	Very ergonomic, has great quality, the G-Hub user interface is practically perfect, macros are easy enough to set up, and the price is really really great
812	pos	Overall one of my favorite mice to use on a day-to-day basis
813	neg	When you hook the mouse up, the dpi changes on its on a lot
813	neg	randomly
813	neg	the adjustment buttons are attatched to the left click of the mouse
813	neg	so thats genius as well
813	neg	after downloading the logitech hub to fix these problems, i turned off all ability to adjust the dpi on the mouse and discovered that it will randomly stop inputting and it will freeze for a second
813	neg	as a gaming mouse
813	neg	this is totally crazy as a design flaw
813	neg	what worse is i see these same complaints going back a few years, so they just don't care
813	neg	what an expensive paperweight this mouse is
814	neg	Mouse started off great, but literally days after Logitech's 2-year warranty the mouse would release left/right holds
814	neg	I've been a loyal customer since 2005, but Logitech's refusal to replace their blatantly faulty products has pushed me to Razer
814	neg	A $80 mouse should last much, much longer than 2 years
814	neg	I strongly suggest anyone looking at this mouse (or any Logitech product for that matter) to look elsewhere
815	pos	This is my second G502 I've been using this mouse for the last 6 years or so and love it
815	pos	Has all the features I need including programmable buttons an in the fly DPI reduction button, and you can customize the LED lighting, I also love the mouse wheel that can be unlocked
816	neg	Left to right, based on age, the one of the left is the only one that works without some sort of defect, it  is the oldest, before they cheapened it for mass production, the rest are junk
816	neg	I won't even get into the crap software, Logitech has 3 software platforms , Logitech G, G hub, and Logitech options
816	neg	The oldest app is the only semi-reliable one, but it doesn't find any new mice past the G502, least the ones I have, like the, MX vertical (options), and G903 (G Hub)
816	neg	I have at least 8 Logitech mice right now, I tried
817	pos	El mouse trabaja perfectamente súper bien,pero después de 2 mese de uso he estado teniendo problemas con el clip derecho ,cuando juego un shooter game que apunto al momento deja de hacerlo y después lo vuelve a hacer ,he buscando en youtube y he hecho todo lo posible por repararlo y nada ,pero a demás de eso es muy bueno para jugar
818	pos	First legit gaming mouse i've owned and i'm not disappointed
818	pos	Other than the software not showing up no matter how many times i troubleshoot it's a great mouse
818	pos	It may be a bit narrow as i have large hands i can not complain
818	pos	The numerous buttons to macro are phenomenal
818	pos	The mouse glides freely on my mousepad
818	pos	The mouse wheel is great
818	pos	I saw some reviews on how their mouse wheel "broke" and won't stop moving
818	pos	The button south of your wheel locks it in place or lets it free spin
818	pos	I love the free spin when i'm scrolling down a long internet page or searching for music
818	pos	Makes it easier
818	pos	Overall a great purchase and i would recommend
819	neg	Double click issue
819	neg	impossible to game with when the mouse Auto clicks every few seconds
819	neg	Total trash and that's where it went after I tried to repair myself
819	neg	They device should not even be allowed to be sold
819	neg	It is damaged out of the box
819	neg	AVOID
820	neg	Was not made to last
820	neg	In one year the left button stops working at times
820	neg	The worst for Shooters
820	neg	Thought it was good at first
820	neg	If you don't play shooters
820	neg	i guess wot will be ok
821	neg	Mouse is out of warranty
821	neg	Doubleclick issue is very real
821	neg	Annoying at best, but it can also cost you closed windows, deleted data, and more
821	neg	A serious problem for such an expensive mouse
821	neg	Worse, this issue has gone on for YEARS and Logitech, apparently, has no interest in fixing it
821	neg	Move on to another maker
822	pos	The Logitech G502 Hero is now my favorite mouse to use and I've owned a slew of different brands, the brilliant performance of this mouse gives me all the buttons I'll need, adjustable weights and the new software G Hub works flawlessly
822	pos	This is in my opinion the best wired gaming mouse one can buy
823	pos	The deal with Logitech products is that there is basically no warranty once the retailers return period (usually 30 days) ends
823	pos	There are literally hundreds of people trying to file warranty claims with no response
823	pos	No one ever responds to the cases online or answers the phone
823	pos	I made the mistake of buying this mouse after I found out that their warranty stinks
823	pos	I may return it just to buy something else
824	pos	I currently use a G402 and wanted to upgrade to a mouse with weights to improve play with my hand tremors
824	pos	Compared to the G402 wheel, the wheel on the G502 is large and "clunky
824	pos	" The feel and scrolling was inferior to the G402
824	pos	It also seems that there is farther space between the "clicks
824	pos	" In the 20 minutes or so I worked with it, I couldn't adjust
825	pos	The mouse itself is good, the software for it does not work, at all, it doesn't even detect the mouse making it useless as a gaming mouse
825	pos	Update: Use the Logitech G HUB software and not the Logitech Gaming software the instructions tell you to use
826	pos	Love this mouse more than any other i have owned
826	pos	Haven’t owned a wired mouse in ages, but the new PC build wasn’t working well with my wireless mouse & keyboard
826	pos	Doing CAD work and 3D model/ rendering workflow daily
826	pos	Only negative note was wanting to swap out the scroll wheel
826	pos	Easy solution via eBay and the slimmer typical scroll wheel swap people have done with this model
826	pos	Now I have the worlds most perfect mouse that is programmed to do so many things
826	pos	It allows me to work 20% faster
827	neg	This used to be my favorite mouse now it seems they make garbage I do not recommend left click double clicks and will not let you drag windows had mouse for 65 days got new mouse today from BenQ Zowie EC1
827	neg	Logitech used to make such long lasting good products guess that day is dead
828	pos	Could not of made a better choice buying this mouse
828	pos	It's super sensitive and feel great in the hand
828	pos	It won't make you better at games if that's what you think you need to be better is a better mouse
828	pos	It will shave milliseconds off response time but it won't make you a better shot
828	pos	😂
829	pos	Has what you need with a few extras, good software to customize DPI and button settingsRBG colors and automatically changes with supported games (most mainstream)Scroll Wheel is metal and cold to touch, has hyper scroll button
830	pos	Great device and easy to use
830	pos	But the software on a Mac sometimes leaves things to be desired
830	pos	But thats Logitech for you
830	pos	Mac is more of an afterthought it seems
830	pos	But the mouse itself is quite good, responsive, reads well and is easy adjustable
831	neg	Bought the mouse, side lights defected and wouldn’t work
831	neg	Didn’t care at first but if I pay my money I want everything working perfectly
831	neg	Ordered a replacement and I had the same exact issue with the SECOND mouse
831	neg	Side lights on the mouse is defected and won’t turn on, unless you unplug and plug your mouse back in, and at that point it’ll last for 2 minutes
831	neg	Googling it, many other people have had the same issue with this mouse
831	neg	Decent mouse but if I’m spending money on something I want it to come how it’s suppose to
832	neg	Had the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum for a long time, best mouse I’ve ever used
832	neg	Decided to upgrade to the HERO since I love the features of the Spectrum
832	neg	Bought on Amazon for $48 on sale
832	neg	Came used with finger prints all over the mouse feet, wheel, and the weights
832	neg	Normally I wouldn’t care but since this an everyday product for me, I returned it
832	neg	Ended up going to my local micro center and bought the same mouse for 9$ more
832	neg	At least I know this wasn’t an opened box item put into new packaging
833	neg	Double clicking started just 1 year of using
833	neg	Its really annoying and not usable anymore
834	pos	I gotta say I seriously love this mouse
834	pos	I upgraded from some off brand crappy mouse that was still decent but I felt like it really needed an upgrade and it was definitely worth every penny
834	pos	The colors are beautiful
834	pos	The mouse is super comfortable
834	pos	The DPI settings are customizable and you can switch through DPI settings so fast
834	pos	Worth the buy for sure
835	pos	The reason why I give 2 is because this mouse has just too many pointed/sharp edges, which I feel is bad in terms of ergonomics
835	pos	Also the clicky roll up down switch has a pretty sharp feedback
835	pos	Now all that is good for gaming and I understand that, but unfortunately I just couldn't use this mouse for reading purposes
835	pos	To all the gamers, this is an amazing mouse
835	pos	To people who do gaming and office work/reading, not really sure I would recommend it
836	neg	I actually really liked this mouse but it started developing a click issue on the left mouse button where it double clicks or releases while you're holding the button
836	neg	Makes drag and drop or selecting text nearly impossible
836	neg	After cleaning the mouse it still did this
836	neg	Next I searched online and found other people having the same issues and that it was pointing to a hardware issue
836	neg	It's great when it works but the low rating is because a mouse at this price range shouldn't break in 9 months
837	pos	I love everything about this mouse except for one quirk
837	pos	I play Counterstrike mostly
837	pos	When you hold down left click to shoot you have to pull down to compensate for recoil
837	pos	In a competitive match when it gets tense sometimes I will press left click too hard and the back end of the mouse will come off the pad
837	pos	Then when I go to pull down the mouse doesn't move at all because the sensor is off the pad
837	pos	It will cost me kills sometimes
837	pos	Other than that 10/10
838	pos	Arrived on time and undamaged
838	pos	I set it to where it reacts to the audio to get more fun out of it
838	pos	It's bulkier than the one I had before, noticed it's moving faster on the screen
838	pos	It's definitely a whole lot less laggy than the Redragon gaming mouse
838	pos	I like the thumb rest and extra buttons to create shortcuts
839	pos	This is the best gaming mouse I’ve bought
839	pos	It just feels right and with all the programmable buttons it makes it easier to play games
839	pos	Also with software installed you could literally customize it however you need
839	pos	I’ve also have the G-series pad and this mouse works very well combined with it
839	pos	The speed is amazing
839	pos	There are weights you can add
839	pos	I’ve always been a Logitech fan, and every time hasn’t failed me
839	pos	Best mouse ever
840	neg	Purchased this mouse to replace an old mouse that started with the double click issues after about 3 or so years
840	neg	I had that mouse a long time so I thought it was fine, I could get another mouse, but this mouse started having the double click issues on the left click and general clicking issues on the right click after only 4 months
840	neg	Contacting Logitech support to try to get this fixed is slow and that has just soured the whole experience for me
841	neg	The mouse feels great, but it causes issues with all of my games
841	neg	World of warcraft, mechwarrior 5, when i move the mouse, the games drop frames
841	neg	Moving using the keyboard is fine
841	neg	I changed mice, and I have no graphics issues
841	neg	Buyer beware
841	neg	Edit: raised to two stars because I was able to get it to work much better by lowering the poll refresh rate to the lowest setting
841	neg	It seems like it’s an industry thing because I bought a corsair mouse and had the same issue
842	pos	The mouse is a good mouse but the scroll wheel is so loose that I have to stick something on the side to be able to use it
842	pos	When it is working properly it is a very good mouse to use, the problem is it just doesn't work consistently
842	pos	Also the sensitivity seems to change on it's own
843	pos	Upgraded from a basic left click right click wheel mouse
843	pos	this thing is crazy with more buttons than i know what to do with
843	pos	i really enjoy being able to set the speed of my cursor an flip through my different settings for different tasks
843	pos	but the best feature is the Sniper Button
843	pos	being able to get to a target fast and then put your cursor in slow mo is the best part about this mouse for me
843	pos	highly recommend this mouse, had it for over a month now with zero issues
844	neg	This mouse would be fine if it didn't suffer from one fatal flaw: it constantly double-clicks when you attempt a single click
844	neg	Need to drag a window
844	neg	There's a chance it will shrink your window and then close it
844	neg	Selecting a piece of text is an absolute chore because it constantly double-clicks when you need a single click
844	neg	Gaming is ridiculous because there's no precision
844	neg	I've been trying to "live with it" for the past few months since I bought it until I can afford a mouse that isn't a POS but this stupid thing just closed what I was working on and I lost about an hour of work for my day job, because it double-clicks almost every time I try to do a single click, so now I'm writing this review
844	neg	Absolutely broken, DO NOT BUY
845	neg	The part in the manual about changing Profiles and DPI settings makes no sense
845	neg	Was it translated to English from  Mandarin
845	neg	I play warzone CoD and if I switch into windows and back into the game the DPI settings are all screwed up
845	neg	Nice mouse, horrible software/drivers
846	neg	This is the 3rd iteration of what is basically the same mouse
846	neg	Never buy this mouse at full 75 dollar price
846	neg	I've had two before and both have had trouble
846	neg	The first one where the side button broke and the second where the left click button started slipping to the left
846	neg	The build quality of the mouse is pretty poor and honestly has been getting worse over the 3 generations this mouse has had
846	neg	This will be the last Logitech mouse I buy
846	neg	EDIT the left mouse button is now double-clicking because of the  Omron switches this mousie uses
846	neg	I am applying for an RMA lets see what happens :(
847	neg	Pros: The buttons are easy to reach and I like how easy it is to customize
847	neg	Comfortable to hold
847	neg	Cons: The two primary buttons are glitchy
847	neg	They work fine for clicking, but try to drag-and-drop and it drops too early
847	neg	Both left and right buttons are like that
847	neg	It makes work and games very frustrating
847	neg	Barely lasted a year
847	neg	Better off with a $10 disposable mouse at that rate
848	pos	The logo always glows
848	pos	even when i set it to not glow with the downloaded settings program, if i put my computer to sleep, the computer stops running the settings program and then my mouse glows in the dark
848	pos	really annoyed by this because i did not want a glowing g shaped nightlight for my room, since my desk is right next to my bed
848	pos	really wish the settings program worked when my computer is asleep so i dont have to unplug my mouse all the time
849	pos	Soea what it is supposed to, it used to be switching dpi by itself which wasn't choosing the right one for the program being used, but I think I found how to disable it
850	pos	perfect size for my large hands, feels great once you put the max weights in it, the logitech G app is kind of a pain to figure out, game profiles are useless, just disable them and configure it manually
851	neg	This broke after less than a full; year of use
851	neg	Have tried to contact support - but after 20 minutes on hold , left message
851	neg	No return call that day or the following day
851	neg	Tried calling again - left on hold and gave up after 10 minutes
851	neg	I think my son was happy with it when it worked, but for nearly 80 dollars, it should last more than a year
852	neg	I never seen a mouse so, small as this one
852	neg	Must be made for a teenager, but not a 39 year old adult
852	neg	Guess, I will keep my old mouse until they make a new one like the G500 series
853	pos	ive had been using different mouses in my life BUT THIS is one of a kind
853	pos	its cool looking
853	pos	i like the whole weight added to it and the RGB lightning really makes my setup intense
853	pos	besides that as a gaming mouse its the best for shooters so far for me
853	pos	each one should experience what mouse is good for them but i myself totally prefer this one
853	pos	for me this mouse is a must by if youre a gamer
854	neg	Lower my rating even further after dealing with support
854	neg	Logitech has done everything they can think of to not honor the warranty on this faulty mouse
854	neg	I will never use another Logitech product again
854	neg	On top of a bad product, they have wasted many hours of my time
854	neg	Filthy
855	pos	Pros--RGB-Great feel-super responsive-unlockable scroll wheel-Great software-Nice sounding clicksCons--Not as large as the g602 which i was hoping it was due to my larger hands-Grease finger magnet
856	pos	Just upgraded from a cheaper product and WOW
856	pos	Huge difference
856	pos	I am new to gaming so learning the keyboard and mouse still
856	pos	Had grabbed a cheaper mouse first and after a week it was killing me
856	pos	Made it so much harder to learn with
856	pos	After receiving this I couldn't believe how much better it made the gameplay feel
856	pos	Well worth the extra buckets ;)
857	neg	I've used all of the troubleshooting methods, but the right-click is still being inconsistent
857	neg	To be more specific whenever I play FPS games, my aim is toggled, furthermore, my game looks like its switching back and forth throughout the game when aiming
857	neg	I've tried everything from reinstalling my drivers, binding different buttons, etc
857	neg	I've taken extremely good care of my mouse, but, for some reason, the mouse has given up on me, and I know for a fact that I have not reached the 20 million clicks you've advertised the mouse to last to
857	neg	Thank you for your time
858	pos	Had one of these for 4 years now and loved it
858	pos	Recently I started a new job and this mouse wasn't on the employer provided list
858	pos	I ended up buying a 2nd out of my own pocket because I love it so much
858	pos	The cord is light, braided and long enough that you never notice it
858	pos	Buttons are placed in seemingly the perfect locations that seem natural
858	pos	The customization through the logitech program is extensive
858	pos	Overall I dont have a desire to even try another mouse
859	neg	Very small mouse, doesn't want to sit flat, when you drag the mouse to the right it wants to roll over, only 2 of the 11 buttons are actually programable, the dpi adjustment buttons are too big and take up 1/3 of the space of the left mouse button, mouse 3-4 are way to far back you have to hold the mouse in a very awkward half contact position to access them
859	neg	F all around, horrible mouse
860	pos	This is a productivity beast, it has about 9-10 usable buttons, with one you can set as a modifier to double your programmable buttons to 18-20
860	pos	The software can be for specific app content as well
860	pos	So I have it orange for gaming and for my work
860	pos	My only complaint is the mouse software sometimes doesn’t wake from sleep and needs to be killed and restarted, in this case the basic functionality works but your macros aren’t viable
861	pos	I was doing some research before I bought this to my boyfriend
861	pos	After wfh the mouse click noise always annoying me
861	pos	Since I’m a pianist that I’m very sensitive with the noise
861	pos	We had several conversations about the mouse noise, however, after I bought this one, the trouble disappeared
861	pos	My boyfriend loves it
862	pos	This mouse has worked well, especially for the price
862	pos	Unfortunately at some point it started having issues where it would double click and the mouse button would stick
862	pos	If you click a bunch of times and apply pressure it goes away, however it's still an annoying issue to have for gaming
863	pos	The mouse has been great, smooth
863	pos	The weights are wonderful and precise, the customization is appreciated
863	pos	Everything works great, but sometimes randomly in games i will experience my player swing around in a random direction- just spin 360 degrees
863	pos	Sometimes it happens nonstop or consistently spaced apart in time
863	pos	And sometimes it happens once, and then never again
863	pos	It's weird, and it's definitely obnoxious when I'm in a competitive match
863	pos	Has gotten me killed more than once lol
864	pos	I will start by saying I have small hands and its a little too big for me
864	pos	I've had it for a couple of weeks and have learned how to place my hands so I can access all the buttons
864	pos	I really enjoy the ease of setting the "macro" buttons
864	pos	The subtle shape of the rounded part where your hand rests is very comfortable
864	pos	Other than the "getting to know you'' with the size, its everything I needed in a gaming mouse
864	pos	Over-all I am pleased with this mouse purchase :)
865	pos	I have tried many mice
865	pos	I had this one a while back (with the previous sensor version) and loved it but my dog got to the cord
865	pos	So I decided to try all the other "top" computer mice like the razer death adder (no idea who razer is paying to get this one on the list)
865	pos	But I eventually came back to this mouse
865	pos	I love the weight adjustments and the buttons are laid out perfectly for my hands
866	pos	This mouse looks good, feels good, and can adjust to any usage type
866	pos	This is not plug and play
866	pos	You’ll have to download G hub on your computer, but it gives you some pretty cool setting options
867	neg	Like other reviews have said(and I should have listened) this mouse has major issues with the mouse wheel and tracking, upon first using the mouse I saw that it had issues scrolling and took almost a full wheel revolution just to move up or down, so I would have to constantly spin the wheel over and over just to move inches at a time
867	neg	The mouse tracking was also off and would jump around, but the wheel was by far the most annoying issue
868	neg	Great features and ergonomics, but the infamous mouse clicking issue began after 6 months of use
868	neg	I first noticed that the right mouse button was releasing prematurely during right-click and drag about 50% of the time
868	neg	Now the left button is double-clicking on a single click 30-50% of the time
868	neg	I'm now using my 15-year old Logitech basic mouse that still works flawlessly
869	neg	Mouse has a great ergonomic shape and weight, but scroll wheel is awful
869	neg	Its made of metal and has almost no grip, so it slips around and is very imprecise
870	pos	Logitech still ranks top tier in gaming and the G502 is no exception
870	pos	The wheel is a real treat and the tactile feel between side to side motion is top notch
870	pos	Contours perfectly to my hand, ymmw
871	pos	Male with average sized hands, but I found this mouse to be too cramped with buttons
871	pos	After a week or 2 of trying to get used to it, I eventually had to disable the top 'G8' button, because I frequently misclicked it in games
871	pos	The left click button feels too small and narrow for my preferences at least
871	pos	I also never use the 'G4' button because it's too small and tucked too far behind my thumb
871	pos	Performed great otherwise, but definitely a warning that if you have larger hands this mouse may be too cramped to make use of all features
872	neg	I have had to replace this mouse a total of 4 times because after only a few months of use, the mouse starts to double click every time I single click
872	neg	I'm glad Logitech is sticking to their warranty and replacing it, but this is a joke
872	neg	I've been using Logitech for more than 15 years and there is no excuse for this poor quality
872	neg	Fix your switches or stop making mice
872	neg	Awful purchase
873	neg	This is made in the cheapest fashion possible
873	neg	Switches wore out after nine months of medium to light use and couldn't get a replacement
873	neg	The features are decent, the software is frustrating, the ergonomics are ok only
874	pos	Great mouse overall, not sure if this is a QA oversight or what
874	pos	The right click does not fully register makes it a pain when "aiming down sights" in any FPS game
874	pos	Love the mouse overall, just wish it would made it past a year of gaming
875	neg	The mouse performs basic functions, but the software used to edit mouse functionality (Logitech G Hub) is not yet compatible with Mac OS Big Sur 11
875	neg	6
875	neg	It's essentially a high-tech paperweight without access to G Hub
876	pos	Best gaming mouse I've ever owned
876	pos	So good I have 2 extras still unopened in case my main ever breaks, and have bought them for friends and family who needed a new (or better) mouse
876	pos	Love it
876	pos	Easily worth the money
877	pos	I've bought my fair share of those "Gaming" mice with all of their fancy colors, designs, buttons, and whatnot
877	pos	They don't compare at all
877	pos	It was well worth the money I spent on this
877	pos	If you like a heavy mouse, this is the way to go
877	pos	It's got all you'll ever need for a great gaming experience
878	pos	I always found gaming mice handy in design work due to so many programmable keys that you can map to your day to day routine plus you can select more than one profile which gives you a lot of potential
878	pos	Also you can manipulate DPI which is something important for photoshop, illustrator, figma, etc
879	neg	I really liked this mouse
879	neg	Then the right click mouse sensor stopped working consistently
879	neg	I use this for gaming and it really sucks using it now
879	neg	It is just out of the return time frame on Amazon so I guess I will try reaching logitech
879	neg	Talked to other friends who game and they confirmed that they had similar issues with Hero mouses
880	pos	It’s a good quality mouse, I fixed one for a friend and just from testing it I wanted to get one for myself
880	pos	It’s good for the games I play, but precise enough for FPS games
880	pos	Weight can be added to make it heavier which I like, and the scroll wheel can be locked or unlocked so it scrolls freely which is great for scrolling through many pages
881	pos	I got this for my son for Christmas
881	pos	He's only had it for about 2 weeks or so now but loves it so far
881	pos	It was one of his favorite gifts he received
882	neg	This mouse is known to be reliable over everything else
882	neg	Due to the reputation it has carried through the years I did not feel the need to read into it as much as I would for a mouse I have never heard of but beware
882	neg	Turns out there is a huge issue with the LM button double clicking when you click once
882	neg	It makes it UNUSABLE
882	neg	I edit video, audio, and play video games and the frustration of doing any of those things with a double clicking mouse is unmatched
882	neg	I've had the thing for 3 months
882	neg	I have been in the warranty process with Logitech for two months now and it is still NOT resolved
882	neg	The hoops you jump through are almost not worth a replacement
882	neg	If I ordered a $10 mouse I would not be as livid but FIFTY DOLLARS
882	neg	Stay clear of this product
882	neg	That's all I can say
882	neg	Everything was great subtracting the most basic function of a mouse: to click stuff
883	neg	I jumped through the hoops, downloaded the G Hub so I could check for firmware updates
883	neg	Updated the firmware and it did not fix the physical button defects in my mouse
883	neg	Seeing plenty of other reviews saying the exact same thing
883	neg	I used to swear by Logitech, guess it's time I move on
884	pos	I received this mouse in march of 2019
884	pos	Nothing has changed it still feels like i just got it out of the box, this mouse is very  durable
884	pos	it has 8 programmable buttons as well as a ability to change the scroll wheel from slow to endless
884	pos	You can change the RGB in the very complicated G hub but once yo figure it out it is very rewarding and has almost endless features
884	pos	The mouse also comes with weights even though it is heavy by itself
884	pos	But a heavy or light mouse does not matter when you have a dpi above 800 in my opinion
884	pos	Very great mouse it definitely deserves to be as popular as it is
884	pos	5/5
885	pos	I'm a person who will research days on end to find what makes me feel like a good fair purchase and honestly, I wish I pulled the trigger quicker with this mouse
885	pos	It's affordable, super light (comes with weights if needed), fits my large hands perfectly, and reacts quickly to my movements
885	pos	Would recommend 100%
886	pos	I have stayed away from Logitech for over 10 years
886	pos	Everything I have owned of theirs would break so fast
886	pos	This mouse has been amazing
886	pos	It feels good
886	pos	The app works well so you can macro it
886	pos	And you can write Lua scripts for it using Logitech’s API
887	neg	I really expected something more
887	neg	The quality of the mouse itself it's good but the mouse grip or sliders are terrible
887	neg	I received it today and after 1 hour of playing, one of the sliders came off and now this mouse feels just terrible, besides it just keeps scratching my mouse pad
888	pos	Got this on sale for about half off, which is nice becausey old G502 needed it's left mouse button replaced
888	pos	This is just like the old one with some quality of life improvements, especially being able to add weights
888	pos	There's a reason this has been among the top mice for years now
888	pos	If you can afford spending a little extra on a mouse, it doesn't get much better in this price range
889	pos	I actually bought this for work, not for gaming
889	pos	The extra functions and macros save me so much time and keyboard clicks
889	pos	Can't recommend this enough
889	pos	*Note there are different software options to change button config
889	pos	I liked "Logitech Gaming Software 9
889	pos	02
889	pos	65" better than the one off the Logitech product page
889	pos	Button config and creating macros is easy
890	pos	Solid premium product don't waste time with those cheap fancy looking no name brands
890	pos	This is an excellent mouse for animation or post production work, and that script feature gives the edge in COD and Battlefield games
891	neg	The mouse in and of itself is a wonderful piece of technology and with the appropriate software you can customize it and make it your own, which is all well and good when it works
891	neg	Chances are, however, that the switches inside will probably bork and you'll develop issues with the left click where you will have difficulty double-clicking or click-and-dragging stuff, which definetly becomes a problem when you're trying to play a game with the damn thing
892	pos	Been using this mouse (G502 Hero) for several years and love it for my gaming
892	pos	11 buttons that are easy to use with out hitting the wrong one
892	pos	Would like it to be just a little bit bigger, larger hands make it feel a bit small, but that's usually the case
893	pos	Even with all the weights installed, this thing is pretty light weight
893	pos	The scroll and movement are very smooth and the cord is so light if feels cordless
893	pos	The software isn't the most intuitive but makes this mouse highly customizable
893	pos	I have large dual monitors and at roughly half the capable sensitivity I can get from one side to the other with a flick of the wrist
894	neg	I bought this for my 14-year-old son, who had worked to earn it
894	neg	I presumed it was fine, but last night I asked how he was enjoying it and he said I can't use it
894	neg	Apparently, it came with a couple of manufacturer defects
894	neg	The bottom outside corner of the mouse trackpad (a gel-like surface) is not smooth, which affects the speed, action, and accuracy during gaming
894	neg	Additionally, it came wiith a very sharp burr in the same location that had damaged his mouse pad when he tried to use it
894	neg	I tried gently to take a soft nail file to the burr, hoping it might help, but it was not an effective solution, as the gel-like surface began to lift at the location of the burr
894	neg	My
895	neg	After a little over a year of use, the left mouse button starts malfunctioning
895	neg	When I try to hold the left button and drag the mouse, it just released the button by itself
895	neg	And sometimes doesn't respond when I click
896	pos	i had the previous version, without the hero sensor and logitech hit it out of the park
896	pos	great response quality and feel
896	pos	have had no issues getting it to track on any material
896	pos	its just a great mouse for gaming over all
897	pos	My Razer Naga broke prior to purchasing this mouse and for someone with fairly large hands and a "claw" grip the ergonomics and button-placement are some of my favorite features
897	pos	The scroll-wheel is a nice to have
897	pos	Software is great
897	pos	I run three profiles offline that are saved to the physical mouse so if I change computers my settings are there
897	pos	My only complaint is it's a bit heavy for a gaming mouse especially if you play at low DPI (I play at 400) so grabbing a mouse bungee like the Zowie Camade makes a big difference
898	neg	Got this mouse because my old G700 was showing its age
898	neg	Figured I could use logitech again since they dont make the G700's anymore
898	neg	The two big things are the software and the double click
898	neg	The software is a bit clunky to use and there is no dedicated Push To Talk button
898	neg	The mouse left click after about 6 months of use it now registers a double click which makes some interfacing atrocious
899	pos	Amazing Mouse
899	pos	I’m not a gamer but I design and needed a good comfortable mouse
899	pos	The weights option was awesome
899	pos	It keeps my motion more even
899	pos	My daughter and son who are gamers have them and love them
900	pos	Holy cow this thing is awesome
900	pos	You can make profiles for different games and link them to the game file so when you open it the mouse automatically switches to that games preferences
900	pos	I love this mouse and it's exactly what I wanted
901	pos	Its perfect, perfect weight[because you can adjust, perfect ergonomics
901	pos	Perfect fit, perfext sensitivity, perfect sleek look not too tlashy but still has some futuristic leds, best of all perfect software to detail customize your mouse and the price is under $100, i had a g300s before and it lasts forever logitech makes durable mice
901	pos	Id recommend this to everyone and id buy it again after when i need a new mouse
902	neg	Everyone talks about how there is a double clicking issue
902	neg	I wish my mouse for that far in its week or two life of being used
902	neg	The mouse doesn't even work and I'm not doing puzzles moving the cable every which way to "fix" it
902	neg	Can't really say much else other then the lights are pretty when they worked with the games and maybe spend more in a wireless one
902	neg	Can't suggest Logitech or razor since I'm having issues with both my mice from them (this one was my newest)
903	neg	First, the mouse feels like it is made from cheap plastic
903	neg	very light although the weights help
903	neg	The deal breaker was out of the box 3 buttons were not registering clicks
903	neg	The new Logitech software is unwieldy and hard to use
903	neg	in no way is it intuitive
903	neg	Stick with Razer if you are looking for a mouse Logitech has gone way down hill
904	neg	wouldent work on uplay with breakthrough, my next game is going to be farcry 6 and I think I will just stay with my older mouse and save the frustration
905	pos	This mouse is outstanding
905	pos	The buttons are easily programmable for macroing
905	pos	I carry this mouse daily in a side pocket of a backpack and it gets knocked around a fair amount, it has held up VERY well
905	pos	The size is perfectly ergonomic for an average male hand
906	neg	I got it for the nice scrolling and side scroll buttons
906	neg	The biggest issue with it is that the cursor sometimes slips and throws off my accuracy
906	neg	It was very frustrating when it happens
907	neg	got this mouse because my old mouse's scrollwheel is broken and ive been wanting a new mouse for awhile
907	neg	Its not too bad except for the scroll wheel IT WILL MOVE IF YOU SLIGHTLY JITTER MOUSE
907	neg	It's insane how often ive lost in games thanks to this mouse in an intense firefight i move my mouse but if i move it too fast im suddenly switching weapons
907	neg	That and there is no customization options for this mouse the drivers you get just run it on your computer unlike other gaming mice theres no way to set marco's or custom dpi settings or anything like that
907	neg	Guess ill just buy a 2nd mouse like the one i had before
908	neg	Could have been a great mouse slightly wider and if that uncomfortable sniper button was gone
908	neg	Why place a button where your thumb rests for proper control
908	neg	This needs to be redesigned to mimic the G700 which is no longer sold
909	neg	This is the 2nd one of these I have ordered, and the first ones right-click went out within almost exactly 3 months as well
909	neg	Never had this problem with the G502 none Hero edition, very disappointed in this quality of this mouse
910	pos	I love this mouse, and think it is an amazing mouse
910	pos	the customizable weight set lets you balance it beautifully for a more tailored experience
910	pos	The DPI settings are customizable for all 5 setpoints
910	pos	There is just 1 issue I have with it and it might just be how I hold the mouse
910	pos	Occassionally when I left click on the mouse it triggers the increase DPI mouseclick as well (I might also be hitting the button) so as you can imagine no matter what I'm doing I end up at max DPI settings
911	pos	Don't buy any other mouse
911	pos	Unless you want wireless
911	pos	But hey we want low latency right
911	pos	Seriously I don't know what took me so long to get this mouse
911	pos	It's quiet, responsive, and sleek to boot
911	pos	No problems for gaming or everyday use
911	pos	Worth every penny
912	neg	Bought this mouse last year around June, started having issues with double clicking around 6 months in
912	neg	Issue was not happening often but was noticeable and disappeared for a while
912	neg	Here I am, using the mouse for about 1 year and a month and now its fully double clicking everything all the time
913	pos	Corded mice is the only way to get zero latency
913	pos	Once I organized my mouse cord properly, this thing is a dream
913	pos	It's easy to program, too
914	neg	Came wonky
914	neg	Slightest nudge on usb makes it disconnect
914	neg	Stuck with it because I liked the mouse otherwise and am to busy to deal with returning / researching a replacement
914	neg	After just a few months of moderate use the buttons gave out and I am no longer able to click and drag or even long click
915	pos	I love this mouse for how button-rich it is, for its software, for its build quality, for the 2-mode wheel
915	pos	I just can't get over the fact how narrow it is
915	pos	It is long for big hands, but why so narrow
915	pos	what is my pinky supposed to, should I cut it off
915	pos	Questions, questions
916	pos	While the mouse itself is generally fine, over the past year and a half of using it, the G Hub software (the software required to customize the mouse-button functions) frequently fails to recognize the application being used
916	pos	This had never happened to me when I was using my Razer mouse (which I bought the Logitech to replace it)
916	pos	As a result, I wish I had stuck with the Razer mouse instead
917	pos	Disappointed this didn't work longer
917	pos	Wouldn't drag photos, wouldn't highlight words, crop, etc
917	pos	Frustrating
917	pos	Trying a different brand this time
918	pos	Logitech has really made the ultimate mouse this time
918	pos	I loved my old mouse and still use it for my old system
918	pos	But this one is everything a mouse should be
918	pos	Don't look any further
918	pos	This is as good as it gets
919	neg	The mouse wheel started jumping around after finishing scrolling
919	neg	It is unusable for more than a few minutes as have to try and fine tune and get just right to get a page where you want it on the screen
920	pos	Purchased this to replace my old g502 mouse
920	pos	Only complaint is that the original g502 software that over used for the last 5 years doesnt work for this mouse, it doesnt even detect it's plugged in
920	pos	Had to rummage around through a slightly confusing website & keep trying things until I found one that worked to re-assign my keys to the mouse
921	pos	I was expecting it to feel cheap because logitech
921	pos	but to my surprise it's actually quite nice
921	pos	The materials used to make it do a great job of making it feel premium and the shape mouse fits really well with the resting position of my hand
921	pos	I would give tis mouse a 10 out of 10 for design and comfort
922	pos	I have a larger hand and this has a great feel and doesn’t make my hand cramp up
922	pos	I can set the different buttons to function as needed
922	pos	I am an avid gamer and for the price feel like this is one of the best you can get
922	pos	Looks exactly as shown and works just as described
922	pos	Definitely something I suggest to friends and others looking for a great functioning product
923	pos	What can I say
923	pos	This mouse replaced my cheap 10 dollar wireless mouse
923	pos	World of difference
923	pos	Plenty of customization's an you don't have to go online to get it to work unlike another company I wont mention here
924	pos	I replaced my old G402 mouse with this, and am extremely happy with my purchase so far
924	pos	The mouse comfortably fits my hand, the buttons are easy to reach/use
924	pos	The adjustable weight is a nice touch, as I can weight the mouse to my preference for a heavier feel
924	pos	The RGB can be turned off, which I like
924	pos	16,000 DPI is probably overkill, but it's great to never feel like I need more DPI than the mouse can provide
925	pos	I like almost everything about this mouse
925	pos	The one thing that I dislike is the mousewheel is free rolling, and that one thing makes it a real pain in the backside
926	pos	I had a razer death adder mouse before and bought this as a replacement
926	pos	I am very happy with the mouse
926	pos	It is really high quality
926	pos	Love the design
926	pos	Had a couple of long game seshs and it works perfect
926	pos	The scroll wheel had a lock to let it fly or keep it clicky
926	pos	The weights are easy to adjust
926	pos	This is the coolest mouse ive owned
926	pos	10/10 would recommend
927	pos	Well built
927	pos	I use it for CAD rather than gaming
927	pos	The software is problematic on the Mac
927	pos	I finally had to pair it with Steermouse - a 3rd party driver
927	pos	But the mouse itself is excellent
928	pos	I didn’t think I was going to like this mouse but my boyfriend insisted that weighted mice are just night and day from my current razor mouse
928	pos	I gave it a try and man was he right
928	pos	It’s so smooth and clean and perfect for gaming
928	pos	This will be my mouse until the internet be of time
929	pos	This mouse is great for productivity
929	pos	I’ve assigned the buttons to run macro in my Excel workbooks, and can quickly drill down on accounts and pull Journal Entries without having to use alt keys
929	pos	10/10 would recommend for a home/work office
930	pos	I've used the Logitech G600 for work and this, the G502 for my personal computer as well as several m510's in the past
930	pos	Logitech build quality is consistently great, and this mouse does not disappoint
930	pos	It performs well, the free scroll feature is very satisfying to use on long documents or internet pages, and the logitech software is second to none (having used the corsair iCue as well)
930	pos	The adjustable weight is my favorite part; the mouse feels very well balanced with a little bit of weight
930	pos	If the wireless version weren't so expensive, I would go for that, but this is a perfectly good mouse in terms of features and feel and I highly recommend it
931	pos	Smooth action with precise feel
931	pos	Nice build
931	pos	Good for gaming and for everyday use
931	pos	A HUGE improvement over the commodity mouse I was using
932	neg	Within the first year it started to suffer from the double-click plague
932	neg	Just suddenly starts registering half of single clicks as double clicks
932	neg	Even dragging items because frustrating as it will release the item too soon
932	neg	Tried numerous solutions aside from tearing the thing apart and manually replacing switches
932	neg	Not what I buy a mouse for
932	neg	Not a hard core gamer
932	neg	Mostly an MMO player which puts stress on the keyboard and right mouse
932	neg	Left should not have gone out this quickly
932	neg	Seems pretty rampant with Logitech mice so I will try another brand
933	neg	Mouse worked well for 10 months then the left button started acting up
933	neg	Double clicking and not holding a click
933	neg	When I tried for example outlining text or click and dragging something was all but impossible
933	neg	Its getting to the point of near useless now so I will be returning to Logitech and see how the return policy is
933	neg	I'll edit the review after a replacement
933	neg	I liked it up to this point
934	pos	I haven't used it for much gaming yet but this is an amazing mouse at first glance
934	pos	If there are any problems i shall update this review, but at the moment this is one of the best additions to my set up
935	pos	I purchased this gaming mouse not for myself, but for my boyfriend
935	pos	He loves gaming with his friends and I had no idea which mouse would be good to get him
935	pos	At first he has to get used to the size of the mouse, since he had always head bigger ones -- but once he adjusted he loved it
935	pos	I really wanna get one for myself
935	pos	Unfortunately I can't write a detailed review about what it's like to use/play with, but he did love it for his games (League, Valorant, Apex Legends, Minecraft, Among Us, etc)
936	pos	Only had it for a day, but thus far this is the best mouse I've owned
936	pos	Great for gaming, but also great for just general computing
936	pos	It has a very premium feel to it, and I love the scroll wheel
937	pos	Can't even describe how much of a game changer this was for my everyday use
937	pos	Everything about this mouse has improved my experience on PC
937	pos	I'm glad I got it on sale too
938	pos	After years of daily gaming, my son finally wore out an older version of this mouse, so when he was presented with the replacement, he was thrilled
938	pos	It's pretty much a perfect gaming mouse, a great buy
939	pos	Overall a great mouse with programmable buttons, easy to use software that lets you assign macros
939	pos	If you want the most comfortable mouse for palm grip, Corsair Ironclaw would be a much better choice, but the scroll wheel on the Logitech is surprisingly good
940	pos	Great mouse for gaming
940	pos	Has enough buttons for the commands I need
940	pos	Demands a little bit inventive-ness to properly use with healbot, but can be made to work
941	pos	I bought this mouse about 9 months ago, and for most of that time it worked flawlessly
941	pos	However, after not even a year of use, the right and left click buttons started acting up
941	pos	Now, a short time later, they barely work at all
941	pos	I think this is due to the use of cheap materials used in the button switches
941	pos	Now I have to buy a new mouse
941	pos	During the time that it did work I loved this mouse, but now I definitely would not recommend anyone to buy it, unless you want to buy another one in less than a year
942	pos	I really liked this mouse, and everything about it
942	pos	it feels nice in my hand, which is about 8' and it controls nicely too
942	pos	However, this is a very heavy mouse, and the sliders (skates
942	pos	idk) on the bottom aren't great
942	pos	with the weight and the quality of the skates, making small and precise movements were hard
942	pos	I ended up using this mouse for a month or two and then bought a Glorious model D that I am much more satisfied with
943	neg	I really enjoyed using this mouse
943	neg	The first one I received started having the switch issues about 9mo into ownership
943	neg	Getting a replacement was very fast and straightforward that time
943	neg	The replacement started having the same issues about 6mo later
943	neg	And this time, support takes about a week between responses and makes you jump through hoops like going to 3rd party websites, taking videos of yourself using the mouse, all to try to get you to give up on your case
943	neg	Then at the end, only to be told your replacement is out of stock
943	neg	Save yourself the hassle and get something else
944	neg	I first purchased this product in June/July 2019, and until recently it would have received a solid 4 or 5 stars, but unfortunately the primary left click sensor seems to be dying, as now the mouse will sometimes not register a click at all, or double click, or it will click and then suddenly release without actually letting go, etc
944	neg	A bit disappointing, served me well enough while it worked but my next purchase will likely be an alternative product
945	pos	I've got big hands
945	pos	Using most mice for any significant amount of time becomes uncomfortable
945	pos	This is where this mouse comes in
945	pos	It's large enough and ergonomic enough that I can use it for hours without discomfort
946	pos	It’s been quite accurate and consistent
946	pos	For my hand it’s not ergonomic
946	pos	I can see it being more ergonomic for someone with smaller hands but not for bigger hands
947	pos	Bought as a gift for my son
947	pos	he said it takes a bit of fine tuning the weights ,but, once dialed in
947	pos	he says it is the best mouse he's ever used
948	pos	Great mouse
948	pos	I love the weights; they actually make a difference
948	pos	Plenty of buttons for me (even for Star Citizen)
948	pos	I highly recommend
949	neg	Lasted 5 month and now the left click is miss clicking all the time
949	neg	I can't drag anything because it somehow unclicks the image or item that I'm holding
949	neg	Thought Logitech was a good brand, now a cheap Chinese mouse is comparable to their prodcuts
950	pos	Love the mouse, it’s great for gaming
950	pos	Easy to use and has great response
950	pos	Happy with purchase
950	pos	I would recommend
951	pos	I love the mouse it is great for fps
951	pos	The sensitivity adjustments are perfect, I really did not need to download the software because it was already perfect because i got  everything I needed on the mouse I highly recommend it for gamers that play FPS games
951	pos	I also like the color and rgb on the G letter on the mouse It is a perfect design
952	neg	This use to be the best mosue out there, but holy crap the plastic is so flimsy and the LMB and RMB buttons break within months now compared to back then where they took years to wear out
952	neg	Logitech stopped using good sources for their materials and cut a deal with China instead and now their mice are crap
952	neg	It's a shame because it's an amazing shape for a mouse, comfy, good looking, and hella good for games
952	neg	But they break so damn quick
953	pos	This would be the perfect mouse if it didn't attract dirt like a magnet
953	pos	Constantly having to clean it off
953	pos	Great mouse other than that
953	pos	Love the scroll lock feature
954	neg	The mouse has to use a download the fine tune the operating speed of the mouse, the default is the hight setting
955	pos	Very good for if you grab the entire mouse with your palm
955	pos	My hands are medium/large for a guy
955	pos	I use my fingertips to hold the mouse, though, so it's not the most ergonomic and I find it rather difficult to press any of the extra thumb buttons because of that
955	pos	The software (G HUB) it comes with allows extensive customization and mapping of keys -- including combination of keys -- to almost any buttons
955	pos	A little bit of a resource hog, though, as my mid/low end laptop can attest to
955	pos	I'm glad I bought it despite the fit not being the best for my hand
956	neg	When I opened the box I was just so Disgusted of the product
956	neg	Idk why or how this mouse is supposed to be new got this way but that’s just nasty look at the picture
956	neg	What
956	neg	Didn’t get to test it didn’t even touch it how dirty it was
957	pos	This is a rebuy after running its older brother into the ground with years and years of gaming
957	pos	Comfortable, reliable, has many many configurable buttons, solid and looks like a space ship
957	pos	I love it
958	pos	As someone who needs the ability to have keybinds for games on my mouse, this mouse checked all boxes
958	pos	very ergonomic design, customizable RGB lighting, and plenty of assignable buttons with great placement
958	pos	admittedly somewhat heavy compared to most modern gaming mice, it still pairs well with a hard mouse pad like the G440
958	pos	I recently upgraded to the wireless version which is actually lighter than this one, and I may never buy a new mouse other than a replacement G502 again
959	pos	I use it for CAD, and it's sufficient for this
959	pos	I don't like it as much for gaming because the resolution is still too high at it's lowest setting
959	pos	I also don't like that the door that opens for the installation of the weights is magnetically sealed
959	pos	It sometimes opens up in my backpack and I have to search for it
960	pos	It’s got so many different buttons on it imma have to watch a YouTube video to make sure I’m using all the features this mouse has to offer
961	pos	This is a really solid mouse
961	pos	I used it for a week or 2 and was very happy
961	pos	The big reason I ended up not keeping it was it is very heavy compared to my g pro wireless even without added weights
961	pos	This added weight introduced some strain to my wrist
961	pos	This is very subjective but worth mentioning
962	pos	Being able to toggle the DPI sensitivity on the fly, adjust the mouse 'roller' wheel, and other things were unexpected
962	pos	Overall, very happy with this mouse
963	pos	This has been an absolutely fantastic mouse
963	pos	Pros:- It fits the hand well- Scroll wheel has been my favorite thing, very nice feeling and easy to control- It has extra buttons for gaming or to quickly change the movement speed- It can illuminate in sync with keyboards and all thatCons:- none
964	neg	The scroll wheel stinks
964	neg	Either you let it free wheel where it will register up and down motions if you breath near it
964	neg	Or you have to develop calluses due to the strength needed to make the wheel click
965	pos	On steroids
965	pos	This thing is seriously amazing
965	pos	Very customizable and works like a champ
965	pos	No issues and would highly recommend
966	pos	I like how all the buttons feel and the color changing on the G is a great feature
966	pos	The wheel has 2 different types of scrolls and the smoother one can go a little crazy when you scroll it too fast
966	pos	You can add weights to the mouse as well
966	pos	Altogether a great mouse for the price
967	pos	I was previously using some dinky 5 button mouse that I thought worked well enough but the difference this mouse made was night and day
967	pos	Way too light for me without the weights but I do like the options
967	pos	Will be using this mouse for the foreseeable future
968	pos	I upgraded from a Redragon S101 combo pack mouse to this
968	pos	I definitely think that I did get an upgrade with this mouse
968	pos	I like having the scroll wheel speed toggle, because you don't want a flywheel whilst gaming
968	pos	It does have alot more responsiveness than my old mouse, which should be expected from this kind of mouse
968	pos	I did have some trouble with the Logitech G Hub, but after re-installing it it worked
968	pos	Overall, I would recommend this mouse
969	pos	The adjustable weights give me just the right feel when gaming or just using regularly
969	pos	I like having plenty of macros to work with in games, and this does the job really nicely
969	pos	Syncs with the Logitech G app so I have my mouse function profiles sync with my headphones so they match color
969	pos	Good handling and I like all the customization
970	pos	G502 is the best mouse on the market from the design to feel to hardware
970	pos	Highest DPI I could find
970	pos	I maxed out the dpi, and I low the smoothness
971	neg	Honestly the worst decision I ever made was buying this junk
971	neg	This mouse in no way fits my hand, even when i claw grip it I am finding my self hold the mouse awkwardly and completely wrong for any style gaming
971	neg	If it had an alternate side which allowed me to rest my third finger and grip with my pinky it would be better
971	neg	sensor is definitely better than my roccat but every thing else is just worse
971	neg	even the software is worse than the swarm
971	neg	just sad for a highly recommended mouse
972	neg	As soon as I opened the box I knew I was returning this mouse
972	neg	Quality of the Teflon glide strips is junk
972	neg	I can tell it will be messed up in no time at all
972	neg	One pad was already pulled up in the corner out of the box
972	neg	All but one look thin and cheap
972	neg	Good eurgonamics but I didnt play with it cause I want something that will last
973	neg	Wow, what a God awful product
973	neg	I have bought 3 of these(stupid of me I know) and all of them end up having the right or left click button not be able to be held down
973	neg	Ruining all fps games
973	neg	Piece of junk
973	neg	BUY ANYWHERE ELSE I would call in the warranty but I don't want another piece of junk
973	neg	What a waste of space
973	neg	Zero stars
973	neg	Will never buy Logitech again
974	neg	My husband and I both have this mouse we got them probably a year or more apart and we both started having issues with the left button at the same time
974	neg	We've updated firmware and cleaned out everything and the issues remain
975	pos	Realmente es muy muy buen mouse, aparte de que su precio esta super bien, me ha gustado mucho como rinde tanto para tareas diarias como para juegos y edición de video
975	pos	Es un poco pesado pero esta muy bien
975	pos	Con los 11 botones que tiene no tengo idea a que asignarlos pero son muy útiles sobre todo para copiar, pegar eliminar, etc
975	pos	Otra cosa es el scroll infinito, es muy útil para archivos muy largos
975	pos	Lo que mas me gusta del g502 son los perfiles que puedes crear y configurar en el software de Logitech
976	pos	Ghub is hot garbage
976	pos	I hate it with a passion
976	pos	Might not be so bad for people who only want light customization, but even then It'll give you a headache
976	pos	Again
976	pos	Great mouse, terrible, terrible software
976	pos	Terrible
977	pos	I like the mouse
977	pos	It has a lot of buttons which you can program to do whatever you want through logitech g hub
977	pos	However, it could just be how I’m holding the mouse, the back feels a bit off
977	pos	Then again I have some pretty small hands
977	pos	Either way it’s a good mouse
978	neg	I dont know how this mouse has so many positive reviews
978	neg	Coming from a long time G500 with 3 close knit thumb buttons, the g502 is trash
978	neg	Your palm constantly has to reposition to be able to hit all 3
978	neg	You either sit your palm back to have two accessible thumb buttons or you move to the front side to have access to the front two buttons
978	neg	Also these buttons feel tacky and cheap mostly due to the sharp edge style they went for instead of rounded buttons that dont stick out as much
979	neg	Their is a lot to love about this mouse, the buttons are in just the right place and the scroll wheel i very fun
979	neg	But it broke on me after 2 years
979	neg	The mouse started to have this double click issue, it makes games like Minecraft unplayable because I can’t eat or use my shield
979	neg	Web browser is also a nightmare as I would close or open one tab then delete 2 by mistake
980	pos	I love the extra two buttons to the left of the left click button
980	pos	Those buttons combined with the 3 on the side are more than enough for most of my games hotkeys
980	pos	It is super responsive and the GHub logitech software is super clean and nice to use
981	neg	Received this on the date of of review
981	neg	Tried to give this bad boy a spin and found the right click was unresponsive and the clicking was null
981	neg	I've issued an exchange for a new one to see if that helps
981	neg	The review will change upon me receiving a new version
981	neg	As of now though, I wouldn't purchase this one
982	neg	None of the advertised features (customizable DPI, colors, etc) work unless you install Logitech's "G HUB" software
982	neg	And that software is extremely buggy
982	neg	Mine gets stuck in the loading screen unless I uninstall, reinstall the software + mouse drivers
982	neg	and if I ever restart my computer, it is stuck again
982	neg	If you close the software, all your mouse settings immediately become disabled
982	neg	I contacted Logitech's support, and they provided one solution that didn't work
982	neg	I am never buying Logitech peripherals again
983	pos	The mouse is great on all counts, but I like the custom weigh system
983	pos	Some mice feel cheap and too light
983	pos	You can add or remove weights in the bottom for the perfect feel and movement
984	pos	"lowest" DPI setting still isn't low enough
984	pos	The quality of the components is better than most mice, and the sensor is excellent
984	pos	But, even at the lowest setting the mouse moves too fast
985	pos	This is one of my favorite mice's to play games in the computer
985	pos	Very ergonomic, materials are really good quality and the usability it just feel natural
985	pos	Love it
985	pos	Got it also with a nice discount
986	neg	err done broke
986	neg	wont register the right and left scroll wheel clicks
986	neg	I have redownloaded the software, undid the binds
986	neg	Nothing is fixing it
986	neg	I dont even think i have had this mouse for two months yet and i dont even use it full time
986	neg	I switch between it and my Razer Basilisk
987	pos	I have been using this model of mouse for years
987	pos	Work and Gaming
987	pos	Superb
987	pos	My son whom is a competition gamer uses this mouse and loves it
987	pos	Need I say more
987	pos	okay I will
987	pos	Built like a tank and works like one the finest luxury rides you can get on the market
987	pos	You will not go wrong with this Logitech gear
988	pos	fast mouse - the micro program i cant get it to save to the mouse  memory profile to take to another pc - but it will work on the pc you program it too -as default
989	pos	its a good mouse but I don't think there is a way to turn the light off without unplugging the mouse (maybe there is and I just haven't found it) but once you get used to it the mouse is easy to use
990	pos	Great mouse fits like a glove
990	pos	high quality, not as heavy as expected
991	pos	i have always been a fan of logitech mouse, the gaming mouse continues that with its value and workmanship
992	pos	The mouse without weights is already a bit heavier than most, but it doesnt feel like I'm gonna break it like I did with the G pro, very comfortable for long gaming sessions and the Ghub makes it simple to set different keyboards for a solid amount of major titles
993	pos	Can't say I use it for gaming much since I still use controller but it looks cool and feels much better than a regular mouse
993	pos	Very comfortable and doesn't break the bank
994	pos	This is a massive upgrade from the gaming mouse I just had
994	pos	The software is better, but I will say that it is slightly small for my hand
994	pos	Slightly
994	pos	The customization for the buttons is incredible and I really enjoy that I was able to add all the weights to give it some heft
994	pos	As with all things, I would recommend trying this guy out before committing
995	pos	The level of frustration hase increased to epic levels after several months of use
995	pos	The right mouse button issue you read about is real and will give you nightmares
996	pos	If you don't use the macro settings for hotkeys, this is the one you want
996	pos	If you're looking to set up hotkey macros, get the expensive one
997	pos	I have been using this mouse for a day and I have noticed that this mouse is great, however this mouse has one flaw which would be the feature of the scoll wheel
997	pos	It was creative but this mouse has a feature which makes it very loose and makes the scroll wheel go on for mutiple lines and i know theres an option for that but when you press the button on the bottom of the scroll wheel to make the scroll wheel go stiff and maybe a little to stiff for my personal liking Other than that this gaming mouse is the best you could find at this price
998	pos	Its a great mouse for gaming or viewing large documents
998	pos	The scroll release is practical for large documents, I jave not been able to get use to it during gaming
999	pos	First off the mouse is pretty damn cool
999	pos	It fits perfectly in the palm of my hand
999	pos	It comes with weights for better traction and precision
999	pos	The only thing I noticed was the left clicker feels as though it could break easly break, so I'll take extra care of it
999	pos	Overall a great buy for the price
1000	pos	As someone who is new to OC gaming, this mouse is perfect
1000	pos	The buttons allow for a wide variety of button mapping and are in comfortable positions
1000	pos	The weights just are the icing on the cake
1000	pos	The wire also is slack so it doesn't get in the way
1000	pos	Love the sounds of the buttons and the overall feel of the mouse
1000	pos	Very good purchase
1001	pos	Good:- Works perfect on mac and PC- Excellent Logitech software- Feels nice in your hands (even for people with big hands like me)- So many buttons
1001	pos	all customizable
1001	pos	- Looks awesomeBad:- Not a deal breaker, but I do wish it rested a little bit higher so it would go into your palm
1002	pos	I dont care about all the bells and whistles, just tired of buying cheap mice that crap out after a year and this is still working
1003	pos	Maybe I was expecting more, but too many buttons in just the wrong place for my large thumbs
1003	pos	Just not for me
1004	pos	I've had this game mouse for over a year and it has work really well, I am still happy with it and it has work well for the most part
1004	pos	Just for context I use it everyday and well so far it has been a great product, and my favorite gaming mouse
1004	pos	10/10 in aesthetics indeed, it gives me futuristic vibes
1005	pos	Comfortable for both gaming and working from home, too
1005	pos	Is a good size (fits the shape/curve of my right hand nicely) and comes with weights to adjust to your comfort
1005	pos	I've had no issues so far
1005	pos	I bought this after my long-time favorite mouse broke (a pretty old discontinued Logitech Performance MX Wireless mouse) and am happy with this choice of replacement
1005	pos	I am hoping this one will last as long as my previous Logitech mouse
1006	pos	The additional weights were a plus, otherwise the mouse is too light IMO
1006	pos	The mouse wheel felt clunky and the position required me to use my index verses middle finger
1006	pos	The angle of the mouse was too flat, I would have preferred the left side to be about
1006	pos	5 inch higher than the right
1006	pos	The mouse shell is too flat for my hands
1006	pos	I may pass this off to one of my grandkids as it would fit their hands better or keep it for a spare
1007	pos	The mouse is great, its has a nice quality feel, the RGB is nice, and the sensor is amazing but on my mouse there was a personal issue with the mouse skate
1007	pos	When I first slid it on my mouse pad it started to scratch it and it didn't have a smooth glide
1007	pos	So I turned the mouse around and noticed the mouse skate was not positioned right on the bottom, so I tried repositioning it but then the mouse skate wouldn't stick back on to the mouse
1007	pos	That is the only main issue with my personal mouse but everything else is great
1008	neg	Dowloaded the app and unchecked roughly 17 boxes to stop the giant glowing logo on the mouse, but as soon as I close my PC the thing lights up my room like the fourth of July
1008	neg	Not sure why it's so important to have the giant glowing logo, but this mouse sells itself on customizability and won't even let you turn off this feature
1009	pos	This new version comes with color changing lights and the range of adjustibility for sensitivity is much bigger, all else is nearly identical to previous versions
1010	neg	I bought this device Apr 17, 2020 and by Sep 1, 2020
1010	neg	Five months later my right mouse button has begun dying
1010	neg	I don't think Logitech is at fault because I've owned other models and they lasted years but I will not replace this mouse with the same model
1010	neg	It would have got one star but it has been very comfortable and worked well until it didn't
1011	neg	Mouse worked great for a while
1011	neg	After 6 months mouse now double clicks on single clicks and also won't stay depressed
1011	neg	Extremely frustrating
1011	neg	Logitech very slow to respond
1011	neg	Known issue
1012	neg	I tried ordering two of these wired mice (SE and regular) to have both already been opened and used as they were missing protective stickers on the pads
1012	neg	The first box was opened and had items out of place and jammed back in
1012	neg	Second one did not have any plastic film and there is wear on the friction pads and fingerprints even before I handled it
1012	neg	The buttons are good and mouse is a little small for larger hands
1012	neg	G-Hub is great
1012	neg	Fingerprint resistance would be nice since I was able to see the person's who handled my mouse prior
1013	pos	The sensitivity and ergonomics on this mouse are great
1013	pos	The number of buttons is significant and are arranged in an manner that is not intrusive
1013	pos	I have minor concerns about the quality
1013	pos	The "G" light stopped working (which I determined to be a hardware issue) and the cover for the weights comes off quite easily
1014	pos	very smooth, operation
1014	pos	Worked immediately as soon as I plugged it into my PC
1014	pos	Feels plasticy, but its a $40 mouse
1014	pos	Working great so far
1015	neg	the left button started to get stuck sometimes while using it
1016	neg	I've had this mouse for 7+ months
1016	neg	Starting at around 5 months of use, the left and right mouse buttons started giving me issues
1016	neg	I cannot click and drag without the button registering multiple clicks
1016	neg	This makes it especially difficult during FPS games because trying to aim down the sights and look around results in an irritating and game-ruining "aim down sights dance"
1016	neg	Logitech's customer support has proven to be terrible and unresponsive
1016	neg	Even though I love this mouse, I will probably be trying out a Razer Death Adder because I can't rely on this mouse to work properly
1017	neg	Buyer beware if you use a mouse in free scroll mode, stay away
1017	neg	The mouse wheel is unbalanced and will scroll on its own depending on the direction you move the wheel
1017	neg	mouse is great otherwise, in fixed mode the mouse "bumps" are very pronounced and loud
1017	neg	The mouse has potential however the mouse wheel is something left to be desired
1018	pos	I had been using the GSkill mouse but they are all out, so I went and bought this, I am glad I did, the software is far far superior and easier on resources
1018	pos	Very fun mouse to use
1019	neg	Great mouse overall
1019	neg	I absolutely loved the scroll wheel lock and the thumb rest for I have big hands
1019	neg	A couple months after I bought both left and right click started to double click, not register clicks, and have delayed clicks
1019	neg	I’d find it okay if just mine did this, but as I bought the mouse, I recommended it to 2 of my friends
1019	neg	Sure enough, within two months of them using it, the EXACT same thing happened to their unit
1019	neg	If you’re an avid gamer, please heed my warning and DO NOT BUY THIS
1020	pos	Wasn't a great fit for my hand
1020	pos	I have very large hands and this mouse is quite narrow with almost no hump for palm grip
1020	pos	The very solid mouse wheel also makes it a bit forward balanced which was hard to get used to
1021	neg	Left mouse button wore out after a month, multiple clicks after every click
1021	neg	Still working with logitech for warranty replacement but I'm not happy
1021	neg	I'm writing this review to prevent others from making my mistake, this is hardware issue that has caused me many headaches
1022	pos	I LOVE this mouse it is great for gaming
1022	pos	First: It has RGB like if you don't have RGB on your mouse WHAT ARE YOU DOING
1022	pos	Two: Very good feel
1022	pos	This mouse has a very amazing feel that fits perfectly with your hand
1022	pos	It also has a thumb rest
1022	pos	Three: Program
1022	pos	this mouse comes with a program that is called Logitech G Hub you can change your DPI with your programable buttons and even create personalized DPI settings and you can lower the brightness of your mouse light and make the lights go by faster
1023	neg	Shortest lived mouse I've owned
1023	neg	Accurate
1023	neg	Sure
1023	neg	Comfortable, size wise
1023	neg	Sure
1023	neg	Comfortable, weight wise
1023	neg	A little light but fine
1023	neg	The big issue: just under four months of use and the left mouse started malfunctioning
1024	pos	The USB connector was weak and after treating this mouse like a baby never letting it take damage what eventually broke wasn’t the mouse but the USB connector
1024	pos	It didn’t register as a mouse on my device anymore nor any other devices
1024	pos	The software (GHub) out of all companies is pretty good though and the grip and ergonomics of that mouse was the best I’ve ever had
1024	pos	If i wasn’t so paranoid about the weak USB connector I would’ve gotten it again
1025	pos	This is a fantastic mouse
1025	pos	The price is reasonable
1025	pos	It comes with weights to adjust the mass of the mouse to your liking
1025	pos	This provides a great ergonomic feel with with flow of the mouse it's natural in the hand
1025	pos	The adjustable dip setting is nice for swit hing between different game types which make this great for gaming
1025	pos	The overall construction of the mous is really nice
1026	pos	As a dota and CS player, it is very critical to get a good mouse and this one is one of the top choices in thee market
1026	pos	The best part of it is the ergonomic desigh, which makes your hand feels like a breeze when playing games
1027	pos	I upgraded from a razor black adder and I wasn’t expecting such an improvement
1027	pos	Moving from a palm mouse to a finger mouse has really helped my aiming/flicks in RB6 and apex
1027	pos	The weights that come with it allow you to adjust the weight to your preference
1027	pos	The DPi range also allows you to find a setting that fits you
1027	pos	Overall construction of the mouse is solid and I haven’t had any issues with it so far
1027	pos	Software is good and allows you to change the DPI and custom map buttons
1028	pos	Compré este mouse porqué mis amigos me decían que un mouse de alta gama me haría jugar mejor, la verdad es que si y no, la verdad se siente un cambio abismal, de un mouse gamer genérico a un mouse de gama alta absolutamente te va a cambiar todo el DPI y te llevará semanas a acostumbrarte y cambiar a nuevas sensibilidades en los juegos, todavía sigo buscando configuraciones pero no me arrepiento de la compra, excelente mouse
1029	pos	LOVE this mouse, but it's a little narrow (Hand cramping after long sessions), and HORRIBLE thumb button
1029	pos	The cramping is all me -- I am just a fat handed moronic gamer
1029	pos	The Thumb button is so close to the edge of your thumb you will find yourself pressing by accident in heated FPS battles and wow sessions
1029	pos	Other than the listed above gripes, this mouse is legend
1029	pos	I LOVE Logitech
1030	pos	I made a switch to logitech G series coming from Razer and right from the start I can feel a better sense of quality
1030	pos	I love razer and used their projects for the majority of my PC life, but this mouse surely delivers
1030	pos	I can go on about the specs that are already posted on the listing, but this mouse is a definite 10/10
1031	pos	Very comfortable
1031	pos	Has 5 extra buttons which are great to program as Alt + and Ctrl + buttons
1031	pos	Fits hand comfortably, able to adjust the weight of it and can run multiple settings for speed with a touch of a button
1031	pos	Feels better in my hand than a Naga mouse
1031	pos	I own two, one for my laptop and one for my desktop
1032	neg	Doesn't track properly on all mousepads, I have to rely on the wood grain of my desk
1032	neg	Never had this issue with another mouse
1032	neg	Updating to remove another star
1032	neg	Mouse tracker is absolutely awful
1032	neg	I shouldn't have to keep buying and trying out different options to get the mouse to stop jumping around
1032	neg	I wound up having to tape a sheet of paper to a mousepad, which apart from being an eyesore, tears and has very high friction
1032	neg	Don't understand how Logitech gets away with this
1033	neg	At first I thought it might have been because someone might have spilt something on the mouse
1033	neg	But after cleaning the button itself and the switches, its still sticking (not to mention it looked spotless inside)
1033	neg	I bought this back in October and its already broken
1034	pos	I was so hesitant to upgrade from my Logitech G9X, but this mouse feels almost exactly the same
1034	pos	Finger tip grip
1034	pos	Larger hands (6' 2" user)Cons:I hate the fact that the software always has to run
1034	pos	If you do not want more bloatware, then avoid this mouse
1035	pos	I like the overall feel of the mouse
1035	pos	Some of the button positions could be in a better place, but I have large hands so someone with average hands shouldn't have this problem
1036	pos	So I had to do a lot of repetitive entries, and I just programmed the buttons
1036	pos	Easy as pie
1036	pos	This is maki g the dull tasks fun and super easy
1036	pos	No more typing
1036	pos	Awesome mouse, love it
1036	pos	Sorry
1036	pos	I’m not a gamer, so I can’t get you that feedback, but it’s fully programmable with selective profiles, very flexible
1037	pos	Works great love the new software, this replaced my beloved g700s whose switches are starting to go :(I am very happy with
1038	pos	I loved how everything worked but the instructions didn't give much info about which programs you need to download, you need to get a separate on board memory programer on their website but it's amazing for gaming and has more features then expected
1038	pos	Would recommend
1039	neg	My old G500S gave out after many years of use ( the left click got to where it would release constantly making it impossible to click-hold/drag)
1039	neg	So I bought a this G502 and just a few weeks after the return window  closed the left button started doing the same thing , it just randomly releases and grabs and releases and grabs
1039	neg	rendering the mouse useless
1040	neg	I have an older G502 (not hero) mouse and thought the 502 Hero would be a great mouse to have at work for consistency
1040	neg	However this mouse out of the box was broken
1040	neg	I tried it on multiple computers and the cursor randomly jumps around the screen making it hard to click on anything
1040	neg	I tried resetting default settings and nothing works
1040	neg	I would advise against getting this mouse
1040	neg	What is the point of having it if you can't use it to click on items on your monitors, guess this is going in the trash
1041	pos	Been using it about 3 months and it’s been great so far
1041	pos	I’ve been using it for light work but will be gaming with it here in the next few days
1041	pos	And will update the review but so far I haven’t had any problems and it always works when it’s supposed to
1041	pos	I hear of others having double click problems but I havent had that(yet)
1042	pos	Cannot use this mouse on a cloth mouse pad
1042	pos	It just won't work
1042	pos	I thought the mouse was defective until I tried a hard black surface
1042	pos	The corsair mouse pad
1042	pos	Worked well after that
1042	pos	Software isn't very smart
1042	pos	Not very intuitive and works most of the time
1043	pos	This is my second mouse
1043	pos	The smooth bottom, the adjustable weights, and the multiple dpi profiles makes this mouse perfect for just about anyone
1043	pos	Love it
1044	pos	My first one hasn't broken and it's been a couple of years
1044	pos	Saw it on sale for cyber monday and bought another, just in case
1044	pos	It's that good
1044	pos	Bit of a pain to clean, but besides that it's perfect
1045	pos	Let me start by saying that this mouse is great as far as performance goes
1045	pos	It’s definitely one of my favorite mice to use for FPS
1045	pos	I’ve been using it for a good 5 months now and I’m happy with it
1045	pos	Now I will say that the feel of the mouse is good, but my hands are a bit on the smaller size and it took me a while to get used to
1045	pos	As far as comfort, I’d put this 2nd behind my G403 prodigy (I love that mouse with all my heart) but I needed a replacement and this lived up to most of my expectations
1046	neg	Needs replaced after 6 months of use
1047	pos	After reading other reviews, first thing I did was swapped out the switches
1047	pos	Since I'm bad at removing solder, it took me like 3 hours to get it done
1048	neg	One of the bottom pads began to peel off from normal use and routinely causes my mouse to stick
1048	neg	I use a good quality mousepad too so there should be no reason for this to have happened
1049	pos	Amazing quality made, works amazing for the gamer, perfect response time
1049	pos	finally a mouse without lagging
1049	pos	Very easy to use, an great for all hand sizes
1050	neg	Worked very well for me for a few months, then doubleclick issues started, didn't notice at first but the longer i owned it the worse it became, no doubt within a few months of use you will most likely start experiencing issues as well, i've owned a cheap reddragon mouse for years with no issues, and i was very happy with my purchase at first but mice should definitely be usable for years with no issues
1050	neg	Do not buy unless u want to replace it within a year
1051	pos	I did some research before choosing this product
1051	pos	It's a claw-shaped mouse with everything I really want
1051	pos	It's somewhat narrow for a claw mouse, but it has a comfortable arch
1051	pos	The buttons feel good so far
1051	pos	The scroll wheel is horrible
1051	pos	It free spins
1051	pos	It will even spin if I pick up the mouse
1051	pos	I've actually had to go to individual applications to change my settings to dampen the impact
1051	pos	It's not enough for me to warrant returning it and choosing a different product, but it's really horrible
1052	neg	Garbage
1052	neg	We tried to be patient and understanding, so we returned it and tried again
1052	neg	We're on our 3rd one now and the left click, once again, stopped working consistently
1052	neg	Not good if your using it for gaming
1052	neg	Of course this time it was one week out of the return window
1052	neg	:-/
1053	pos	I have had many Logitech mouses over the years and this one doesn't disappoint
1053	pos	It has held up very well and this is my second time buying it
1054	pos	This mouse is HUGELY worth getting especially for it's price
1054	pos	I don't personally use the extra buttons but I use them for skipping/stopping/resuming songs and with the driver its great for rgb control and it's very durable you can use the weights if you want and its great for gaming no jitter no nothing
1055	neg	This mouse worked great, unfortunately after just under a year the middle scroll button is faulty
1055	neg	It will constantly act like it's being held down, even though it's not, causing me to endlessly scroll on pages when I'm not wanting to
1055	neg	It surprisingly makes using the computer rather difficult and annoying
1055	neg	I have to click the middle scroll button just to unstick it
1056	neg	The switches on these mice are faulty and only work for a little while
1056	neg	For an 80 dollar mouse, I'd expect more than ten cent switches that render the mouse useless
1056	neg	It's a shame, too, because I love this mouse and especially its relatively unique free-scroll feature, the thought of which upsets me because I know I'll have to get used to a different mouse
1056	neg	If I didn't have to choose between spending another 80 bucks or becoming an electrician to solve this issue, I'd give this mouse 5 stars
1057	pos	This mouse has an issue with connecting to the Logitech Gaming Software
1057	pos	No matter how many times I reinstall the software, restart my computer or change the usb slot the mouse is plugged into, it still won’t show up in the menu continuously
1057	pos	Reinstalling the software works until I power the computer off and then back on; it immediately doesn’t show then, and I have to reinstall it all over again
1058	pos	Currently my mouse for everything cord is plenty long to never get in the way and always have enough came with weights if you like the feel of a heavier mouse and has an awesome dpi setting that is perfect
1059	pos	I replaced my G700s with this mouse, they stopped selling the G700
1059	pos	Had issues with the speed buttons until I disabled them and now the left main button is intermittent, 7 months
1060	pos	Really great polling rate, so very responsive
1060	pos	Slight annoyance when you're moving the mouse and the DPI randomly changes (for whatever reason, maybe I'm clicking the DPI button, maybe it's internal/mouse driver), but it's very annoying
1060	pos	Mouse itself feels solidly built, and you can change the weights fairly easily
1061	pos	I love this mouse
1061	pos	The weight is customizable and it moves so smoothly
1061	pos	The scroll wheel can free spin or be controlled at the press of a button
1061	pos	10/10
1062	neg	Logitech quality control has gone downhill lately
1062	neg	The scroll wheel broke when the mouse fell from my desk onto a carpeted floor, a 2' drop
1063	pos	Used daily for a year, gaming and work
1063	pos	Works great
1063	pos	Im used to logitechs  occasionally  buggy software and it isn't that bad really
1063	pos	Works on xbox and pc no problem
1063	pos	Set up dpi on pc, move to xbox and it keeps
1063	pos	Both came in good clean packaging
1063	pos	Will update if any issues
1064	neg	Upgraded from an MX510 I purchased in 2004
1064	neg	Yes, 2004
1064	neg	Pros: Great interface/software for colors and profiles
1064	neg	Very user-friendly
1064	neg	Cons: After 8 months of use, the Left Mouse Clicker registers 75% of the time
1064	neg	This is crucial when gaming
1064	neg	I switched back to my trusty MX510 until I find a replacement
1064	neg	Back on the hunt
1064	neg	I've wasted my money, these Logitech mice are not built like high end models
1065	pos	Cat says it's great and it's the best one it used in his life
1065	pos	Cat is me dad btw XD
1066	pos	They come with custom weight, but I don't use them
1066	pos	I prefer as little weight as possible for fastest swipes
1067	pos	As a console player transitioning to pc gaming this mouse really helped
1067	pos	Struggling with the left hand and WASD movement made any other commands with that hand even more difficult
1067	pos	I have the mouse setup for pretty well every command needed in FPS games except movement
1067	pos	The buttons are well placed and smooth/consistent to operate
1067	pos	Highly recommend this product
1068	pos	This is probably THE BEST gaming mouse for people with a budget
1068	pos	The fast response time is amazing and it feels great
1068	pos	I’ve been using it for some time and it’s probably one of the best mice that I’ve used, idk why I haven’t bought it sooner
1068	pos	It’s a little bit bigger and slightly heavier than normal
1068	pos	But it’ll be quite easy to get used to
1068	pos	10/10 recommend this mouse to other gamers
1069	pos	I had to replace my wireless one due to my buttons being so sensitive no matter how I changed the settings
1069	pos	It is a big rascal which suits me well and my bear paw hands
1070	neg	I don't think I'll ever buy another Logitech mouse ever again
1070	neg	Double-click issue makes it a hassle to do anything, whether it's holding down a mouse button while gaming or trying to highlight part of a document
1070	neg	From what I've heard, they use the trash-quality omron Chinese switches that are prone to this issue
1071	pos	Very comfortable mouse, fitd my hand well
1071	pos	I did not need to use the weights
1071	pos	The mouse is Smooth and very easy to setup
1071	pos	I would recommend is mouse for gaming or computer use
1072	pos	I'm not a fan of RGB unicorn puke builds but I made an exception with this mouse
1072	pos	I was just thinking to myself how nice it is to have different RGB color schemes that indicate certain gaming profiles
1073	pos	I like a heavy mouse with a thumb rest…with 26000dpi this thing even at it’s heaviest is plenty fast for FPS Esports
1073	pos	If you like a beefier mouse for larger hands this is definitely a great option for a fantastic price
1074	pos	Really good for the discounted price
1074	pos	I personally prefer to use the weights, though I know the current trend is to go light
1074	pos	The scroll wheel is cool and effective with it's ability to spin freely if given a flick
1075	neg	The mouse sensor is probably the only good thing here
1075	neg	Each time you do a swift flick or movement, you can hear this noise since the scroll wheel is highly sensitive
1075	neg	The scroll wheel is okay, dont know why they added that infinite scroll mechanic but its okay for the most part
1075	neg	Since I have sausage fingers, I keep hitting the side button, which is highly annoying
1075	neg	The shape of it is meh
1075	neg	Overall, meh
1076	pos	I wish I would have purchased one of these sooner
1076	pos	Definitely an upgrade to the old laser mouse I had which was top of the line back in the day
1076	pos	I'm impressed by it's accuracy
1077	pos	Decent mouse but the buttons are a bit flimsy, left click started double clicking after only a month or so
1077	pos	Set it aside and forgot to return it
1077	pos	Hopefully I can still RMA it
1077	pos	Consider other similar mice with better button design before opting for this one
1077	pos	Disappointing, Logitech used to be the go-to mice for me
1077	pos	One G9 sensor died after 24 hours, the replacement wasn't smooth and failed 6 months later
1077	pos	Then the issue with this mouse
1077	pos	Don't think I'll be buying from them again any time soon
1078	neg	Great mouse for chill gaming, lightweight with optional weights to adjust
1078	neg	One issue that unfortunately makes this mouse impossible to play competitive games reliably is holding the right click button will "disconnect" intermittently
1078	neg	Imagine playing COD or Counterstrike and the screen wont "turn"
1078	neg	UGH
1078	neg	I've attached an image to help illustrate this issue (MS Paint, right button)
1078	neg	Circled are the instances where the mouse doesn't register being "clicked"
1078	neg	Wish I could try again same model, maybe I just got a bum mouse
1079	neg	I looked up the issue of double clicking for this mouse
1079	neg	While it's nice while it works, the damn thing has a lifetime of about 3 months at most before it becomes unusable
1079	neg	Logitech should be ashamed to sell something so defective
1080	pos	Best peice to my gaming setup
1080	pos	This mouse has plenty of hotkeys and very customizable led
1080	pos	Plus it has weights for a feel that you really want
1080	pos	When they say this is the number one gaming mouse they mean it
1081	pos	so far so good, tracks well, handles ok
1081	pos	Unbound the "sniper" thumb button because It gets pressed occasionally when I claw grip
1081	pos	Mouse doesn't creak when I grip it which is nice but I think I've caught the scroll wheel misfiring or double inputting on occasion
1082	pos	I did not like the scroll wheel, it feels slippery
1082	pos	I don't know if this is a defective mouse
1082	pos	I'm returning it
1083	pos	I have big hands and this one feels good
1083	pos	I wish it was a bit bigger but this is one of the bigger gaming mice on the market
1083	pos	I haven’t experienced the double click issue at the time of this review but I’ve owned for for only a month so we will see
1084	pos	This product is great, but there are simply better options
1084	pos	The materials seem very nice, but when you hold the mouse itself, the materials just feel clunky
1084	pos	Even without all the included weights, it is still weighs in at around 100 grams
1084	pos	In addition, I also prefer wireless mice for the reason of convenience
1084	pos	My computer's USB port is kind of strange and doesn't always work, so Bluetooth was the way to go
1084	pos	Overall a ⭐⭐⭐
1085	pos	I bought this to be my main mouse
1085	pos	It is very adjustable in both weight, colors, and sensitivity
1085	pos	I've yet to see the double right click issue
1085	pos	I like that you can make your own profiles for whatever you need it
1085	pos	I've made my thumb buttons adjust volume and my mouse wheel side buttons set to forward and back on a page
1085	pos	The unlocked scroll wheel changed my life
1085	pos	While the mouse is adjustable for weight, the base weight may be too high for some people but I have no issue with it
1086	pos	Bought this as a gift for my brother, I’ve had my own Hero mouse for around 2 years
1086	pos	Best investment I’ve made
1086	pos	I’ve had ZERO problems with this mouse
1086	pos	I game on my pc and this thing is a beast
1086	pos	My only regret is not putting down the extra money for the wireless feature
1086	pos	Nothing wrong at all with the wired version but I’d like to try out that wireless mouse considering how nice this one is
1087	pos	I had been using razer peripherals for a while but I prefer this Logitech mouse
1087	pos	It does t have as many buttons as some other mice but the dpi switch actually works, and I think you can retool the incremental dpi buttons to perform other actions
1087	pos	Weights are nice, very simple to implement
1087	pos	I never thought I’d need or like the option to freewheel the mouse wheel but it’s actually one of my favorite features, now

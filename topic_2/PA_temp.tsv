0	pos	There's a button that locks and unlocks the scroll wheel
1	neg	The first one I had for a very short time
1	neg	During that time I was doing a lot of gaming/designing and the click issue showed up very quickly
1	neg	During the time I had the new one, I was not doing as much gaming/designing so the click issue took longer to show up
1	neg	I am convinced this is a design flaw in the mouse itself
1	neg	I will not purchase another one of these
1	neg	The price is not worth it at all with the click issue
1	neg	To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or double clicks
1	neg	However, this creates a lot of issues with gaming, graphic design and so much more when trying to work and renders the mouse almost useless because of productivity
2	neg	It seems logitech has either a quality control problem or a supply problem because the switches in these mice are absolute garbage
2	neg	Less than a year old and $75 gets you a mouse that feels great in the hand until the scroll wheel starts jumping around and the left click starts randomly double clicking, and then not clicking at all - all intermittently
2	neg	I will not be going any of these routes and I'm sad to say it because Logitech used to be a staple in PC peripherals
2	neg	Now it's not the plastic it's made of
2	neg	edit: As I write this update, I have actually taken another star off for the true, 1 star review
2	neg	I typically don't believe in one star reviews because it's generally an overreaction and everything is either 5 stars great or 1 star horrible, but Logitech has sunken to the 1 star territory
2	neg	I will never buy a logitech product again
2	neg	Do yourself a favor and google 'logitech double click' and question whether you want to buy this mouse, likely have the issue, and then not have the warranty honored
2	neg	I bought a cheap mouse replacement to tide me over and it works much better anyway
3	pos	The Logitech g502 was always a quality mouse and tons of people love the thing just based on the design and overall quality of the mouse

3	pos	The Pros of this mouse are fairly straightforward, and are as follows:- Comfortable shape for most right handed people, but should be more comfortable for people with medium to large size hands
3	pos	- Good build quality which easily places it in the same category as other 'premium' around this price point or even a bit higher
3	pos	-  Scroll wheel: this is one of my personal favorite features of the mouse
3	pos	Allows infinite scroll to get through annoying EULA pages quicker and also quickly raise or lower volume on YouTube or other video streaming sites, but without sacrificing the much needed precision of the standard mouse wheel steps
3	pos	Feels satisfying to use
3	pos	- Sensor: The Logitech Hero sensor has been tested numerous times and found to be roughly on par with the PMW3360 series sensors (including the 3366 on the original g502) while being advantageous for usage in wireless mice due to the lessened draw of power which allows for a longer battery life
3	neg	The Cons of this mouse make it hard to recommend to everyone, and are why I don't usually recommend it as a first choice
3	neg	This thing is one of the heaviest mice I've used for an extended period of time
3	neg	- Not a truly "safe" shape, this may or may not matter to you, but I felt that it's worth mentioning
4	neg	Scroll wheel broke within the first week and now it freewheels like fidget spinner
5	pos	the laser and accuracy is the best ive touched ever
5	neg	i frequently hit extra buttons on the mouse and the thumb button makes me hold the entire mouse in a uncomfortable way
5	pos	in summation  if you are hard core about fps's this is the mouse you need, want and have to have
6	pos	So when I learned they are refreshing the 502 with a new sensor I was skeptical to pay $30 more for the new one
6	pos	Now that I used it I am glad I did
6	pos	The refreshed model has a really thick and flexible cord that was apparently a major weakness in the original 502
6	pos	Couple that with a really awesome sensor that is super accurate and sensitive to slightest movements and tracks on any surface (seriously I tried everything from a white paper to the palm of my hand) and you have a potential winner
6	pos	However, the best part of this mouse is not that or the the materials that they used which also feels really nice and durable
6	pos	While subjective and relevant to how big or small your hands are for me the way the mouse sits in my hand and how easy it is to access the buttons are the best indicators
6	pos	The buttons themselves feel very satisfying to press thanks to the spring loaded mechanism
6	pos	this scrollwheel I can probably write a whole paragraph on how good it is
6	pos	Not only does it have the infinite mode that rolls beautifully but also its made from METAL
6	pos	Its a nice chunk of metal that is just better than a plastic one in every way
6	pos	I dont think I can go back to plastic mouse-wheels after using my G502
6	pos	You might never use the 16000DPI sensor but if you used G502 and similar mice in the past and are due for an upgrade the refresh 502 is totally worth the money Logitech is asking for
7	neg	) Improved braided cable over previous G502 model
7	pos	) The weight options are exact same as previous model
7	pos	(Feels identical in all ways, easy to get used to
7	pos	fits my hand fairly well
7	pos	) DPI shift button is epic for sniping btw
7	pos	(Great for nudging objects in Adobe too
7	pos	) LIGHTSYNC added to this model is cool for custom rigs & lighting
7	pos	(Single click, easy to enable
7	pos	) Fully customizable RGB LED, you can set color, cycle speed & mode indicators
7	pos	) VERY VERY accurate mouse, 4,000 DPI higher than previous 12,000 DPI 502 model
7	pos	16,000 DPI is insane resolution tbh
7	pos	) Rubberized areas can handle greasy, salty gamer hands lol
7	pos	they are the most durable grips I have ever seen in my 30 years of using mice
7	neg	LEFT MOUSE BUTTON FAILURE
7	neg	Logitech products across the board are having durability issues
7	neg	((Possibly they are too trick for their own good)1
7	neg	) The cord is much better, but this mouse still has one
7	pos	(It's hard to find CONS with the G502 HERO
7	pos	) Really miss the cordless days, but this mouse catches every signal & the slightest movements
7	neg	) The RGB is usually not prominent as it's under your hand or in sleep mode
7	neg	) Free wheel mouse mode can be sensitive to twitch gaming
7	neg	Some rolling can occur, but you gotta be really shaking it
7	neg	I need to be highly accurate in my video, photography & gaming life, all the G502 series mice have enhanced my computer work & play
7	pos	they still work perfectly and remain accurate
7	pos	Seriously this mouse brought my K/D up to new highs, it's so much better than the $100 cordless laser I'm still kind of in shock
7	pos	Using this for websites, photo editing & detail alignments in Adobe is a dream come true
7	pos	DON'T FORGET IT's EVEN GOT MACROS
7	pos	I don't use them to their full potential, but the few macros I have are awesome
7	pos	FINAL NOTE: My first G502 is still rock solid even after years of abuse, nothing has failed
7	pos	Mouse wheel is 100% & so is the weight latch
7	neg	I hated Logitech until I used the 502's, their mousewheels fail, wireless signal loss is constant (with exception to the $100 wireless lasers
7	neg	I was pissed off at Logitech when I bought the 502 & was ready to rip apart this mouse in a review if it SUCKED
8	neg	they get the infamous double click issue
8	pos	The good:- It is a nice looking mouse from outside
8	neg	The bad:- Right out of the box, this mouse started randomly double clicking or needed to click multiple times for it to react
8	neg	- On free-wheel mode, it just scrolls with the movement of the mouse, even if the wheel is not moving at all
8	neg	- Not at all ergonomic, it will hurt your hand after 10 minutes using it
8	neg	The back is too narrow, no support for the right side of your hand, and to hold it properly you have to close your hand in an awkward way
8	neg	- Both options of the software to program/change settings are unnecessarily intrusive on your computer, and every 30 minutes or so, make it go sluggish with the mouse barely responding
8	neg	If you remove the software the default settings for the buttons are useless
8	neg	I have been a loyal Logitech buyer for over 20 years, but the quality of their products has been on a free fall for a while now, and this is the last product I buy from them
8	neg	The quality of the product no longer justifies the price
9	pos	I really wanted to love this mouse
9	neg	This style of form factor, with a nice little ledge for your thumb to rest on, doesn't get enough love from mouse OEMs
9	pos	Finally, I really liked that the mouse is WIRED
9	pos	The new hero sensor is also awesome
9	neg	Sadly, I am out of denial and into grief
9	neg	The main issue with this mouse is the scroll wheel
9	neg	It just sucks
9	neg	And then it's hard to know when you've successfully clicked the scroll wheel down, because it requires so much actuation force and yet has so little travel
9	neg	The tactility feels all wrong--both too abrupt/tactile and not sticky enough for something that is so abrupt/tactile
9	neg	At the same time, the scroll wheel actually rattles because of the force of the increments--but only like maybe half the time
9	neg	The combination of these features induces an overall sensation of unpredictability and randomness along with an unpleasant sound
9	neg	A less critical but still painful flaw is the button placement
9	neg	The idea of a little ledge sticking out is to use a palm grip and rest your thumb there, right
9	neg	However, doing so places one of the other two main side buttons totally out of reach
9	neg	You have bend your thumb back so hard to reach back button that it basically means only a claw grip is truly comfortable--in which case the thumb ledge goes unused
9	neg	So, all in all, yeah I think Logitech should go back to the drawing board and generate this style of mouse with different button placement and a much more nicely tuned scroll wheel
10	neg	I really expected so much more out of Logitech and incredibly upset that in less then a month the mouse is already giving me issues
10	neg	The weights were pretty nice and helped in a way, but what makes me give this mouse a 1 rating is the right click problem that so many people complained about
10	neg	It happened so frequently that I can't even play the game properly
10	neg	The double clicking is truly a problem and I decided to risk purchasing this mouse even after seeing so many complain about it in the reviews
10	neg	Shame on you Logitech :(
11	pos	Loved this mouse for 3 months, absolutely everything
11	neg	This escalates and quickly becomes to 1 in every 10 clicks just a month after you notice the first double click issue starting
11	neg	I took the time to write the review now because after 4 months with my right click double clicking every 1 out of 10 clicks the left mouse button has started the 1 out of 1,000
11	neg	My fear is that in another month I'll have the same issue with the left click
11	neg	This mouse is already un-usable for gaming as any fps with scopes become unplayable as you cannot reliably ADS or hold scopes in fear that it will double click and make you lose ADS or lose your scope
12	pos	This was a really great mouse prior to it developing a double left click issue under a year of use
12	neg	I did some digging online and found that this seems to be due to their mouse switches
12	neg	Looks like I'm going back to Razer as the tables have turned now
12	neg	Fix your products Logitech
12	pos	I'm just glad I still have my older G502 Proteus Core and Proteus Spectrum mice to fall back on for the time being as those had switches that don't seem to have the issue
12	neg	It's not worth my time and or money of sending this back and forth
13	pos	I was a big fan of Logitech, all the mice that I have purchased for all my computers since the 1990's have been either Logitech (95%) or Razer (5%) and ive had over 20 mice over the years
13	pos	I dont mistreat my mice, the reason that I usually end up replacing mice is because a newer one comes out with more buttons or features and I replace my current mouse
13	neg	The left mouse button will also start experiencing issues where it starts to click more than the times that you actually clicked, 1 click will register as 2-3 clicks and double clicking will register as if you clicked 4+ times
13	neg	29 Logitech G502 Hero, at least if the Asus mouse starts having the same issue at a year or less I only spent $20 on it
14	neg	But this mouse, even when it's working, is just above average for a gaming mouse IMO
14	neg	It has high DPI settings which is nice, but mostly useless because not many people even get close to touching those settings
14	neg	They're far too sensitive for the vast majority of people
14	neg	The main problem with this mouse is quality
14	neg	It'll last you between 6 months and a year before the left click stops working properly
14	neg	There have been issues with left click problems for YEARS on Logitech mice, and it doesn't seem like they've done anything to try to fix the problem
14	neg	When you click, it double clicks
14	neg	It's very frustrating and annoying
14	pos	It worked great at first, so I decided to get me one too
14	neg	Mine lasted until the RMA period was over, and then the left click stopped working
14	neg	Not the typical double click problem though
14	neg	Mine can't register a click+hold for long
14	neg	Drag it half way and it'll suddenly let go of the tab and create a new browser window out of the tab
14	neg	It'll probably let go of the mail and drop it in the wrong folder, etc
14	neg	It won't work
14	neg	At this point, my daughters mouse was still working, so I thought maybe I just got a defective mouse
14	neg	It hasn't even been 6 months and it already has the same exact problem
14	neg	All 4 of our Logitech mice, similar make and model, have all had problems with the left click
14	neg	All of them purchased from different places over 2+ years of time
14	neg	The problems I'm having aren't just a fluke
14	neg	They're not a result of getting a unlucky bad mouse
14	neg	There's a very good chance if you buy this mouse, you'll have similar problems within a year, even with light use
14	neg	As a gaming mouse, this thing should be able to stand up to abuse, but it'll break even with light use
14	neg	That makes it a BAD gaming mouse, and a bad mouse in general
14	neg	Even writing this review, I tried to highlight some text to copy/paste it to another section, and I can't even do that
14	neg	I had to hold shift+arrow keys to highlight the text because my mouse will just delete it or move it to some random places while I'm still holding left click/dragging
14	neg	It's not comfortable at all unless you have fairly small hands
14	neg	Don't buy this mouse
14	neg	There's 10-20 other gaming mice out there that are just as good, and better quality
15	pos	From the standpoint of how this mouse feels, it is amazing
15	pos	In the short period of time it actually works it is wonderful
15	neg	Having said that, from a quality aspect it is a pile of flaming trash
15	neg	Both have the exact same problem where the left mouse button starts double-clicking for any presses after about 3 months of use and therefore holding the mouse button does not work
15	neg	Both take me directly back to the product page creating an endless cycle
16	neg	My husband plays wow and other pc games and this mouse didn’t last but a few months
16	neg	We purchased it April 2019 and are having issues with the buttons no longer working properly
16	neg	So it’s not user mishandling
17	pos	I chose the G502 Hero to replace my beloved G500 and am rather happy with this little guy
17	pos	I'm not a gamer, I use this mouse for work mostly doing data analysis and TSQL, so my wants & needs are quite a bit different than most
17	pos	Pros:- Since the weights are customizable, I still get to have the nice heavy mouse I've always loved
17	pos	- Granular DPI adjustments let me set up the speed just how I like it and lets me pick and choose just the right places for the 9,485 screenshots I need to take daily to show people why they're wrong
17	pos	- All buttons are able to be unassigned, so if you're not a gamer and you're worried about hitting the wrong thing, don't, it's not a big deal
17	pos	- The lighting is totally customizable, so if you don't want to see cool glowing lights on your mouse, don't
17	pos	If you think it's cool, have fun
17	pos	- Still ergonomic as ever
17	pos	I use mine with an old IMAK ergoBeads wrist pad and no pain
17	pos	- The cord is REALLY LONG, so if your main desktop/laptop/docking device is far away, it's not a problem
17	neg	Cons:- I prefer to have a clicking scroll wheel (you can also choose to have the scroll wheel free-scroll with the push of a button)
17	neg	It's kind of loud
17	neg	Not loud enough to bother anyone while I'm scrolling on a conference call, but louder than the G500
17	neg	- The bottom part to get to the weights is a little difficult to remove
18	neg	Waited and waited until I hung up exactly 15 minutes after no one replied
18	neg	Take my advice and don't waste your hard earn money in a company that can't stand behind their products
18	neg	The mouse went directly into the trash bin
19	neg	Trying to do anything with this mouse is now a hassle
19	neg	I'm not going to deal with such an absurd process, so while they may have saved on having to honor the warranty, they've lost a customer
19	neg	I'll never buy a Logitech product again
19	neg	Please don't make the same mistake I did
19	neg	Don't buy this
19	neg	You will get the same issue, almost guaranteed
19	neg	Aside from the issue above, the mouse has programmable DPI settings
19	pos	Which is nice, and only necessary because the default settings are weirdly too fast or too slow
19	neg	The buttons to change the DPI settings is in a spot where I constantly hit them accidentally, which is annoying, but I think that's more a me problem
19	neg	The RGB lights change colors, but the mouse doesn't remember that until the Logitech software you need to have is turned on
19	neg	The mouse wheel either spins freely, which is stupid, or turns into a chunky megalithic clickmonster if you lock it
19	neg	The scroll left/right by moving the mouse wheel left or right doesn't really work correctly
19	neg	Neither does pressing in the mouse wheel to scroll up or down by holding it
19	neg	It just stops
19	neg	Very frustrating
19	pos	Decent heavy duty cord, ergonomically ok, comfortable at least
19	neg	Bad business, that
19	neg	Again - don't buy this
19	neg	Odds are a cheap no-name brand would last longer
20	pos	UPDATE 4/21/20: Just received a warranty replacement for the mouse
20	pos	Increased my rating to 3 stars
20	neg	Still unhappy that the mouse broke so quickly, especially for the price and target use
20	neg	Beginning in March 2020, the mouse started acting funny
20	neg	The left mouse button would not work correctly in 2 ways: 1) single clicks were sent as double clicks and vice versa, and 2) click-and-drag stopped working
20	pos	Instead, it acted as if I released the mouse button mid-movement and then clicked again
20	neg	Both of these issues affect gaming, but they also affects work, as dragging formulas in Excel or moving e-mails to folders no longer work
20	neg	Also, trying to select a word or sentence by double-clicking is nearly impossible
20	neg	Searching Logitech's forums, this appears to be a known issue, reported by many users
20	neg	I have contacted Logitech support, but have not received a reply yet
20	neg	Otherwise, I would warn others to avoid a mouse that stops working correctly after only a few months
21	pos	I've used Logitech mice forever and they just keep going, so that'll likely be the last time I venture off to another brand
21	pos	Comparing these two, they have a very similar size, look and feel
21	pos	This one is nearly as heavy without the weights as was the M65 with all three weights
21	pos	I think I liked the M65's aluminum construction a bit better, but the plastic on this one doesn't leave anything to be desired and the grippy material on this mouse sides is a nice touch
21	pos	This unit's button placement is far superior over the M65, I don't find myself inadvertently activating any buttons like I did with the Corsair
21	pos	The scroll resistance on this mouse wheel is also a bit better, very defined clicks and it's also adjustable to free spin if desired
21	pos	It is comfortable enough to use as an every day mouse and has optional features that can be used for gaming
21	pos	Overall, I think this is a better mouse than the Corsair and so long as it holds up, I'll keep my review at 5 stars
21	neg	Update:  I'm starting to think these rather expensive gaming mice are just a cash grab
21	neg	The middle mouse button on this one failed to scroll properly after only 29 days of use
21	neg	Thank goodness I was still within the Amazon return window
21	neg	Something is wrong with the middle mouse button on these gaming mice, this is the second one from two different companies to fail shortly after purchase
21	neg	I'll get this one replaced, but my next mouse is going to be a cheap one
21	neg	At least they work reliably for a good long time
21	neg	This is unacceptable to have premature failures like this on $50 mice when the $12 special will go for a decade
21	pos	Update 2:  The replacement mouse has held up so far, so I'm upgrading the review stars a bit
21	neg	I do have semi-frequent problems with dust getting stuck in the laser's sensor area
21	neg	When this happens, I get really bad tracking and have to blow on it to clear whatever's in there
21	neg	Not super inconvenient, but also not a "feature" that I've seen from any other mouse that I've used in 20 years
21	neg	Update 3:  Middle mouse wheel failed at about 16 months, back down to 1 star
21	neg	I'm done with these expensive mice
21	neg	I'm either the unluckiest guy ever, or I suspect these are just a cash grab
22	pos	You can easily and quickly switch between the pre-programmed sensitivity or adjust your own sensitivity presets
22	pos	You can adjust the weight to your preference and it fits nicely in your hand
22	pos	Light effects are cool and you can customize the logo if you download the free Logitech software
22	neg	Now for the dislikes, and there are many
22	neg	The mouse does not increase my skill at videogames, I'm just able to get to where I'm going to die faster because I have better control
22	neg	This mouse does not help with my Call of Duty trash talk
22	pos	Maybe your mom can order one for you after I drop her off after our date
23	pos	The mouse specs are straight forward, and covered in the description of the product
23	pos	That was to be expected since Logitech already had phenomenal sensors so any difference is probably on the test results not human use
23	pos	That being said, I'll just do a quick pro, con list
23	pos	Pros:- Solid construction- good button placement- buttons are light, and crisp- Decent support software whether that is Logitech gaming software or the hub
23	pos	- Comparable price to competitor mice with similar features
23	neg	Cons:- Scroll wheel is not rubberized like the G900 and is very hard to grip
23	neg	- There is no comfort groove in the right mouse button like there is with the left (preference)- Mouse is heavy, even without the weights
23	neg	If you like to do flick shots or lift your mouse up you may feel fatigue over time compared to other Logitech mice that weigh around 75grams
23	neg	- Edit: There is no support for forward and backward scroll wheel as buttons in their software per this review
23	pos	Conclusion: This is a well priced product
23	pos	The sensor is incredible, comparable to other brands such as Roccat, Razer, and Steel Series (among others like Zowie)
23	pos	It is heavy, more for larger hands, and the scroll wheel could have been rubber for grip
23	pos	I'll personally use this for MOBAS and RTS but it is far too heavy for dedicated fps like Overwatch and COD
23	pos	I'd personally recommend the Logitech G Pro/Pro Hero if you are an FPS player that needs fewer buttons
24	pos	The design and ergonomics of this mouse are outstanding
24	pos	All the buttons are placed perfectly, the freewheeling ability of the scroll wheel makes traversing long web pages or documents incredibly easy
24	neg	Even the companion software doesn't give me that much to complain about
24	neg	But the Chinese Omron switches Logitech puts in this mouse are terrible, and Logitech knows it
24	neg	Within two months of my original purchase, I began experiencing the dreaded double click issue, and quickly opened a ticket with Logitech support
24	neg	Now, less than 10 months of only moderate use later, not only has the left click started to intermittently have the double clicking issue, but the mouse 5 button has failed entirely
24	neg	I have opened another support ticket, and hope to be able to get yet another replacement, but this is unacceptable
24	neg	They know these switches are bad
24	neg	Consumers have had to resort to repairing the switches themselves or even buying the higher quality Japanese made Omron switches to drop in as replacements
24	neg	If I do get a SECOND replacement (within only the first year of owning this mouse) I will gladly continue to use it until it too starts to display these issues, but I can't in good conscience recommend this mouse to anyone
24	neg	Which is a terrible shame because I love almost everything about it, but a mouse that cannot click things as intended is not a mouse worth paying for
25	neg	Many years ago Logitech was the go-to brand for computer peripherals but for the last decade my experience with their mice has been quite poor
25	pos	I have Logitech webcams that after many years are still great, an illuminated keyboard that's lasted a decade and a 5
25	pos	1 speaker set that's lasted even longer
25	pos	My first Logitech mouse the 518 similarly lasted many years before the middle mouse button started to fail
25	neg	Next I replaced it with another one which failed within a year
25	neg	After that I went to a G400 that within 2 years started to have button fails / produce the double click error
25	neg	Maybe it's a fluke, got another G400
25	neg	Failed at about a year
25	neg	Will try the G502, again not even a whole year before it started failing along with the double click error
25	neg	2nd G502 - same result 1 year
25	neg	This is in a dry, temperature controlled, clean environment with no liquids or foods being spilled on it
25	neg	I've already gotten the new out of retirement version of the Mx518 but if it produces the same result I'm looking elsewhere for my next mouse
25	neg	Update: I tried to return the two mice I had that were within warranty
25	neg	Logitech wants you to record yourself clicking the mouse over 100 times on a 3rd party site designed to check for double clicks while holding the serial number in the frame
25	neg	That's just the first step of the potential return process
25	neg	No more Logitech mice for me
25	neg	The double click issue is well know enough by Logitech to already have a process in place for you, not them to document it, then they know its a widespread issue and should stop wasting the customers time
26	neg	Update Aug 29, 2019: I submitted a support ticket to Logitech a week ago, and I have not gotten any response from their support other than the initial confirmation with the support ticket number
26	neg	The same day I submitted my support ticket I went and bought a SteelSeries Rival 600 to hold me over until I would hopefully receive a replacement from Logitech, but after using the Rival 600 I can say I will not be going back to Logitech for a gaming mouse ever again
26	neg	TL;DR: This mouse has a sensor issue present in both of the ones I have and the 2nd one I received directly from Logitech support had developed an issue with its right-click in only 3 months of use
26	neg	My first HERO mouse arrived at the beginning of April, and from day one I had some issues getting the thing configured
26	neg	Upon rebooting I attempted to install G Hub again only to yield the same issue I encountered before all of this taking on Windows 10 Pro 1809 at the time
26	pos	Now that the mouse had been configured to my preferred button layout and DPI setting, I was able to starting using it normally
26	pos	The new mouse was proving to be what I had hoped for, barring the earlier dilemma with the software
26	neg	Over the course of April I occasionally had something very strange happen while in use; at random times without predictors or warning my cursor on screen would shoot to one of the corners of my screen and get pinned there
26	neg	In FPS games this would cause my character to suddenly start staring at the ground or the sky while rapidly spinning in one direction, indicating that the mouse was perceiving continuous horizontal and vertical inputs despite the mouse being stationary
26	pos	This could only be interrupted by lifting the mouse off of the mousepad, a CORSAIR MM600,  and setting it back down, which would stop the constant input and everything would go back to normal
26	neg	In over 6 years of gaming on PC, 3 of which were with the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, I had never encountered any issue like this with any of the Razer or Logitech mice I had used up to that point
26	neg	Since I had confidently ruled out software, I decided to contact Logitech support
26	neg	After explaining everything to the support agent, they decided that they would send me a new replacement mouse which arrived only a few days later
26	neg	Within only a couple weeks I experienced the cursor issue again with the replacement HERO mouse from Logitech support, but it seemed to happen less often so I dealt with it
26	neg	It has been over 3 months since getting the replacement and now the replacement had developed its own issue with the right-click being unable to be consistently held down
27	neg	This is the second G502 I bought in my lifetime
27	pos	Now, I bought this G502, because the first one I bought worked really well
27	pos	It lasted a long while, no issues, and it's what has sold me on keeping on with Logi products
27	neg	Well, shame on me, because I've been fooled
27	neg	What's wrong with this new G502
27	neg	It just started up, and it's a doozy
27	neg	The mouse, when sitting still, sends signals to my PC to move my cursor, when
27	neg	I'm not even touching the mouse
27	neg	Not only that, but the mouse seems to disconnect from my pc and reset the DPI to a higher DPI than I'm comfortable with
27	neg	Basically, the mouse has a spasm and just does its own thing for a little while until it decides to say hello to the pc again
27	neg	What was wrong with the G903
27	neg	Bad, cheap, switches
27	neg	I did not learn about them until the G903 went kaput
27	neg	Logi uses cheap switches doomed to fail, fantastic
27	neg	After all this, I can't help but to be severely disappointed
27	neg	I bought this G502 a few days ago, it already has issues
27	neg	I certainly don't want to bother trying to get a refund from the stingy corporation that is Logi with cheap switches and horrible customer service
27	neg	Stay away from Logi mice until they decide to actually listen to the hundreds of thousands of people experiencing issues from Logi mice
28	neg	Purchased in September 2019 and and as of April 2020 it is broken
28	neg	The right click will not work correctly when held down which, in a fps game, has caused a ton of issues
28	neg	The buttons for the dpi switch are a seamless transition to the left click which will cause you to accidentally change your dpi in intense situations
28	pos	The mouse has a very lightweight feel which is great and the cable is a braided material which is a nice touch
28	neg	Overall I wouldn’t recommend this product
28	neg	The fact that it died in only 7 months is terrible
28	neg	There are some good qualities but comparing it to the downsides I just can’t recommend that anyone buys it
28	neg	Don’t go with the high reviews, they are all from a short term perspective
29	neg	The mouse started double clicking a few months after first use (like 2 or 3 months)
29	neg	I needed the mouse and decided I could live with it but now (5 months) it's become very bad
29	neg	It double click 90% of the time and it also decides to move a few centimeters every now on then on its own
30	neg	Software didn't behave properly for most of its lifetime (it wouldn't open), just recently did an update fix what issue was causing it
30	neg	As for the product itself, I use it lightly on a daily basis and yet, I've come across the same issue many others have
30	neg	Mouse is double clicking on its own, when I mean to single click
30	neg	Overall, I feel like this mouse is not worth the money at all, I paid less than half for off brand mouse with better quality and longer lifespan (~2 years before being replaced by this one)
30	neg	In a you get what you pay for manner, I understandably replaced my previous chinese offbrand mouse with this new logitech mouse
31	neg	This mouse is extremely comfortable, unfortunately I'm in the process of filing a warranty claim for a second replacement
31	neg	The ghost click/double click issue has affected my original purchase, and the replacement, and I expect it to affect any additional replacements issued
31	neg	When I am out of the warranty period and they will no longer provide replacements, I will find another brand
31	neg	The first replacement was no hassle - describe issue and sent a new one out
31	neg	The second has been a nightmare
31	neg	I have spent hours jumping through hoops to document the issue even though it's widely publicized
31	neg	I have gone so far as to recording a video of the issue with the mouse and serial number in the screen and it was still met with disbelief and hassle
31	neg	After clearing my desk to have several different attempts at this video, I have attempted to contact supervisors to no avail
31	neg	I'd advise not to purchase any logitech products and I have heard similar issues with their other peripherals
32	neg	Well here I am, outside of the return window, still not "adjusted' to the mouse's shape and size
32	neg	The mouse is just too small, I don't have particularly big hands, if anything they're average sized
32	neg	I cannot find a comfortable grip of this mouse
32	neg	When I place my hand how it most naturally fits on the mouse, the extra buttons are out of reach
32	neg	When I put my whole hand on the mouse (so that the top of my palm touches), my fingers extend over the extra buttons so I have to awkwardly press them with my joints
32	pos	The profile feature of the mouse is nice, with different sets of DPI adjustments for switching between shooters and casual browsing
32	neg	Ultimately what I'm looking for in a mouse  is comfort during use and I did not find it here
32	neg	If you have small hands go for it, otherwise, assess other options
33	pos	I'd heard people preaching how good the G502 was for quite awhile, but I was hesitant to try it
33	pos	After having used the Logitech G Pro mouse for the last year, I decided I was ready to try something different
33	pos	Don't get me wrong, the Pro is a great mouse, but it's very lightweight which I didn't find terribly comfortable to use (it makes sense in the Pro gamer context, though, so I get it
33	pos	) The G502 is perfect
33	pos	It's hefty, and you can customize it using the weights
33	pos	The button placement is nearly perfect (I find the thumb button a tad hard to reach for my hands) and, like the Pro, the Hero engine is incredibly accurate and satisfying to use
33	pos	I've ended up using it as my all day mouse, even for work, as it's just so pleasant in the hand
33	pos	If you're looking for a great mouse at a very reasonable price point, give the G502 a try
33	pos	(There's also a wireless version available now, but it's considerably more expensive at time of writing
34	pos	This mouse is fantastic
34	pos	It's sturdy, it's comfortable, the laser is amazing and never skips around
34	neg	If it's too expensive for you just go with the G203
34	pos	I believe they have the same tech on the inside but just fewer bells and whistles
34	pos	I own both and they are both fantastic
34	neg	Edit to review:After just a few months, both right and left mouse clickers are malfunctioning
34	neg	The left one double clicks almost every time I click it (already attempted several "fixes" but it appears to be the hardware as nothing the all knowing google has to suggest has worked) and the left one will not maintain a click when I hold it down (for games such as Call of Duty this is detrimental as I am unable to maintain a zoom in with scopes)
34	neg	Because of this, I am lowering my 5-star review to 2 stars
34	neg	This should happen
34	neg	I would expect this type of issue from some off brand Chinese sweat-shop mouse
34	neg	I expect much more from Logitech
35	neg	This is my 5th g502, the previous 4 all came down with stuttery button issues that everyone has, and trust me they all WILL do this given enough time and use
35	neg	In the past Logitech made good mice that lasted so long I would wear a hole through the left button before it developed any problems but now I don't even have them last long enough to need teflon tape on the feet, they get the click problem anywhere from 2 to 6 months and need to be replaced
35	neg	If there was another mouse that worked as well and fit my hand just right I'd love to stop throwing g502's  in the landfill but I haven't found it yet
35	neg	Buy it on sale and make sure you buy two so you have a spare when the button goes south
36	neg	Logitech used to be pretty good back in the day
36	neg	The only reason this is getting 2-stars and not 1 is because while it worked, it was a good design
36	neg	I use this mouse for standard daily work and light gamming
36	neg	I've had this mouse for just over a year and a half (and another Logitech trackball previously)
36	neg	Just like my previous Logitech hardware, the buttons are sub-par
36	neg	When it was working correctly, I enjoyed using this mouse
36	neg	It has buttons place where they are easily used "reachable" and worked pretty well for what I intended
36	neg	"However, it is having the same ""press the left mouse button once it automatically double clicks issue"" that my previous trackball developed"
36	neg	I believe this is an ongoing (YEARS) issue with Logitech and their particular buttons
36	pos	Hopefully, it will be better than this
36	neg	This was my last Logitech purchase
36	neg	I have a much cheaper mouse (Redragon, with less buttons) that has taken way more abuse than this mouse and still works perfectly
37	pos	There are 3 buttons that are dpi adjusters on this beast out of the box
37	pos	The YouTube videos are probably easier to understand, but hey, I tried
37	pos	Hopefully this points at least one person in the right direction
38	pos	First off, 11 programmable buttons + Gshift
38	pos	This  pairs great with games that demand more marcos with games like BDO, SCUM, and all the other titles that have a bit more commands
38	neg	I couldn't do this with my Corsair Glaive Pro and tbh, spending $60 then compared to this made me regret everything
38	pos	The program that comes with this mouse is foreign at first, but in the end, gets simple to use
38	pos	I have both the Ique (Corsiar keyboard) paired with this mouse and both run great with each other
38	pos	I personally dont like the looks, but the utility of this mouse, makes me love the heck out of this
38	pos	If you are looking for the best under $50 gaming mouse, this has to the the top pick in my opinion
38	pos	Do yourself a favor when you buy this mouse - learn it, and learn about all the different things you can do it with
38	pos	Trust me its worth knowing the hundreds of different configs and things you can do with this mouse and the program together
39	pos	I am writing this after having the mouse a day and a half, so things may change
39	pos	So far this mouse is working great for me both in Linux and Windows as I am using it through a KVM
39	pos	My previous older gaming mouse had a few different limitations that really stuck out once I went up to higher resolution and could more consistently hold higher frame rates
39	pos	Basically at the higher display capabilities my old mouse movements looks rather stuttery and jerky
39	pos	This mouse has solved this with some rather quick and easy tuning
39	pos	Turned down mouse sensitivity in Windows, Linux, and in games
39	pos	At the same time turned up DPI resolution on the mouse
39	pos	"The main thing you are really after is turning off ""mouse acceleration"""
39	pos	The difference in smoothness is night and day
39	pos	I simply did not have the mouse resolution and responsiveness before, at least for first person shooters
39	pos	With this mouse and a few quick tweaks I do
39	pos	Can run this mouse on smoother, very low static friction free surfaces
39	pos	This mouse can do it, so problem solved
39	pos	This mouse allows balancing with weights
39	pos	I guesstimated where I thought I needed the weights and so far it is working out pretty nice
39	pos	The mouse has a memory, so once it is setup under Windows, it is setup everywhere in terms of DPI settings and polling rate
39	pos	Make mouse adjustments such as sensitivity levels in X windows and in games and enjoy
39	pos	The main games to benefit from this are FPS (first person shooter) games
39	pos	Other games any old mouse will do, but it wasn't those games that pushed you to get this mouse, right
39	pos	As a summary, even within a few hours of having this mouse I am finding that I am not getting nauseous as much with FPS gaming, movement looks a lot smoother, and I am quickly getting in a lot more shots and especially a lot more sniping head shots
39	pos	Even in a window manager doing things like grabbing the edge of a window to move it around is a lot easier now
39	pos	While some may debate whether this mouse is as good as another mouse currently on the market, at least going from an older generation gaming mouse to this one is a big improvement
39	pos	"I would consider the result from this mouse once finding the right settings to be ""perfect tracking"""
40	pos	As an entry level gaming mouse it's decent
40	pos	I switched to Logitech over others like Corsair due to the size and the features
40	pos	I have large hands and I claw grip my mouse
40	pos	Logitech fits my hand better
40	pos	It's cheap, however
40	neg	Two have failed on me in under a year
40	neg	I'll be going back to Mad Catz now that they fixed their quality issues
40	pos	But I'm not complaining, Logitech is decent, cheap - and replaceable
40	pos	I think it's over complicated for mouse only
40	pos	Others' may be better or worse, I don't know
40	pos	I don't tend to save macros or do any custom programming
40	pos	I prefer to just change dpi and the LED
41	neg	I needed to replace my 11 year old G500 mouse due to wire issues
41	pos	This G502 is quite similar in design and feel
41	pos	I use it mostly for general computer use and only occasional gaming
41	neg	But there is one flaw in the design of the G502 for me
41	neg	"the speed of movement (DPI setting) button for ""faster"" is located so close to the left click button that I am consantly tripping it accidentally as I work"
41	neg	"Suddenly, the cursor is flying across the screen so fast I can't find it and I have to stop and hit the ""slower"" button to return to the speed I want"
41	neg	I never had this problem with the G500 because the speed buttons were lower down the side of the mouse and never were activated by mistake
41	pos	I do like that the extra buttons work without having to install the mouse software
41	pos	The software does add extra customization capability, but I do not need it for my uses
41	pos	Overall, I recommend this mouse
41	pos	It is well built and feels like it will last a long time
41	pos	I just hope I can train myself to not accidentally hit that poorly placed DPI button
42	pos	I really like this mouse
42	pos	I added all the included weights and it gives the mouse a very solid feel
42	pos	It's comfortable and well designed
42	pos	I hooked up to my existing Logitech Gaming Software and replaced my old mouse importing the custom profiles perfectly
42	pos	All I needed to do was adjust the DPI to my liking
42	pos	But I also purchased a new keyboard and had to install the G Hub software because the the Gaming Software was just too old and didn't support the new kb
42	neg	The G Hub wares replaces the old Gaming Software and this is where the problems started
42	neg	The G Hub software is horrible
42	neg	Seriously, just do a quick Google search and you'll see a LOT of complaints about it
42	neg	It took all day to figure it out and create new profiles and make it recognize games
42	neg	No help could be found on the Logitech site and Google offered little help
42	neg	Eventually I was able to make everything work as I wanted but it was a frustrating day
42	pos	Final comment, this mouse is great and I recommend it
42	neg	But the G Hub software should be avoided if you can
42	pos	If you do not already own Logitech gear, look elsewhere
43	pos	Let me start by saying i've been through almost every mouse trying to find the one
43	pos	I needed one that was heavy, thick, had lots of buttons and was solid
43	pos	Corsair has constantly let me down with going through over 9 mice in just under three years between two people on several rigs
43	pos	Razer is usually overpriced and doesn't feel that great
43	pos	Logitech comes in clutch
43	pos	This thing is built like a tank
43	pos	It's heavy
43	pos	It's solid
43	pos	It has tons of program options, and the software is a joy to work with
43	pos	The RGB LEDs are fully programable
43	pos	The cable feels pretty solid
43	pos	It's accurate
43	pos	The control of the mouse is great
43	pos	Three clickers is the new norm
43	pos	Getting used to it takes about two to three days, but when you do, its like wow, why didn't we normalize this sooner
43	pos	I play league and wow, genshin impact, stardew valley, and almost any survival horror game that comes out
43	pos	Works great for everything
43	pos	As well I use this in my recording studio as my macro mighty mouse
43	pos	Keybinding things on the go for quick and easy access
43	pos	Again, works great
43	pos	10/10This is far superiors to any other mmo mouse out IMO
43	neg	My only gripe is because its so big, and if you have little hands, you might get some wrist, hand cramps
43	neg	If I game for 10+ hours it really starts to become an issue
43	pos	Just know that its fat and thiccc, and feels amazing
43	pos	Just too much of an amazing thing can sometimes get to be a bother
44	pos	I've had the mouse for a little while now
44	pos	First, I want to say that if you're on the fence about this mouse, then just go for it
44	pos	It's a great mouse
44	pos	Pros:Removable weights allow you to customize how hefty it is in hand
44	pos	I added all the weights and enjoy it being a heavier mouse
44	pos	DPI settings are great
44	pos	Really let's you set your sensitivity level and quickly make changes to it based on what you're doing
44	pos	Customizable lighting
44	pos	You will need to download the app, but you can change the lighting to what color you want and also how it lights up or reacts to sound
44	pos	This mouse feels great in the hand
44	pos	I have large hands and it still feels great to me
44	pos	The grips and textures compliment your hand quite well and I've not had any issues with it
44	neg	Cons:DPI buttons are a little too close to the left mouse button
44	neg	This has caused me to inadvertently change DPI settings a few times
44	neg	It's easy and fast to switch back, but can be annoying
44	pos	I feel this mouse could be wider for a better fill of my hand
44	pos	However, it might be too much for others with smaller hands
44	pos	Overall, the negatives are minimal at best
44	pos	This has been an amazing mouse so far and I'm really enjoying it
45	pos	Pros:Solid sensor, good programmable button options, software worked well on Windows 10 and Mac OSX
45	pos	Wired, so no dealing with batteries, chargers, connections, or lag
45	pos	The rubber on the side grips feels good
45	pos	Settings can be saved to onboard memory, so the color and speed and button tweaks work on any machine, not just ones with the driver and your profile installed, unlike Razor
45	neg	Cons:Feels light/cheap even with the added weights, like every piece of plastic was as thin as they could make it without it shattering during shipping
45	neg	It does it less when you turn off freewheel and use clicky wheel, but it's still audible there, too
45	neg	Some settings don't seem to be editable in onboard memory, you have to download the profile, update it there, then re-upload it
45	neg	Wouldn't be a big deal, but you can't even view the button customizations without downloading, it just tells you how many buttons were programmed, not what they do
45	neg	Not built for large hands - feels 80% of normal size
46	pos	Bought it thinking I was getting a good deal since it was on sale for $40 at the time of purchase
46	neg	As it would be a good replacement after the micro switches in my G9x died
46	neg	The profile is bit high and it kind of hurts my index finger, its as if my index and middle fingers are slightly extended
46	neg	I'm not sure if I have a defective product but the mouse wheel is off balanced
46	neg	If you slowly move the mouse wheel up in increments (as if you're browsing a webpage), the wheel will slightly rock backwards
46	neg	At first I thought it was some kind of issue with the scroll bar in my browser, spent a good evening trying to locate a bug in Chrome that didn't exist, and it was the mouse wheel the entire time
46	neg	Looked up the issue online and apparently this is a common production flaw with the G502 series
46	neg	The only real fix is to buy a replacement mouse wheel but for G500/G500s and swap it in
46	neg	If you're shopping around for a Logitech mouse, please try and avoid any mice with this mouse wheel type
46	neg	Furthermore, having to use G Hub to program the mouse is an absolute nightmare of an experience, honestly I think I hated having to use that software than the issue with the mouse wheel
46	neg	Save yourself the frustration, anger, and rage and download the Logitech Gaming Software 9
46	pos	Hope this helps and happy shopping
47	neg	WARNING, This product to function correctly requires you to install literal spyware
47	neg	It requires Logitech G-hub and Gaming framework
47	neg	Why does my mouse require a 100% Uptime Service running in the backround
47	neg	Data collection pure and simple
47	neg	IN order to sue this mouse you must install the software and service
47	neg	When you install and run this software to use your mouse, you agree to give the following data to logitech
47	neg	-Location information and IP address
47	neg	Data related to the discovery of devices you connect, like a new Logitech G mouse or keyboard
47	neg	-Other device and system activity including feature usage, performance metrics, errors, crash data, etc
47	neg	This alone gives them full access to essentially everything on your system, what games you play, when you play them, who you login under, every error you get, everytime you restart
47	neg	IT DOES NOT MATTER, IF ITS ON YOUR PC ITS BEING LOGGED AND HANDED TO LOGITECH)Other then that, the mouse functions, Besides the DOUBLEC CLICK
47	neg	Or the Stick Left clickmaybe the Left click that clicks, but does not do anything, then you have to really press it in and it registers, or tap your finger on a different spot
48	pos	Now to run my favorite source games and bind some certain commands to my scroll wheel
49	neg	I use programmable mice to speed up programming tasks
49	neg	The programmable buttons on this mouse have weak action and are easy to press by accident
49	neg	The previous logitech mouse I used for years (sadly no longer available) worked much better
49	neg	I would be willing to put up with this inferior replacement for its predecessor except after a couple of weeks it started misbehaving
49	neg	The cursor would start randomly moving
49	neg	"The mouse was sending a continual ""right"" or ""up"" or other signal to the computer"
49	neg	Sometimes the mouse would return to normal use with some vigorous scrolling
49	neg	Sometimes I would have to disconnect/reconnect the USB to get it to work again
49	neg	The final straw was when I accidentally deleted a document when the mouse decided to move just as I was clicking
49	neg	I looked around the internet and apparently this has been a common problem for years that Logitech cannot be bothered to fix
49	neg	"I tried seven ""solutions"" to the problem including new drivers, new firmware, and turning off power saving features"
49	neg	Nothing worked
49	neg	I was also sad to see the Logitech, after all these years, is still using the most counter-intuitive app to program the mouse I have ever seen
49	neg	Until Logitech decides that quality is important I am done with their mice
50	pos	I'll preface this by saying I've pretty much been a one-brand guy for the last 10+ years when it comes to computer peripherals - pretty much every mouse, keyboard, and webcam I've purchased since starting to build computers has been a Logitech product
50	pos	This mouse was great
50	neg	while it lasted
50	neg	About 6 months after purchasing, the mouse lost the ability to hold a left-click
50	neg	In other words, you'd click and hold the left mouse button to drag something, but the mouse would let off the hold even though you were still holding the left mouse button down
50	neg	This makes any task that involves dragging and dropping (or drawing something by holding the left mouse button) infuriating if not impossible
50	neg	After reading around, it sounds like it's a known hardware issue with this mouse
50	neg	Unfortunately, Logitech's support answer is to try spraying compressed air in the mouse to clear any debris - this did not work
50	neg	I submitted a support request to Logitech and haven't heard back in a week
50	neg	I certainly won't buy another G502 to replace this one, and I'll have to consider other brands based on this experience
51	pos	This is absolutely the best mouse that I've ever owned
51	neg	But you need to understand that the issues mentioned in review after review are correct and widespread
51	neg	If Logitech were to actually fix these issues, they'd likely have about 99% of the market
51	neg	The issue for mine occurred in the right button and involved double clicks/the button not recognizing being held
51	neg	It was a hardware issue, not a software one as I had a separate Logitech to test the software
51	neg	The same issue has just started to pop up for a friend as well with their system
51	neg	Double clicks/phantom presses/non-consistent presses
51	neg	Save yourself the aggravation and find a more reliable mouse, even if this one will be the best one you'll ever have (until issues pop up)
51	neg	I guess this is why the G502 has been taken off quite a few updated mouse buying guides
52	pos	First thing I noticed, the free spinning of the scroll wheel is completely useless
52	pos	I thought for a moment I was going to have to return the mouse, then realized there's a button to turn off free spin
52	neg	Then it's super clunky, better, not great
52	neg	Continuing with the scroll wheel, using the associated button is hit or miss
52	neg	Half the time it seems to not trigger until I let go of pushing it and then the timing is completely off, obviously
52	neg	There's a sticky area for grip by your thumb that really should have been the place to put the side mouse buttons, they would have been much easier to use
52	pos	The movement seems fine so far
52	neg	The issues really stem from button placement and a VERY horrible scroll wheel
52	neg	I would not get this mouse again even though it's #1 in computer mice category at the time of this review
52	neg	I don't know if I can return it after a couple weeks use, but, I'm going to see
52	pos	For reference, I came from a Logitech MX518 and wanted more buttons which is what brought me to this mouse
53	neg	I am so very disappointed with this mouse, so-called one of the best gamer mouse at the moment
53	neg	I couldn't stand using it for more than an hour, and had to switch back to my cheap, 6-year-old, discontinued, MSI Interceptor DS200
53	neg	I wish I've done more research before buying and did not get carried away with the gamer community reviews
53	neg	There are two main reasons for me not liking this mouse: the wheel (which is poorly designed in many ways) and the Logitech software
53	pos	In almost every other aspect the mouse is very good
53	pos	It looks great, very comfortable for the hand, and the thumb button setup is just perfect
53	neg	THE WHEEL, OMG THE WHEEL
53	neg	How a little part can be so flawed to totally ruin the experience
53	neg	The very first thing you will notice when you unbox the mouse is that the wheel is released and will spin freely
53	neg	After freaking out for a second you will also notice that there is a button that will lock the wheel allowing for the use we all like and need
53	neg	However, there are three problems with the locked wheel: The first is that it is extremely noisy, more than you can imagine
53	neg	The second is that it does not scroll easily, the movement is not smooth at all
53	neg	And the third is that the wheel is made of metal, which causes your finger to slide occasionally (when the wheel is locked) and miss a few scrolls, which is a big flaw
53	neg	And finally, there is the rattling sound
53	neg	As soon as you start moving the mouse with moderate speed you will feel like something is loose in the inside
53	neg	It is the wheel, again, moving from side to side, clashing against the plastic, and this is very, very annoying
53	neg	There are some YouTube tutorials that teach you how to stick a tape on the side to prevent the rattling
53	neg	Although I'm not into cheap hacks to my new hardware I was about to accept all these flaws and try to get used to them as soon as possible
53	neg	But then I met the Logitech software problem
53	pos	LOGITECH VS LOGITECHI have a Logitech G910 keyboard which I love and I have been using for quite some time, along with the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS)
53	pos	The LGS is supposed to detect your Logitech hardware and let you configure all of them from one place
53	neg	However, despite my efforts LGS never detected my G502 mouse
53	neg	That left me no choice but to download and install G-Hub, a newer Logitech software that is supposed to be better than LGS
53	neg	But it's not, It's actually much worse, although it did detect my keyboard and my mouse
53	neg	G-Hub is poorly designed, it is bugged and it is missing many cool features that LGS had, making a hassle out of the simpler tasks like coloring your keyboard for a specific game, or keeping a custom default DPI for the mouse
53	neg	Also, the import feature for your LGS profiles is just broken
53	neg	G-Hub wont import anything and you will lose all your LGS customizations and macros
53	neg	Ok, I thought: maybe I can use G-Hub for the mouse and LGS for the keyboard
53	neg	Nope, Logitech wont let you use both, and as soon as you install G-Hub it will block LGS
53	neg	I was not keen to ruin my experience with the G-910 in order to use a flawed mouse, so I decided I will not use the G502 for now
53	neg	I live outside of the US and getting a refund is not an option
53	neg	Besides, the mouse is not broken, it's just flawed by design
54	pos	So, this mouse is really good for what it's supposed to do, which is be a mouse
54	pos	It responds well, I haven't had any of the issues I normally do with other brands such as Corsair, like buttons not responding, registering 2 clicks when it was only one, the wheel giving out or just generally dying after a few months
54	pos	But at the same time the design is frankly, just weird
54	pos	The left click button is on the thin side, which I never seem to have an issue with having thin fingers myself
54	neg	But right beside the left click button are 2 buttons that will adjust the speed of your pointer on screen and these 2 buttons are entirely too easy to misclick with even the slightest shift of your finger
54	neg	Causing a lot of unnecessary and aggravating deaths or stealth breaks
54	pos	I would buy this mouse again, but it would have to be without those 2 buttons, or at least have a function on the app that doesn't force me into an insane dpi
55	neg	This Logitech G502 Hero mouse is garbage
55	neg	I own three and within 6-9 months of light-to-moderate use in a climate-controlled room, all three now consistently double-click on a single press, or release the click while I’m still holding the button down
55	neg	This makes FPS games impossible as releasing the right mouse button will un-scope my ranged weapon
55	neg	For regular use, accidental double clicks will open files or links I didn’t intend to
55	neg	I have accidentally opened a few folders, only to have to use my keyboard to go back safely
55	neg	I will not purchase Logitech again
56	pos	The mouse feels great, just like my 6 year old g502 that finally bit the bullet on me
56	pos	Good weight, good cable, scrolling and buttons all feel good
56	neg	"The one huge giant issue I've already run into in my first week of owning it is the new version of the horrible ""G HUB"" software"
56	neg	It constantly ignores my profile and button assignments
56	neg	I have the mouse set to use 400 dpi with all profile switching and DPI switching buttons disabled
56	neg	At least once a day I need to un plug and re plug in my mouse as it seems to go to the default 1200 dpi, and ignores all my configured buttons
56	neg	This alone really makes the mouse feel like a huge pain in the butt, and a real step down from the previous model
57	neg	"The mechanical aspects of the wheel also are very poor, as the ""free wheel"" and the ""resistance mode"" of the mouse feel pretty much the same, resistance mode I can almost free spin the mouse to the same extent of free wheel"
57	neg	Added to the fact that it just feels clunky, loose, and wobbles around making a rattling sound when Im using it
57	neg	I was feeling more like the mouse wheel was made for some $3 trash mouse you would buy in a swap meet and they just threw it in there
57	neg	I dont know exactly what it was about the design, but from the first moment I used it, it just felt wrong in my hand
57	neg	Perhaps it was just some small aspect of how they designed the body but it really felt like the fit was just off
57	pos	They could also start using optical switches for the main buttons which would make me feel better about the longevity and accuracy of the item as well
57	neg	Considering their closest competitor has made a product without these glaring flaws it may behoove Logitech to get on the ball and make some serious design changes
57	neg	Im sending this one back
58	pos	I got this to attempt to replace my wonderful, but old and failing, Logitech G700s mouse
58	neg	It has fewer buttons and they are arranged differently from the 700s model
58	pos	I use it for productivity and not gaming, so the buttons are for copying, deleting and moving around web pages
58	neg	It has the same three top, left edge buttons, but they are spaced further apart with less tactile feel
58	neg	This model suffers from a design or manufacturing flaw
58	neg	It has a replaceable bottom plate that covers a recessed area where you can install thin pieces of metal to change the weight of the mouse
58	neg	So when you press one of the main buttons, the mouse rocks forward and then back
58	neg	That causes the laser tracker to move your cursor
58	neg	So you point and click, but the mouse moves the cursor a little, so you miss your target
58	pos	Removing and keeping the bottom plate off allows the mouse to work just fine
58	neg	The weights are friction fit, so they stay in place
58	neg	I'm afraid to bump the mouse too hard, though, as that might dislodge one or more of the weights
58	neg	The Logitech Gaming Software works well enough but is not intuitive or easy to master for productivity
58	neg	It seems the manufacturers of mice aren't aware that multi-button mice are being used for productivity as well as gaming
58	neg	I marked it down one star for the software and button arrangement, and down two more stars for the bottom plate defect
59	neg	The media could not be loaded
59	neg	Hype and marketing aside, this mouse has serious flaws, immediate quality control ones as well as general design ones
59	neg	The BAD:This mouse doesn’t glide side-to-side or up-and-down as much as it scratches and grinds all over the place
59	neg	Issue here is the new and NOT improved weight system
59	neg	Unlike the old push-of-a-button slide out tray on G500, the boomerang shaped weights need to be wedged into the bottom of the mouse once you pop the side corner and peel off the underside
59	neg	(By the way, this is completely counter intuitive and not mentioned in the tiny sheet of a paper that passes for a “manual”
59	neg	What happened with the button-push system
59	neg	) The entire door is held, barely at that, by a super weak 1g magnet and two tiny plastic latches that seem like a major part endurance oversight
59	neg	As reported on reddit and elsewhere, the mouse underside weights compartment door does not close all the way
59	neg	There is some give and it makes the mouse uneven on the bottom
59	neg	But even on a cloth mat after a few hours there were tracks and tiny rips in the cloth material
59	neg	How the mighty have fallen
59	neg	Another issue is plastic
59	neg	Cheap plastic everywhere that is
59	neg	Nowadays even never-heard-of-brands making “Cool Gamer RGB overload” mice for $10-$15 come with rubberized coating
59	neg	Other than the side grips, the entirety of G502 is cheap slick plastic which will make the mouse slide around… well, grind around let’s be honest
59	neg	Also, it has been shrunken in all possible dimensions compared to G500
59	neg	It is narrower, shorter and much lower than the G500
59	neg	Seems like something designed for your average teenage/tween hand, which I’m sure is the target demographic now anyway
59	neg	All in all, all of the above can explained by down-costing
59	neg	This mouse (G502) screams “cut-costs”, for the manufacturer that is
59	neg	You, the user, are still expected to pay 2 to 2
59	neg	Smaller, more plasticky with horrible QC and design decisions
59	neg	(The underside of the mouse does not shut clean making the bottom of the mouse uneven
59	neg	How was this overlooked
59	pos	)The GOOD:The sensor is top notch
59	pos	While not majorly improved, the increase in precision is noticeable and measurable vs G500 for instance
59	pos	Cord is pretty nice
59	pos	Extremely flexible and seems to be of high quality
59	neg	Something easily frayed G500 cord could have used
59	pos	Logitech software is still intuitive, relatively low resource, and available in most common language including English
59	neg	Summary:Downcosted all around, overly plasticky, poor quality control, worse than poor design choices, lack of rubberized coating where needed, shrunken, shrunken, tiny, TINY, mouse
59	neg	10 years ago this would have been a… well, still a downgrade to a G500, but not many options were as available back then, so it might have been an option of some  kind
59	neg	How the mighty have fallen
60	pos	Been using Logitech mice for decades, love the features, the customization, the utility, the ergonomics, & this mouse does well in most of those categories
60	neg	But, for me anyway, for my uses it has a major flaw: It's kind of small, so anyone who uses a Palm Mouse Grip will find it uncomfortable
60	pos	That factor comes into play during long/er gaming sessions, because to a large degree it majorly reduces hand fatigue & maximizes comfort
60	neg	But this mouse is small/er, so I have to use a modified Claw Grip on it, & using that grip makes me hand hurt
60	neg	I've used Palm Grip gaming mice for so long, I may be able to adjust somewhat to using Claw Grip mouse, but the whole reason I stopped using Claw Grip mice is because it gave me hand pain & carpal tunnel
60	neg	I'm disappointed because I really like the RGB & the features of the new Logitech 'G' software, but I will most likely be returning this mouse
61	pos	I wanted to like this mouse
61	neg	For starters, it's weirdly draggy and a bit heavy, even wired and with zero weights in it"
61	pos	I can't see anyone wanting to add more of the included weights - the point of this kind of mouse is to start LIGHT and let you tune it, not start heavy and let you make it worse
61	neg	Genuinely heavier than my full size WIRELESS teknet mouse that I use for my media PC
61	neg	Replacement feet are not readily found, you're gonna be using teflon tape
61	neg	The combination of really meh feet and really heavy/draggy weight makes the mouse wildly imprecise after only a couple months
61	neg	"Even with teflon tape over the feet, I still can't make a ""clean"" drag across my mousepad with a smooth cursor movement"
61	neg	Not even sure it would when it was new
61	neg	I think it's just because the 502 has SIX absolutely gigantic pads, and other mice I use tend to have 3 or 4 much smaller feet at most, which keeps the inherent friction lower
61	pos	Cord is okay if used with a mouse bungie
61	neg	The scroll wheel is abysmal
61	neg	It has a side/side rock, which is already not good for a proper gaming mouse (they all have a habit of mis-registering mouse 3 clicks) but this is easily the worst I've ever experienced
61	neg	I am used to the design, but this one is so bad and vague that I had to straight up disable the rocker, so now I only get about 15% of my middle clicks mis-sensed
61	neg	mouse 4 is just set too far back
61	neg	"You have to press it with the knuckle of your thumb, which requires an incredibly awkward ""palm pinch"""
61	neg	If you use all the mouse buttons in a game, you're going to hate this thing so much
61	neg	And the thing is INCREDIBLY fragile
61	neg	My first one's left click broke just sliding off my chair onto carpet, the whole mouse button itself sheared off
61	neg	The second one's L2 switch itself is now failing, as it registers right click but doesn't register HOLDING it
61	neg	After only a year, this is appalling
61	neg	If you play MMO's, this makes steering an absolute nightmare
61	neg	If you play FPS games, right click iron sight/scope becomes agony
61	neg	This one is getting hucked in the garbage because it fell to pieces in a little over a year and a half
61	neg	I am staying away from Logitech for a few years after two absolutely atrocious peripherals and going back to the good old iron duke of a Razer Deathadder
62	pos	It was an amazing mouse, never had issues
62	pos	Figured a newer version would be better
62	neg	"Lots of people are plagued by weird ""stuttering"" on this mouse"
62	neg	You can google it and find dozens on dozens of reports of it, with virtually no solutions
62	neg	Lots of placebo and then they come back and report the issue came back
62	pos	"Logitech G Hub used to have a ""tuning"" option where you could tinker with settings and calibrate the mouse to that mouse pad"
62	pos	Worked great with Proteus
62	neg	Hero doesn't have that and/or Logitech removed the tuning option entirely
62	neg	So this option which possibly would fix the issue is no longer available
62	neg	I bought 2 new mouse pads that I didn't want - soft fabric type and one that is a bit thicker fabric like a traditional mouse pad
62	neg	At first I thought maybe it improved but I still get the issue
62	neg	The mouse will stutter especially if I try to move fast to click something precise, or highlight text
62	neg	I have shaky hands sometimes but this thing looks like I'm taking the mouse off the matt or something
62	pos	Which, interestingly, is a nice way to reproduce the issue
62	neg	Logitech ceased responding to me when I raised the issue
62	neg	Such a disappointment
63	pos	This mouse is precision
63	pos	Everything works precisely and is accurate
63	pos	Nice to be able to change dpi on the fly
63	pos	Where it shines:  Precision and smooothe sliders make it a snag free accurate mouse, clicky scroll wheelmouse cable never noticed while in use
63	pos	I drag my pinky and ring finger very loosely off the right side, on to the mouse pad
63	neg	ANY other grip is PAINFUL
63	neg	I'm NOT SAYING it doesn't work WELL, just that it has extremely limited grip styles
63	pos	I personally prefer for the mouse to support my other fingers
63	pos	I am paying the mouse after all
63	neg	Lazy brat mouse
63	pos	Anyway The G 502 is functionally awesome, ergonomically lacking for large (meaning AVERAGE sized adult MALE) hands
64	neg	The G502 is a great mouse except it's difficult to use without activating one of the G4 or G5 buttons, especially when lifting to reposition
64	pos	One of the reasons for this is the sides of the mouse body are too straight up and down which cause ones fingers to slide up
64	pos	Overall the mouse seems robustly built but I feel that all of the switches activate with too light and too shallow of a press
64	pos	Otherwise, it's a great gaming mouse except the thumb scoop needs to be bigger/deeper
65	neg	Had this mouse for 2 years and for the past year it has been giving problems DAILY
65	neg	When you press and hold a mouse button it will either "release", even though you are continuing to hold the button, or will double click instead of holding
65	neg	This makes selecting text impossible as it resets the initial point of selection
65	neg	I can't copy and paste text with this mouse at all
65	neg	Tried multiple computers - same result
65	neg	Any other mouse - works fine (including cheaper logitech ones)
65	neg	G502 is defective and you can see a lot of videos and read reports of these problems
65	neg	It feels good in the hand, but impossible to use
65	neg	Forget about gaming of any sort since it will not do what you tell it to do
66	neg	The recent versions show a lack of quality in workman ship
66	pos	I have an original Logitech from 8+ years ago, still works 100% of the time
66	neg	I've got 5 broken G502s in the past year that don't last 4-6 months before it starts having quality issues
66	neg	Issues I've encountered:  1) double-click on single for both left and right, rarely at the same time
66	neg	2) Mouse wheel gets stuck in a push (I barely use the mouse wheel as is, but seen it get stuck in the shift function)
66	neg	3) Mouse wheel keeps spinning after touch (basically, the weight is off and keeps spinning until it corrects where it thinks it wants to be, not where user places wheel)
66	neg	4) software updates requires a system reboot and locks all functionality until restarted
66	neg	Like I said, this used to be a great product and well produced
66	neg	If it was 1 out of 5 purchases, I could say maybe a manufacturing defect on that one device
66	neg	Unfortunately, it's been 5 out of 5 over the past two years; I seriously doubt it's a one time bad batch product issue
66	pos	Looking at other gaming mice for future enjoyment
66	neg	Dropping Logitech from future considerations
66	neg	Mouse rated for 50M clicks (per Logitech's website), no way I've hit that in 4 months
66	neg	50M clicks at 1 click per second would require me 578 days of straight clicking to hit
67	neg	I have a G502 on my PC, which I use for work
67	pos	I need different shortcuts on different software and so the G502 works perfectly and the user interface (which has been updated, but I haven’t replaced there) is easy to use
67	neg	Let’s start with the software: I installed it easily enough but it wouldn’t recognize the mouse
67	neg	Fine, restarted and it still wouldn’t, uninstalled and reinstalled and restarted before connecting: now it finally did
67	neg	Finally, after wasting my lunch and half an afternoon trying to figure it out, I managed to set it up
67	pos	Great
67	neg	Except scrolling was inverted and it would go up when I tried scrolling down and viceversa
67	neg	“Ok, I’ll fix that on settings” there was no option on settings, so I fixed that on Apple configuration
67	neg	Cue more time wasted on a solution I could not find
67	pos	Finally I gave up, willing to suck it up and enjoy my shortcuts that change from program to program, that would be dreamy, at least
67	neg	Except it wasn’t, because no sooner had I started enjoying them when they stopped working for no reason
67	neg	So it’s back to troubleshooting
67	neg	More wasted time, more restarts and more reinstalls and setups later and best I would get was a couple hours of work before shortcuts crapped out again
67	neg	I really wanted this to work so I asked for a replacement
67	neg	I ende up returning it as well
67	pos	Apple users: save your time and money
68	pos	I don't know how else to say it but this mouse is awesome especially if you have big hands like me
68	pos	I got this mouse as a replacement/holder until I got my corsair mouse back from a replacement I had to make due to a button failing on it (right click)
68	pos	I wanted something that had the same similar style with enough buttons for my MMO games and a thumb rest
68	pos	Instead I received a great quality mouse that felt better in my hand and even shocked me with its great remapping software
68	pos	The integrated games mapping is awesome
68	pos	Before I had to go into a game and find the mapping to make a profile on my mouse and remap that to whatever button I wanted
68	pos	With the Logitech software it scans the games and tells you exactly what mappings do what
68	pos	It's kind of hard to explain but it makes things so much easier
68	pos	Little things like that and the actual quality build of the mouse is why I'm switching from my 90$ mouse to a 40$ mouse as my go to
69	pos	tried as a replacement for my g9
69	pos	that was like fine, whatever
69	neg	and they don't all even fit into the base at once in a configuration that balances it properly
69	neg	like there's one configuration they fit as
69	neg	and they don't make other weights in that shape
69	neg	probably because it's a terrible shape
69	neg	anyway, so i'm replacing the microswitches in my g9 as the left click is doubling about 1/10,000 clicks under certain circumstances
70	pos	The mouse itself is fairly good, not great
70	neg	but the software (G Hub) Logitech pretty much forces you to use is atrocious
70	pos	I bought it to replace my aging Logitech G700s, which I really liked
70	pos	I prefer how the G700s felt in my hands to this, but that's probably just personal preference
70	pos	The DPI shift button (the button by the thumb) feels too far forward for me, but I probably just need to get used to it
70	neg	My main issue with the mouse itself is that I find myself accidentally clicking the left mouse button pretty often with the G502, so I think buttons are quite a bit lighter/easier to press on this mouse
70	neg	The thing that I really dislike the most about this mouse is  G Hub, the software Logitech pretty much forces you to use if you want to get the most out of the mouse
70	neg	LGS was also faster, used fewer system resources, and more intuitive than G Hub
70	neg	But it looks like Logitech won't let you use the old LGS software with this mouse anymore
70	neg	Overall, I'm pretty displeased with this mouse
70	pos	The only reason I bought it, is because it was on sale
70	neg	Had I known how bad G Hub was, I would have bought something else, even if it cost more
70	neg	My advice, either go with Corsair for a better product, or try Redragon if you want something cheap
71	pos	This is an absolutely fantastic right handed mouse
71	pos	I literally can't find anything else that feels as good as this does on my hand and wrist
71	neg	My mouse's left click started double clicking on every click about two months into ownership
71	pos	I would have given higher stars had their warranty process been useable
71	neg	I have attempted a warranty claim with the serial number on the mouse multiple times and never get an email back for an RMA
71	neg	Absolutely horrible, convoluted return process that is not meant to be useable (I truly think it's difficult on purpose
71	neg	) I love Logitech's G502, but this model isn't where it's at
72	pos	I ordered this to replace an old and worn out G700s, which was solidly built and only had one major issue with the double clicking
72	pos	This mouse even with the weights added feels very light, much lighter than the G700s
72	pos	It also feels incredibly cheap, especially the scroll wheel which feels very flimsy
72	neg	The scroll wheel is also annoyingly loud when not in frictionless mode
72	neg	It does not have a smooth clicking sound like the G700s, but sounds like its grinding
72	neg	Frictionless mode is really loose scrolling up and down pages, far more than a G700s
72	neg	Ergonomically its smaller than a G700s, sitting much lower and does not feel like any the older G-series mice, forcing me to uncomfortably extend my wrist
72	pos	It seems like it may be better suited for a child
72	neg	The other reviews make me question if I got the real thing
72	neg	Amazon can be like Russian roulette on hardware
72	neg	If this is a legit Logitech product, I am not happy
72	neg	I have bought Logitech gaming mice for over a decade and this is the first one where it felt cheap, was ergonomically off, and had a scroll wheel that sounded like it was grinding
72	neg	None of the others, I have bought several over the years, were like this
73	pos	First off, I'm biased
73	pos	I've been using the Proteus Core version for 2-3 years
73	pos	Bought back when they were in the $100 range
73	pos	Loved the mouse
73	pos	So naturally its hard not to go for the updated version for $41 since mine is getting ragged
73	pos	Saw that the special edition was $29 but not digging the black and white scheme
73	neg	Much rather have the all black and since that was the only difference, I paid the extra $12 for the regular version
73	neg	Honestly I really wanted to go to a the wireless G502 but since its literally a $110 up charge ($41 vs $149) for being cordless, theres no way
73	neg	Shame on you Logitech for being ridiculous in your cordless pricing
73	pos	I'm happy as every with my new G502 and should be for another 2-3 years I imagine
73	neg	**EDIT** 12/25/19Have to send this back for a replacement
73	neg	The mouse wheel buttons are defective
73	neg	If you press down on the middle mouse button it presses the left and right side wheel buttons as well (randomly)
73	neg	The left and right wheel buttons are ridiculously sensitive to the slightest touch
73	neg	They even get pressed when I'm just using the wheel and not meaning to press a button
73	pos	Really hoping this is a defect in this particular mouse and not a widespread problem with the new HERO line of the G502
73	pos	My old G502 has no issue with this whatsoever even after years of hard use
73	pos	**EDIT** 12/27/19First off, big ups to AMAZON for sending me a replacement so quickly
73	pos	Great customer service
73	neg	Bad news is it seems the issue I am having wasn't a one off problem
73	neg	You literally can't click the middle mouse button without clicking a left or right side wheel click simultaneously
73	pos	I hope I am explaining this right
73	neg	I bind all 11 mouse buttons for games and nearly every time I click the middle mouse, it clicks button 10 or 11 as well
73	neg	I've decided to keep the mouse because its still a great everyday driver but for a gaming mouse, I wouldn't recommended it if you like to use the middle mouse click
74	pos	Point is, in my many years of PC gaming (starting all the way back at Wolfenstein 3D) I have never been as impressed with a mouse as this one
74	pos	Let me start by saying how rock solid it is
74	pos	So that said…I’ve purchased this mouse twice, and I gotta say…
74	pos	I his mouse has taken physical abuse better than any gaming peripheral I’ve ever seen
74	pos	It even worked when mostly broken
74	pos	When it’s not broken it works fantastic as well
74	pos	Accurate, super customizable, wonderfully ergonomic if you have giant weight lifting meat claws like me
74	pos	They come in wireless and light versions too (it is a bit on the heavy side if you have string bean arms)
74	pos	Anyway, it only makes sense the 502 replace the MX518 as my favorite mouse
75	pos	Logitech has been a company I've used all my life
75	pos	They used to be top of their game
75	neg	This new mouse (logitech hero), developed the same issue in less then a couple months
75	neg	I gave it a try over the next several months trying everything to fix it
75	neg	I haven't reached out to logitech yet (will be doing so asap), but I do see the logitech forums plastered with people having these same problems, with no response from Logitech
75	neg	I would highly suggest that you check out all the options from other manufactures prior to buying a new mouse
76	pos	Like trying to drive a Ferrari GT to the grocery store
76	neg	Maybe professional gamers like or need 11 mouse functions but I found some to be in the way and have had to disable half of them
76	pos	The software is not intuitive, and seems to have a mind of its own
76	pos	Even though the new firmware recognized I had Destiny 2 and Division 2, the profiles seemed to only work part time
76	pos	I ended up having to set the default to a keybind layout that would work on both
76	pos	The Extremely high DPI gets in the way
76	pos	In the middle of a fight my mouse is suddenly all over the place and I find the DPI has shifted up to 10,000 or 12,000
76	pos	My DPI default is set to 2400 and the DPI shift button toggles it down to 1000
76	pos	Logitech makes great stuff, I have many other items
76	pos	This mouse is built well, solid and feels good
76	pos	Just way too much overkill
76	pos	Do you really need 5 different weights to be placed in the base
77	neg	I bought this mouse as a replacement for my M720 Triathlon, which I had used for about a year and a half before then
77	neg	When this mouse began showing the same symptoms, I was disheartened to say the least, especially so since the mouse was out of the return window, but less than a year old
77	neg	I looked into the issue deeper and found that the culprit was the Omron switches used inside the mouse, for the left and right click
77	neg	0 switches, so I decided to fix this mouse instead of buying a new one
77	pos	I bought four of the Kailh switches, and I and a friend replaced the old Omrons in both my G502 Hero and my M720 Triathlon, and now they both work flawlessly
77	neg	The cause of the double-click bug is due to a technical oversight in the switches longevity when in a newer, more power-conservative circuit, I was told
77	neg	If you can replace the switches, either by yourself or with some help, I can recommend this mouse, otherwise, expect to replace it within two years, most likely
77	neg	UPDATE: 9 Months InAfter a few months since my review, it is now April, and the Hyperscroll feature of the device stopped working abruptly
77	neg	I hadn't done anything to merit this, it simply quit
77	neg	When the paddle is engaged, it pushes the pin away from the scroll wheel, which allows the wheel to spin without clicking
77	neg	When disengaged, the pin is pushed against the scroll wheel, which causes the familiar click/bump of scrolling
77	neg	Since the spring has way too much tension for its purpose, it does do an excellent job at one thing: pushing the pin right out of place
77	neg	I can think of at least ten different ways to prevent this pin from sliding
77	neg	All of these issues have driven my rating of this device from 5 stars, to 4 stars, and now 2 stars
77	pos	I give the device 2 stars because, at the end of the day, it is user serviceable, and I like Logitech
77	neg	I've had good experiences with their products every single time I've bought them until now, and its very unfortunate that this is the first thing I've bought from them that has disappointed me
77	neg	I cannot recommend this mouse
78	neg	After 12 years, my MADCATZ mouse finally gave up the ghost, and I needed a replacement gaming mouse
78	pos	As my budget now is much more limited, and MADCATZ isn't what it used to be, I chose to go with this one based on reviews I had read online
78	pos	It has performed quite well, and with my large hands, the fit is pretty good
78	neg	The only issue I have had, as have others, is the middle wheel/button
78	neg	It is very easy to mis-click with it, and hit one of the side buttons when trying to click the center
78	neg	I highly recommend not using the center or wheel side buttons for anything essential in the game, as in the heat of a big battle, the odds of you hitting the wrong ability are pretty high
78	pos	The scroll function is good, and it's nice to be able to turn off the wheel clicker for free scrolling when I want
78	pos	I have found that to ensure the right button is hit, that I have to stretch my finger flat over the wheel to ensure that I get a true straight down motion
78	pos	With adjustment capability and a better middle button/scroll, this would be a 6 star mouse
78	pos	As for the rest, it integrates perfectly into my Logitech software for my G13 as well as any other Logitech hardware I may pick up in the future, and they work well together
78	pos	I have had no tracking issues, and as I use a rather large HD TV as a monitor, it was simple to adjust tracking for a comfortable fit to my large screen while still keeping fine control over game movement
78	pos	I don't regret buying and using this mouse
78	pos	I haven't had it very long, so I can't speak to longevity, but at this price point, I would be very surprised to get 12 years of heavy use out of it, though I do expect it to last a while, as I have had vey good experiences with Logitech hardware over the years
79	pos	I bought this mouse to replace another mouse that had lasted 5 years
79	pos	This mouse was purchased because I wanted a quality product that would last
79	neg	Turns out it did not last even 4 months before the left click started to double click and lose the sensor that is is being held down
79	neg	I click and drag a lot for work, and this is unacceptable that the mouse did not even make it a year
79	neg	Very disappointed in Logitech product quality for this price range
80	pos	There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately
80	pos	1) Daily useNot everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day
80	pos	The rest goes to programming, studying, etc
80	pos	So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs
80	pos	Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition
80	pos	Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option
80	pos	Well, for daily use I can list the following pros: 
80	pos	- Fits incredibly well around your hand 
80	pos	- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use  > Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc
80	pos	- Great grip 
80	pos	- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software Gaming
80	pos	When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode
80	pos	I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully
80	pos	Following pros: - You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's
80	pos	The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse
80	pos	- The buttons are programmable
80	pos	This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want
80	pos	Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer
80	pos	I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back
80	pos	With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer
80	pos	Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure
80	pos	(Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win
80	pos	The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage
80	pos	Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it
80	pos	Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference
80	pos	Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage
80	pos	I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much
80	pos	Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important
80	pos	So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show
80	pos	Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in
81	pos	This mouse is awesome for gaming and office work
81	pos	It is on the heavier side even without any weights inside the mouse
81	pos	I have bigger hands and my hand fits comfortably
81	pos	I do a ton of gaming with a side of office work with daily use and this mouse holds up for whatever task is thrown at it
81	pos	The software to control everything is great, but not perfect
81	pos	I like the accessibility you have with the software along with the hardware too
81	pos	The RGB is a nice touch
81	pos	I like that when you change your DPI you can quickly glance at the RGB lights to determine which one you're using
81	neg	I have 2 complaints and that is that the 2 buttons to the side of the left-click button are easy to click on accident
81	neg	It doesn't happen to me a lot, but it definitely does happen usually when I go to place my hand back on the mouse
81	neg	My second complaint is that the rubber grips get dirty and it is kind of hard to clean in my opinion because of the texture it has
81	pos	Great mouse overall
82	neg	Love this except for one flaw that is kinda bothering me
82	neg	I’ve rearranged the weights several times to try to fix, to no avail
82	neg	But my screen will still zoom in or move around as if I was still moving it
82	neg	And I’ve made the sure wheel is not moving, nothing is moving
82	neg	But it continues to do this day after day on at least two of my games
82	neg	Also just realized (when I was on Logitech's site looking at possible ways to fix this) that the mouse is supposed to light up on the side piece as well, not just the Logitech symbol
82	neg	So this makes me wonder now if I DO in fact have a defective product
82	neg	I'll give it a go for a couple more days, but if the scrolling issue doesn't get resolved, I'll be sending it back
82	pos	Otherwise this mouse is awesome
82	neg	That’s the only reason for the 3 stars
82	pos	The mouse fits comfortably to my hand, feels great, and has great response times
82	neg	**Update** I have sent this back
82	neg	The lights on the side randomly come on
82	neg	The zooming got a little better once I locked the wheel, but part of the reason for having it was the free spinning
82	neg	I’m going to get another one and cross my fingers**2nd Update** instead of getting another wired version, I went ahead and got the wireless
82	pos	Same design and after using it for a week, I’m completely in love
83	neg	Overall, this would be a 4 or 5 star product out of the box, but it seems like, over time, nearly 100% of these mice eventually develop a faulty sensor for either the left or right mouse button
83	neg	In simple terms, when holding down the mouse button (right, in my case) the button will electrically release and reclick, despite being physically held down with constant pressure
83	neg	For some games, this may not even noticeable, but for others it can render the game unplayable
83	neg	From what I've read online (could be completely wrong, I'm not an expert) the switches logitech uses are relatively cheap Chinese-made switches not ideal for operating at the low voltages this mouse outputs
83	neg	What happens is the switches develop a static charge that resists voltage potential and can interrupt current flowing through the sensor
83	pos	A quick fix is to lightly blow under the faulty mouse button - the moisture in your breath helps dissipate excess charge built up on the switch, and this will temporarily fix the button
83	neg	Unfortunately it's a short lived fix and has diminishing returns over time - at first the problem wouldn't return for months, now I have to do this once per day
83	neg	Really annoying and unfortunately the problem developed just a few days outside the 1 year warranty window, so I replaced it with a Razer Viper Ultimate and I'm much happier with it than the G502
84	pos	I bought the original (non-Hero) G502 about 5 years ago and loved it
84	pos	I bought this mouse as a backup and just opened it up about a month ago when the scroll wheel of my original got a piece of dust stuck in it and would center click as I scrolled
84	pos	I've since got the piece out and it works fine again though
84	pos	I have larger hands and this mouse is a little longer than others I've tried so it fits me really well
84	pos	I love the freewheel scroll feature
84	pos	I don't think I will be able to go back to a mouse without that after using this thing
84	pos	This mouse has just about everything I could ask for
84	pos	Different profiles, on the fly sensitivity changes, plenty of buttons, customizable RGB
84	pos	Its a fairly heavy mouse even without the weights
84	pos	I have left the weights out completely of both of my mice
84	pos	I would say it is fairly durable
84	pos	I have 2 younger children and my original G502 has held up to years of their abuse and I'm sure the new one will as well
84	pos	At $37, I will probably be buying a 3rd one just to keep as a backup
85	neg	If I had to buy it over again based on the mouse alone I wouldn't
85	neg	Ergonomically, it feels bulky and a bit awkward
85	neg	Ive tinkered with it for a few weeks now and still cant get it to to start with the computer
85	neg	It still periodically freezes and requires a re-install to get it working again
85	neg	Google "LG hub error" and make your decision based off those results
85	pos	If the software's going to be integral it should be light, precise and stable
85	neg	It is none of those things
85	neg	3/19/21 update: Now Logitech Ghub sporadically switches profiles
85	neg	More errors
85	neg	Google results show many with the same issue
85	neg	Running this on a 2020 RTX laptop, so hardware compatibility should not be an issue
85	neg	Downgraded to 1 star because I am no longer using the mouse due to software issues
86	neg	I have large hands and it is just a touch small for me
86	pos	The scroll wheel seems to be a bit too sensitive, although that might be due to some software glitch that the last Windows update caused
86	neg	You can't turn the RGB off but you can set it to one colour and not have it flashing
87	pos	I bought this mouse to replace a very disappointing Corsair mouse of similar design that finally wore out
87	pos	I can say that this mouse stands up next to the Corsair counterparts reasonably well albeit with a bit less "flair"
87	pos	I found the feel and movement to be comparable and the DPI setting ranges are equal if not a bit better in this case
87	neg	The one drawback I've found is the scroll wheel
87	pos	You have two options: rock hard or complete freewheel
87	pos	After using it for a few weeks I determined that the "rock hard" setting became tiresome when scrolling through webpages and that the freewheel setting enabled quick scrolling
87	neg	However, when in freewheel, the wheel has a terrible tendency to have backlash, most likely due to the sensor design
87	neg	I found the left-right scroll doesn't work with all programs either (Excel being one), which was also a disappointment
87	neg	Another recent discovery is that, like the Corsair I had previously, recent updates to their software can cause severe system crashes, which has led me to disable updating altogether
87	neg	Attempts to alert the company to this issue met with a canned response, leading me to believe they're not too concerned about the quality of their driver software, which is unfortunate
87	neg	This would be a five-star mouse if the scroll wheel was improved and if we didn't have to worry about a driver software update completely breaking our systems without warning
88	neg	The media could not be loaded
88	neg	For the first year this mouse was truly fantastic, would have whole-heartedly given it 5 stars, however after only a single year I have encountered a problem that renders the mouse nigh unusable
88	neg	After only a single year, the primary button, m1, suffers from severe stuttering and unreliable response from user inputs
88	neg	It is utterly ridiculous for a mouse at this price point to suffer from a hardware flaw like this so soon, and apparently it is a common issue with many other logitech brand mice
88	neg	This is  made increasingly more aggravating by attempting to fight your way through their site with a busted mouse
88	neg	Needless to say I am very disappointed in my purchase and will be avoiding Logitech for any future hardware needs
89	neg	This mouse is a major disappointment
89	neg	The biggest problem is a defective left-click button
89	neg	The button operates randomly and can take anywhere from 1 to 4 clicks to open a program
89	neg	When I went online to see if the defect was solvable, there were 100s of “Logitech Mouse Button Click Problems” hits
89	neg	Given the button defect, the mouse is being returned
89	neg	The “user documentation” that came with the mouse was limited to a few small stick figures with text so small that I had to pull out a magnifying glass to read it
90	neg	Just holding this mouse makes my wrist cramp, it forces a claw-grip with your pinky and ring finger to hold the mouse and is extremely uncomfortable when you have to grip it hard
90	neg	The Software (G Hub) is required, and has to be RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND at all times in order for 90% of the mouse's features to work
90	neg	The mouse claims to have on-board memory but NONE of the settings can be customized with it, you can only use pre-made profiles which all suck
90	neg	So if you want to change DPI, Polling Rate, or any of the button functions, you need G Hub running at all times
90	neg	In my task manager right now there are 6 different G Hub
90	neg	exes using up a total of 246 CPU threads, and an absurd 300mb of RAM
90	neg	If the mouse had working on-board memory this wouldn't even be worth mentioning, but it doesn't, so it is
90	neg	Coming from a G700 (another Logitech mouse) I thought this mouse would be an upgrade, little did I know that my 7 year old mouse was leaps and bounds ahead of this modern brick
91	neg	The issue was that the left click was no longer working as intended
91	neg	I was not able to click and drag anything and would occasionally register a double click
91	pos	Apparently this is a common issue, but at the price, I just couldn't find another mouse that could compete
91	pos	At the price, it's reasonable, I just wish if it was such a common issue, for it to have been fixed already especially since it's one of their more popular gaming mouse
91	pos	Since then, I've also purchased a MX Master 3 and use them side by side depending on my uses
91	pos	It's still one of the better gaming mouse out there, especially for the price
92	pos	To fully take advantage of this mouse's precision, go to the mouse settings on Windows, set it to the slowest setting, then go into the Logitech software and up the DPI
92	pos	This will give you the most precise tracking you can get from the mouse
92	neg	A lost of people seem to just use a lower DPI in the mouse software and wonder why with small movements, the mouse becomes jumpy
92	pos	Set up your software correctly
92	pos	The other way round, you would have to go into game and/or Windows settings to make those changes
92	neg	However, I didn't want to break the bank after spending over $200 for a wireless low latency setup on my gaming PC
92	pos	This mouse has all that for less than $50 with the only limitation that it is wired
92	pos	I love heavier mice and this one has weights
92	pos	Surely a Plus as well for me
93	neg	if you want a great gaming mouse that remembers your settings, this is NOT what you're looking for
93	pos	all the other positive reviews about the features, buttons, button sets, etc
93	pos	this has the potential to be SUCH a great mouse
93	neg	but *EVERY* time it does an update to its software (which is at least once a week) it WIPES OUT all your settings
93	neg	so you have to go back through and ONE BY ONE put each setting back on each button
93	neg	sometimes 3 times a week
93	neg	logitech has confirmed this is the EXPECTED behavior
93	neg	they expect YOu to export your settings to the cloud, and then reimport EVERY time it updates
93	neg	so i turned off auto updates
93	neg	IT AUTO UPDATES ANYWAY
93	neg	it COMPLETELY ignores your settings to not update
93	neg	this behavior exists on both mac and pc
94	pos	The sensor is this mouse is legit, one of the best I’ve ever come across and I’ve used a lot of gaming mice in my life
94	pos	From Razer to Alienware, this one competes with the best of them
94	pos	The adjustable weights are also a plus
94	pos	The extra buttons are also a big plus
94	pos	It has a couple and they can be very useful
94	neg	The only downside I can think of is the mouse itself is rather a bit small for my taste and I think it could use a pinky support but I do have large hands so perhaps it isn’t applicable for everyone
94	neg	Also while it does have many extra buttons, the thumb one is awkwardly positioned right under the thumb so I frequently press it by mistake
94	neg	The two index finger buttons next to left click are also a bit inconvenient because one would have to move the index finger off the important left click to use them
94	pos	Conclusion: I got it on sale for $39
94	pos	99 and for the price it’s a fantastic deal
95	pos	Once I got it configured for a particular game, it's actually improved my playing because of the multi-button functionality
95	pos	Nothing can replace the multi-gesture functionality of Apple's Magic Mouse surface, but this is fully in use now and I really enjoy it
95	pos	It feels very solid and slides effortlessly
95	pos	I have a small hand that has no trouble reaching all the buttons and features, and its response rate is fantastic
96	neg	Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great
96	neg	Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse
96	neg	The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached
96	neg	I saw another review with a similar complaint
96	neg	It's apparently an issue
96	neg	Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb
96	neg	The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far
96	neg	That button is way to far forward
96	pos	This thing feels really cheap
96	neg	The buttons are super flimsy
96	neg	I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it
96	neg	I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid
96	pos	Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap
96	neg	Had I paid full price, I would be returning it
96	pos	Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more
96	neg	No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though
96	neg	Update:Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues
96	neg	First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse
96	pos	Which is fine
96	neg	Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better
96	neg	First, it wants to do a firmware update
96	neg	If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in
96	pos	That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software
96	pos	You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays
96	pos	When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing
96	neg	Yet, it won't be doing it
96	neg	For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default
96	neg	So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there
96	pos	The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time
96	neg	But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights
96	neg	Instead you have to click on the main "Settings" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time
96	neg	I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this
96	neg	I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb
96	pos	That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI
96	neg	With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way
96	pos	As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly
96	pos	I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice
96	neg	Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed
96	pos	Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy
96	pos	Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out
96	pos	Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture
96	pos	Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world
96	neg	Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel
96	pos	There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth
96	neg	Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars
96	pos	I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though
96	pos	It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box
96	pos	And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well
96	pos	I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well
96	pos	Still braided, but way more flexible
96	pos	Hopefully it holds up as well
97	pos	First is the design:The design, while unusual, works fairly well
97	pos	I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons
97	neg	Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it
97	neg	It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do
97	neg	The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed
97	neg	It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons
97	pos	Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button)
97	pos	As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable
97	pos	If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB
97	neg	The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games
97	pos	Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it
97	neg	Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you
97	neg	It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind
97	pos	All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it
97	pos	G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded
97	pos	Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well
97	pos	Third is the delivery:It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area
97	pos	I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive
97	pos	As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time
97	pos	If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far
97	pos	But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly
98	pos	This is a fantastic mouse
98	pos	The buttons and even the scroll wheel are PERFECTLY clicky
98	pos	If you don't like that, the scroll wheel "click" can be turned off with the button directly under it, so it free spins
98	pos	You can also download it's user interface where you can download other users set-ups for specific games, etc
98	pos	and can built your own, along with setting up the "G" logo color palette
98	pos	The color vibrance and transition is so smooth and bright looking, I actually left it rainbow (my pics did not at all do the colors justice)
98	pos	The sides are rubberized, which provides excellent control for button use
98	pos	The bottom is slighlt gridded for friction & the wire is covered in woven nylon & runs about 6 ft
98	pos	Oh, and it comes with a 5 pack of weights in their own case
98	pos	I couldn't be happier with this mouse
99	pos	I upgraded from Razer Basilisk (wired) and I would say, it is an upgrade
99	pos	Way better/more customization option, buttons clicks really good and overall build quality is awesome despite the cost of this mouse just being 40$
99	pos	Little plastic container contains multiple weights to weigh down your mouse is a surprise for me
99	pos	Those thing fits under discretely
99	neg	Placement sucks
99	pos	If it was placed differently or had stiffer click to prevent accidents, then I wouldn't have any issues
99	pos	"But you can turn them off
99	pos	Other than that issue, overall mouse is really good
99	pos	Like, actually good
100	pos	The weights are good but standard
100	pos	The resolution as expected
100	pos	Button presses require very little force (I would bet the switches would be the first things to fail)
100	neg	Update few months later: docked two stars, left button has developed switch bounce and now sometimes clicks multiple times with one press of the button
100	pos	Update months laterer: Oh man, you're gonna love this
100	neg	Button got worse (couldn't even drag anything; real fun playing the "which folder did the file get dropped into
100	neg	" game) then the right button started to display similar issues
100	neg	It took me a month or two to actually get the warranty process started and it's a huge hassle
100	pos	They didn't ask for that, however; instead, they asked for all of my details and sent me a new one
100	pos	So, in summary:- they replaced defective product and I love being able to drag files or select text again, that's one (1) shiny gold star for Logitech added
100	neg	That's right, the expensive (well
101	pos	Generally, you hear a lot of good things about Logitech mice, but this one might possibly be the best one from them
101	pos	Between being able to customize the other buttons on your mouse, on top of your DPI, but it also has an unlockable mouse wheel
101	pos	Scrolling through a big inventory, or a long thread online
101	pos	The wheel itself is comfortable, and really sturdy when you're clicking, or even scrolling
101	pos	The other buttons don't get in the way of your clicks, and the wheel lock is completely out of the way when you're using it
101	neg	The only (probably personal) issue I have so far is, my mouse does glitch out, and moves either in one direction, or spasms
101	neg	I don't have any dust, nor debris on my mouth, so I'm unsure if I have a faulty mouse, or it could be one of those model-specific issues
101	pos	Regardless of that, this is a really nice mouse for its price
101	pos	The firmware is great (not needed), the mouse is comfortable, and if you're a fan of weighted mice like I am, it has a sizeable, adjustable weight you can fit inside
102	neg	Have gone through two of these mice already and same issue both times
102	neg	After about a year the mouse will cause the camera to look straight up and the M2 (right click) button completely gives out
102	neg	Good luck playing any FPS game without rage quitting when this inevitably occurs
102	neg	Its disappointing because brand new, the G520 Hero is a great gaming mouse
102	pos	It fits nicely in the hand, has adjustable weights, and the perfect number of buttons for most gaming styles
102	neg	Would love to purchase another but can not justify throwing more money at Logitech for a product I know will fail within a year
103	neg	Both are having typical left click failures, so I wanted something heavy with a larger footprint like the M65
103	pos	Logitech got a lot right with this design, which is why I'm not surprised it hasn't changed much over the years
103	pos	The ability to add weights is a huge plus for me since I love a large, heavy mouse for some weird reason
103	pos	The magnetic flap is one of my favorite design choices as well - it's dead simple and honestly really cool
103	pos	The scroll wheel is solid and tactile, and provides a rewarding click when using
103	pos	With the scroll button disengaged, the scroll wheel is buttery smoooooth
103	pos	I definitely dig it, especially because this mouse pulls double-duty between my gaming PC and my work laptop
103	neg	I think this issue is mainly on me, though
103	pos	I change up my grips periodically, so it's really just acclimatizing to the mouse at this point
103	pos	Overall, I really dig the G502
103	pos	I've always avoided Logitech products because of their "office" products, but this mouse has definitely exceeded my expectations so far
103	pos	Since I'm still breaking it in, I'll probably update this review if it starts doing anything wonky
104	neg	I am having tracking issues with mine
104	neg	It's mainly my table to blame, but my Razor mouse don't have a problem with my desk and mouse pad
104	neg	So this mouse not taking a liking to this and thus not working out for me
104	neg	But when using it, you can feel it hang on something and stop moving for a sec
104	pos	My Razor mouse does not have any issue
104	pos	You can glide my Razor mouse across gravel and it still make head shots
104	neg	But this mouse not working for me
105	neg	Two issues immediately stood out
105	neg	It probably wouldn't be a huge deal in the long run, but I noticed the difference in ergonomics right away
105	neg	The G502 scrollwheel has a slick metal surface that's almost slippery, and a LOUD clicking in step-mode
105	pos	The button for switching to smooth scrolling is a nice feature, but in step mode it's just too clunky
106	neg	This g502 Logitech Hero hasn't even lasted me two years
106	neg	I was waiting to review this for this purpose
106	neg	I'm now back to using the thrift store mouse because the g502 Hero is no longer functioning
106	pos	The upside: The mouse feels nice and glides effortlessly across most surfaces
106	pos	It is comfortable
106	neg	Glider Wheel broke several months in
106	neg	Again, the right click stopped working
106	neg	It still clicks, I can feel it, I can hear it, but the mouse doesn't react
106	neg	I disassembled, cleaned, reassembled and still nothing
106	neg	Unreliable DPI stability feature
106	neg	Sometimes my DPI will drop well below acceptable usability, then recover on its own
106	neg	The entire software setup, this gHub or whatever, is absolute garbage
106	neg	It is a convoluted mess requiring so much more work than is necessary to use
106	neg	It crashes for no reason despite updates, does not save profiles, does not let you utilize macros, is not user friendly, and requires manual startup
106	neg	If you click to open it, it just sits on the "Update" screen indefinitely
106	neg	There are too many other things I want to say about this product, but overall, and being a lifelong fan of Logitech, I'm more than disappointed
106	neg	I won't be using their "gaming" mice ever again
107	neg	Someone said this is too heavy
107	pos	I don't think it is
107	pos	It's lighter than my old gaming mouse that broke
107	neg	It has too many buttons and some are near the primary ones
107	neg	You have to be careful how you hold your hand or you find yourself changing your sensitivity by accident
107	neg	G-Hub did not work on Win 7 for me, and there's no Linux support
107	neg	You will need Windows 8+ to configure it
107	neg	I feel we're going backwards in technology and user experience here
108	pos	It was comfortable to use so I never put much thought into it
108	pos	And holy cow is this an awesome mouse
108	pos	The customization features in the Logitech Software alone is super easy to use and make adjustments for later
108	pos	Set different levels of sensitivity for my needs, set up the extra mouse buttons for different purposes in different games
108	pos	Console gamers looking to dive into PC, give this mouse a shot, it has enough customization options to fit just about anyone’s needs
109	pos	I have/was a Razer fanboy for years
109	neg	Unfortunately razer products have started to go downhill & any support has become virtually laughable if best
109	pos	This isn't a crap on razer review but more a "thank god I found an alternative"
109	pos	When switching from my 3rd razer death adder to my first logitech G502, I immediately felt "comfortable"
109	pos	Added weights gave me the feel I wanted
109	pos	The ergonomics felt right, & the mouse overall just WORKED
109	pos	I am a huge fan if the scroll wheel now also & the fact that you can set it to both standard & infinite scroll is a nice touch
109	pos	Been several months now & I think it's time I make the complete jump for the rest of my products
109	neg	Not something you want while gaming
110	pos	This is an extremely precise and reliable mouse, both with movement and scroll wheel
110	neg	The only annoying thing about it is the non-adjustable "thunk" of the scroll wheel, it's too "notchy"
110	neg	- if you engage it, the scroll wheel has a super annoying "thunk" every time you turn the mouse wheel
110	pos	In the end, I went with the razer basilisk -> extremely precise, scroll wheel sensitivity can be adjusted with a knob under the mouse (no software needed
110	neg	- I hate having to install mouse/keyboard software, for any reason)
111	pos	Buttons: It has enough buttons to assign several functions to them in games without going overboard
111	pos	I really wanted a mouse with extra buttons directly adjacent to the M1 or M2 button like the g300s had and this one has two next to the M1 button and a couple of thumb buttons
111	pos	Weight: Medium to heavy depending on weights added
111	pos	There is a hinged magnetic "door" on the bottom of the mouse that makes it extremely easy to adjust the weight of the mouse on a whim
111	neg	My g300s was ultra lightweight, which made flick shots extremely easy but glidey tracking wasn't perfectly smooth
111	pos	This one glides extremely well and flicks well with the weights taken out
111	pos	Adding too much weight can cause overshoot or a kind of rubber banding effect when I throw my hand quickly, but more weight feels like it has easier gliding and tracking
111	pos	It does have a scroll wheel lock and unlock button that lets you choose between the clicky single line scrolling or the friction free high speed scrolling, which I change all the time as needed
111	pos	Software: Let's you change your lights, button assignments, make macros, etc
111	neg	Cons: The only minor con is that the scroll wheel very slightly jiggles when flicking the mouse quickly
111	pos	It has never caused me problems, but I can feel it when it happens
111	pos	The jiggle was nearly eliminated and the friction free scrolling still works fine
112	pos	I really wanted to love this mouse
112	pos	I am a casual gamer, and I thought this would up my game a bit with precision and programmable buttons, etc
112	neg	Sadly, after using it for an afternoon, I found to be a poor choice for me
112	pos	Pros:-The smoothness of the sensing is excellent
112	pos	I felt my ability to pick precise targets in shooting scenarios would be enhanced compared to my old Microsoft mouse
112	pos	-The ability to switch the scroll button to free-wheeling is handy and satisfying
112	pos	-Materials do seem to be nice and solid
112	pos	-The weights are a nice touch for customizability
112	pos	-The lights add visual appeal without being too flashy
112	pos	Colors are customizeable
112	pos	-The quantity of buttons available is good, and their locations are easily accessible by fingers without accidental touches just from gripping the mouse itself
112	pos	-The sliding surfaces on the bottom are smooth and large
112	pos	-The feel in my larger than average hands was nice
112	pos	Ergonomics were good compared to a more standard shape
112	pos	-The thumb button for engaging low DPI would be good if I could get used to it
112	pos	-The multiple profiles available for single or multiple customized DPI & programmed button settings is nice
112	neg	Cons:-There's too much resistance on the scroll wheel when free-wheeling is disengaged
112	neg	When my fingers were dry, they would actually slip on the metal wheel surface instead of rolling it
112	neg	-The left/right bump buttons on the scroll wheel are easy to press, but the center scroll button is hard to press
112	neg	I found it very difficult to consistently press only the center scroll button
112	neg	Most of the time I was accidentally pressing down and left or right at the same time
112	neg	I found this highly annoying, and it made it harder for me to hit targets
113	neg	The left click works when it wants too
113	neg	I play FPS shooters and much other games, but the clicks have been giving me issues
113	neg	I would've returned it but its been sometime
113	neg	Not sure if I would get another Logitech mouse as I've been let down twice already
113	neg	The other products they make are great but the mice in my experience are terrible
114	pos	I’ve had good luck with Logitech products in the past so I figured this mouse would be decent
114	neg	It would randomly drag itself across the screen and freeze and I’d have to unplug and re-plug-in the mouse to my computer in order for it to start up again
114	neg	Super annoying after the first two or three times and it began doing it more often as time went on
114	neg	I thought it was a computer issue but it did the same thing on other devices
114	pos	I ended up getting a different mouse recently
114	neg	This one is not worth buying
115	neg	LET ME EXPLAIN:To start, the Hand-Feel for me is really bad, and I usually end up holding it in a way that makes reaching two of the Thumb buttons very awkward
115	neg	But that's not what makes the G502 the worst mouse I've touched in over a decade
115	neg	NEGATIVES:What is NOT my fault is the overly sensitive Click Pressure on all the face and side buttons
115	neg	I don't know if that's an intended feature, or I just got mouse from a lot that was over-tuned
115	neg	But it's far too easy to accidentally click when sliding the mouse across the pad
115	neg	ANY resistance from your surface and CLICK
115	neg	Glance any part of a button that isn't the exact center: CLICK
115	neg	MORE NEGATIVES:The Mouse Wheel has to be some cruel experiment in psychological warfare
115	neg	The Lock/Unlock implementation warrants detailed comment in both states
115	neg	* As a free spinning wheel, it fails due to floatiness
115	neg	* As a tick wheel, it FAILS because the ratchet is far too loose to be trusted
115	neg	You get this awful effect where physically, the wheel will "back rock" or fore rock" to cradle itself between the teeth
115	neg	This then causes your scroll selection to tick up or down onto something other than your intent
115	neg	But enough (and unpredictably so) to seriously impede, if not, ruin whatever gaming moment you might have been having
115	neg	Further exacerbating the issue is you cannot change the internal DPI of the mouse wheel sensor
115	neg	You can only change how your Operating System MULTIPLIES the Wheel Motion
115	neg	And even with a 1:1 multiple, you get that selection rocking issue
115	pos	This would be an absolutely great mouse to lend to your competition
115	neg	I want to rip the wheel out of the mouse with my teeth and grind it until my gums bleed
115	pos	It's rare that I'm passionate at all about a design feature
115	neg	But this wheel, I HATE IT
115	neg	I want the person who designed it to feel as bad about making it, as I do trying to use it
115	neg	NEVER REVISIT THIS DESIGN EVER AGAIN
115	neg	You just don't get it
115	neg	It literally adds a layer of anxiety and distrust to EVERY SINGLE THING done with this mouse
115	neg	Even the tasks that have nothing to do with scrolling at all
115	neg	It doesn't even have the common courtesy to make a satisfying noise
115	pos	POSITIVES:The software is actually fairly good
115	neg	I genuinely tried "Getting Used to It"
115	neg	But as a result, I can no longer return it
115	pos	All these things have mechanically solid examples in your other products
115	pos	I purchased this mouse via a recommendation from a friend
115	neg	So yeah, 5-Stars if you just want an overpriced 2-button Mouse
116	pos	Packaging and shipping was excellent
116	neg	I had to give this mouse away though because it is just too large and uncomfortable for my hand size
116	neg	I also would prefer more buttons
116	neg	Size :I found the back of my hands hurting after using the mouse
116	neg	The "hump" or curve of the mouse seems high, making it a reach for the far left side button (default aim)
116	neg	This means I likely would not use it, bringing the amount of extra buttons down (at least for me)
116	pos	Although, my fingers did seem to automatically find the perfectly located middle back button
116	pos	I never once hit the front middle accidentally
116	pos	To be clear, those four and the middle back buttons are perfectly located so this is just me
116	pos	This is cool but I felt it would have been better with more noticeable feedback like a soft click
116	neg	The wheel felt almost loose and I am curious if I would have ended up mistakenly clicking to the left or right while trying to just middle click
116	neg	I honestly think I wouldnt and it's just a matter of the user to get used to it
116	pos	Overall, a cool looking and good quality mouse with a few expertly placed buttons
117	pos	FIrst of all the good things, it's of good quality construction and fits extremely well in my hand
117	pos	It slides fairly smoothly over my mouse pad and overall it's a pleasure to use
117	neg	It is not compatible with Logitech Gaming Software and instead needs to be used with G-HUB in order to customize it's settings
117	neg	G-HUB prevents the left/right wheel click from continuous horizontal scrolling like I could with the G502 Spectrum on LGS
117	neg	You can create a custom profile and then assign it to one of the 5 memory slots, but custom key assignments are for some reason not saved and/or applied
117	neg	Honestly I wish I could just get my money back
118	neg	It's got average ergonomics, above average buttons and placement, but is spoiled by the terrible Logitech GHub software
118	neg	This mouse doesn't have any onboard memory, which means the Logitech software *has* to be running at all times for you to use anything but the basic functions
118	neg	it will), you immediately lose any functions you've set on those extra keys until you reopen the software
118	neg	The interface is poorly designed, and I've yet to have it detect different games when they run on my PC
118	neg	The Mac software has even reset itself a couple times in the 3 weeks I've had it, meaning I have to go back and remap everything, reset the mouse speed, etc
118	neg	Also beware, Little Snitch shows that the G Hub software does phone home to Logitech
118	neg	You can't be sure what it's sending back and forth, especially when you're required to give it full access to your machine for it to function
118	neg	To cap it off, Logitech has *specifically* designed the extra buttons on this mouse so that they cannot be detected by any software other than G Hub
118	neg	To be clear, that is a deliberate design choice by Logitech to lock you in to their awful software
119	pos	My favorite aspect of the mouse is the adjustable weight
119	pos	i like my mouse to be heavier and i was pleasantly surprised that it came with quite a bit of weight i could add to it and make it the perfect weight
119	pos	The RGB lighting customization for the mouse is great and the software is super easy to use and that's where you can set your custom DPI and use the button on the mouse to quickly switch between the settings
119	neg	The one thing I don't like about the mouse that I've gotten used to is the size, my hand dwarfs this mouse
119	pos	Don't get me wrong its a decent size mouse but i have rather large hands so it was an adjustment but now after about 2 months of using it it feels natural and works great
119	pos	I would recommend this mouse to someone who is looking for a good FPS mouse that wont break the bank
119	neg	Fast forward 9 months the thing quit working
119	neg	Took it apart and the right click switch metal piece had broke and won't work anymore
119	neg	That little metal piece bricked the whole mouse
120	neg	I bought this mouse knowing about the double clicking problems plaguing Logitech mice
120	neg	Whether I come to regret this remains to be seen
120	neg	That said, I purchased the protection plan since everything I have heard about this mouse lead me to believe that it will fail within a few years
120	pos	I'm not terribly keen on the shape of the mouse, but I'm getting used to it
120	neg	I don't like the nylon braiding on the wire
120	pos	I liked the cloth braided wires on older mice better
120	pos	The customization software is fairly simple, but some features are easier to adjust than others
120	pos	5-5 star product, but knowing how widespread they are I'm giving this a 4 star rating instead
120	pos	This review is based on my experience so far
120	pos	If the mouse fails I will return and revise this review along with information on the RMA process
121	neg	Really regret buying this mouse, should have stuck with Corsair
121	pos	It's a great mouse, a 5-star mouse, except for how loud the scroll wheel is
121	pos	Hoping it'll get quieter over time because it really is a great mouse otherwise
121	neg	Just so, so, so very loud
121	pos	If you're only looking for hyper scroll the noise wouldn't be an issue at all
122	pos	I think if you had smaller hands or likes a thinner and low profile mouse this is perfect
122	pos	I like this mouse alot just wish they had an XL version
122	pos	BTW, the mouse wheel does not break it has a button to click rotate or free fly
123	neg	This for MSRP of $80 is ridiculous
123	neg	Usually go Logitech, but it's time to try other miceEDIT: I thought I was going crazy, but my mouse has begun to drift on its own
123	neg	It's been getting worse and worse
123	neg	I don't even use this for gaming really so the durability is questionable
123	pos	I love the G602 and, besides the wireless version of the G502, the G502 wired is the closest thing to the G602
123	pos	The mouse clicks feel nice and sound quiet just like the G602
123	pos	The build quality is great and it doesn't feel cheap
123	neg	However, my biggest complaint about this mouse is that it does not have the same amount programmable buttons the G602 had
123	neg	It's a step backwards from the G602 in this regard and it would be amazing if more buttons were positioned on the left side of the mouse like the G602
124	neg	tl;dr: I have big hands, the mouse is too tapered for my palm grip and is uncomfortable
124	pos	This mouse is better for claw grips
124	pos	I bought this to replace my Razer Death Adder which is far more comfortable
124	neg	I don't want that much momentum when I flick that wheel around
124	pos	I do like the idea of tilting the wheel, cool feature
125	neg	CONS- Software is very glitchy and bloated
125	neg	Takes up a lot of memory just to assign a few buttons
125	neg	Sometimes the button assigns just reset to factory after a while
125	neg	Had to reinstall it
125	neg	-The mouse wheel is one of those free-spinning ones that you can either spin like a fidget spinner or lock into a more traditional motion
125	neg	After two months of web-browsing use, the scrolling action no longer registers accurately
125	neg	Clicking with the wheel works, but scrolling up and down has about a 20% success rate
126	pos	I am using a good quality black neoprene mouse pad with a clean surface
126	neg	I found a tip online to uninstall the virtual mouse driver and reboot, this seems to have worked for a few hours but now the problems are back again
127	pos	I've used Logitech Mice for several years now
127	pos	I lost my old Logitech Mouse in my move to another state and I needed a replacement I bought the wireless lightspeed mouse
127	neg	It started having double clicking issues, and I ended up chucking it
127	pos	I decided to go with the standard wired mouse, and I saw the Logitech G502 Gaming mouse with the hero sensor
127	pos	It was cheap so I bought it
127	pos	All I will say is thank goodness it was cheap
127	pos	What I love about the mouse is the number of buttons you have and how it feels
127	pos	I like heavy mice and it comes with adjustable weights
127	pos	I also like how I'm able to customize the mouse to how I play my games with the software
127	pos	I feel it's just more user-friendly
127	pos	I also like the "Free" mouse scrolling wheel
127	pos	Overall the mouse looks and feels good, and the price was wallet-friendly
127	neg	NOW, we get to the major issue
127	neg	Both this mouse and the light-speed wireless one I have before it ended up having double-clicking issues
127	neg	I've tried cleaning it, adjusting my mouse double-clicking speed, but to no avail
127	neg	I'm so tired of Logitech and how cheap their mice are built
127	neg	It's a crying shame too because I think the mouse is great for gaming, but that stupid double click issue is not being resolved
127	neg	This will probably be the last Logitech Gaming mouse I buy until they do a better job with making them and fixing the double-clicking issue
128	pos	It's fast, it's comfortable, and it looks nice
128	neg	The free wheel, while quiet, is annoying as all heck - while a great idea, it just doesn't work practically when in a game or document
128	neg	lol The mechanical resistance scroll is really loud and difficult to move
128	neg	So you basically choose between an uncontrollable infinite scroll or a "stuck" mouse wheel
128	neg	But it's so loud
128	neg	So damn loud
128	neg	I wanted a mouse that was quieter than my last one, but this one was louder
128	pos	While this mouse has great DPI, it's hard to click and therefore reduces your time to react
128	neg	Would not recommend for an FPS
128	neg	I tried it in Destiny 2, and the thing just was ridiculously slow
128	neg	However, it's a very comfortable mouse
128	pos	The design is high quality and very well made
128	neg	Average mouse, not worth the price
129	pos	This is the second time I've bought this exact mouse
129	pos	My first one lasted about five years, so there's definitely something to be said for durability
129	pos	The removable weights are very nice, too (I prefer all of them to be in)
129	pos	It has a very satisfying click and the wheel can either be smooth or lightly clicky
129	pos	You can also adjust your pointer speed directly on the mouse, which I adore
129	pos	The cord is long and has a fabric covering
129	neg	There's a wireless version, but those irritate me
129	pos	It also moves very smoothly on the mousepad and works great with super fast pointer speed
129	pos	Very customizable in the Logitech app, as well
130	pos	The shape and feel of the mouse is nice, and comfortable for people with larger hands
130	pos	The custom button placements are better than the older models and easier to hit
130	neg	The one issue I have is why did you make the scroller button out of Teflon
130	pos	It's seriously the slipperiest roller on any mouse I've ever used; the last one had a nice rubber strip around it
131	pos	To me, this is fine as I need something heavier or my movements would be uncontrollable
131	pos	Sensor, settings and rbg are all perfect, G-Hub is a great program and lets you set different profiles for each game
132	pos	I mainly play FPS games and wanted a mouse for the extra buttons that would be advantageous in the heat of the moment
132	neg	Like the software that i needed to download, very unintuitive, i am in the process of having to open the app everytime i want to game
132	neg	thats sorta a hassleThe feel of the mouse is very odd for fps games, ive learned to like it, but its still an odd feeling compared to my old steelseries and redragon ones
133	pos	No complaints so far, I prefer all the weights in, as I have larger hands, and having more weight makes it smoother, I don't feel like I'm going to throw the mouse by accident
133	pos	Cable seems to be high quality, With the adjustable DPS and colors, it's fairly customizable as well
133	pos	Great mouse so far
134	pos	Bought this to replace the older version of this mouse
134	neg	My only gripe about these mice is that they're a bit small for my style of mouse use
134	pos	This works great at a good price
134	pos	This mouse is wired, which I prefer, and only has a single place that lights up
134	pos	Logitech typically makes a pretty solid product without getting ridiculous
134	pos	Body seems to be the same, just some upgraded components, which is just fine
134	pos	I knew exactly what to expect and got just that and then some
134	pos	Good times
135	neg	sadly this was worse than the others, within 8 hours of gaming the scroll wheel jad lost it click stops and had shorted the side wheel switches
135	neg	Gaming with it was impossible as if the mouse was moves it set off all the other actions i didn't want, causing me to die consistantly
135	neg	This is useless and I would recommend buying a "Red Dragon" mouse any day of the week, as they are much better quality
135	pos	I have used them and their keyboards for years gaming and have always been satisfied
135	neg	I will also be ignoring some of the you-tubers that recommend this product as they were obviously swayed by the mouse being given to them
135	neg	This mouse is a piece of junk
136	neg	The media could not be loaded
136	neg	This feature Works about 30% of the time
136	neg	I was dissatisfied with the unreliable connection given that the other two wired mouses i have do not experience this issue
137	pos	I bought this as a lightning deal for $39
137	pos	So, 40 bucks is a fair price point for this mouse - a separate software download from the internet makes it completely customizable to your liking
137	pos	The weights that come with it are nice quality
137	pos	Pros include weights you can add/subtract, DPI options, and LED lights with option to sync with other Logitech products
137	neg	Cons: Too big for my hand, lack of control b/c of overall size
138	pos	Cases of this were changing the functionality of some buttons on the mouse as provided by the software (g hub) and the dpi of the mouse
138	neg	Honestly disappointing
138	pos	Best part of the mouse was the mouse wheel which I had a lot of fun just spinning
138	neg	Probably won't buy from logitech anymore after this purchase
139	pos	Gaming and working from home these days, and this mouse handles it all
139	pos	For work you can setup several macros to get stuff done (set up two buttons for Cut & Paste for instance
139	neg	Do NOT use it for in game macros
139	pos	The keyboard I bought is also a Logitech, and the G Hub software that goes with these devices is excellent
139	pos	LED patterns that go across each in sequence, or separate (up to you)
139	neg	I found it jammed up under my keyboard
139	pos	Gold Standard
140	pos	I've owned many Logitech high-end gaming mice (and general Logitech mice) in the past
140	neg	The scroll wheel on the Hero is not only wobbly, but the tactile actuation force difference between left tilt and right tilt is significant
140	neg	In that right tilt is so easy to accidentally hit whereas left tilt requires quite a bit more force to actuate
140	neg	Well that and the lack of any additional grips, though I won't hold the grip against it
140	neg	TLDR: -2 stars for wobbling scroll wheel
140	neg	Right tilt too easy to trigger
140	neg	Wheel scrolling in notched mode is very loud, as loud as my Kaihl brown keyboard switches
141	neg	Pros:- Onboard memory (can pretty much carry my settings over to my work PC)- Customizable DPI, lighting, and buttons- Multiple profiles (configs you can cycle through)- Spinning scroll wheel with toggle button- Easily accessible DPI switch on the side (great for FPS games)Cons:- Noticeably small if you have large hands
141	neg	- Spin wheel toggle is kind of hard to click into place compared to the MX mice
141	neg	- Buttons feel kind of cheap
142	pos	That said, it's been smooth as butter from the beginning
142	pos	The mouse has good weight without the custom weights - which like all Logitech gaming mice come in their own separate case and can be mixed and matched
142	pos	Gaming I honestly haven't noticed a huge improvement but it has stayed the same, and that's all I needed
142	neg	The scroll wheel has the same two modes as the G500 - theres a loud clicky mode with more traction, and a quiet smoother mode for faster scrolling
142	pos	I love it and it was on sale for maybe $50 or so, to be honest I don't remember the price because it was low
143	pos	It has the exact same feel as the Proteus
143	neg	Its still heavy, you won't be walking into any FPS league championships with it
143	pos	Other games won't be hindered by the weight
143	pos	So you can make this look nearly identical to the Proteus
143	pos	I didn't think I'd care for the RGB as It tends to be dimmer than static lighting and I only want blue, but turns out I can make a better blue from it
143	pos	It feels exactly like the Proteus, exactly what I wanted
144	pos	I was extremely happy with this mouse for the first couple of months that I had it, until I began noticing an issue with the primary mouse button registering single clicks as two near-instantaneous clicks
144	neg	For anyone who enjoys gaming, they can probably infer that this is a horrible issue
144	neg	For example, if you're using a grappling hook that requires one click, and you're high up risking fall damage

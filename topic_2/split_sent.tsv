0	pos	I'm no 187329871 IQ pro gamer it's got enough buttons for me
0	pos	The button location are solid enough for me to be satisfied the only issue I have with this mouse is that the scroll wheel now spins freely and is one hell of a headache playing most fps games as the wheel usually switches weapons in most games
0	pos	So for example you run out of ammo in game and want to switch to your secondary
0	pos	well you'll switch to it but switch right back about 3 times
0	pos	Kind of a deal breaker for clutch moment gaming
0	pos	***edit***Turns out i'm an idiot
0	pos	There's a button that locks and unlocks the scroll wheel
0	pos	LMAO sooo yeah no this mouse is great i'm just not smart enough to properly utilize it
1	neg	This would be a wonderful mouse other than the constant click/double click issue
1	neg	The first one I had for a very short time
1	neg	During that time I was doing a lot of gaming/designing and the click issue showed up very quickly
1	neg	Amazon was great and provided an exchange
1	neg	During the time I had the new one, I was not doing as much gaming/designing so the click issue took longer to show up
1	neg	I am convinced this is a design flaw in the mouse itself
1	neg	I will not purchase another one of these
1	neg	The price is not worth it at all with the click issue
1	neg	To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or double clicks
1	neg	I have tested this extensively
1	neg	If it wasn't for that issue, this mouse would be wonderful
1	neg	However, this creates a lot of issues with gaming, graphic design and so much more when trying to work and renders the mouse almost useless because of productivity
2	neg	It seems logitech has either a quality control problem or a supply problem because the switches in these mice are absolute garbage
2	neg	The mouse is honestly one of the best mice I have ever used while it worked - until it didn't
2	neg	Less than a year old and $75 gets you a mouse that feels great in the hand until the scroll wheel starts jumping around and the left click starts randomly double clicking, and then not clicking at all - all intermittently
2	neg	There are numerous reviews out there one can find by simply googling "g502 double click" in which people either return them and hope their next one doesn't do the same, refund them, or the more technical self swap of a mechanical switch for the left click
2	neg	I will not be going any of these routes and I'm sad to say it because Logitech used to be a staple in PC peripherals
2	neg	Now it's not the plastic it's made of
2	neg	edit: As I write this update, I have actually taken another star off for the true, 1 star review
2	neg	I typically don't believe in one star reviews because it's generally an overreaction and everything is either 5 stars great or 1 star horrible, but Logitech has sunken to the 1 star territory
2	neg	After literally 15 emails back and forth with Logitech support, I had to use their website to prove I was having a double click issue, which was easily done, but had to film both myself, the mouse, and the serial number from the mouse in the video while doing it
2	neg	I could easily reproduce the double click fault in both the left AND right click function and sent proof
2	neg	I sent my mouse back to Logitech on approx the 10th of January 2020
2	neg	They received my mouse the 15th of January 2020
2	neg	I don't hear anything for 8 days until I first contact them again asking for an update
2	neg	Still nothing
2	neg	Finally I receive an email stating that my product is not faulty, and therefore doesn't qualify for the warranty
2	neg	Nevermind the evidence I had to first email them
2	neg	Nevermind the 100% reproduce able error in both left and right clicking
2	neg	I will never buy a logitech product again
2	neg	Do yourself a favor and google 'logitech double click' and question whether you want to buy this mouse, likely have the issue, and then not have the warranty honored
2	neg	I bought a cheap mouse replacement to tide me over and it works much better anyway
3	pos	Let me start by saying that I've used a lot of gaming mice, like, over 50 of them
3	pos	The Logitech g502 was always a quality mouse and tons of people love the thing just based on the design and overall quality of the mouse; That being said, there are a few things to consider if you're thinking about getting this one in particular
3	pos	The Pros of this mouse are fairly straightforward, and are as follows:- Comfortable shape for most right handed people, but should be more comfortable for people with medium to large size hands
3	pos	- Good build quality which easily places it in the same category as other 'premium' around this price point or even a bit higher
3	pos	-  Scroll wheel: this is one of my personal favorite features of the mouse
3	pos	Allows infinite scroll to get through annoying EULA pages quicker and also quickly raise or lower volume on YouTube or other video streaming sites, but without sacrificing the much needed precision of the standard mouse wheel steps
3	pos	Feels satisfying to use, but it is made of metal, which leads to a negative I'll be mentioning later on
3	pos	- Sensor: The Logitech Hero sensor has been tested numerous times and found to be roughly on par with the PMW3360 series sensors (including the 3366 on the original g502) while being advantageous for usage in wireless mice due to the lessened draw of power which allows for a longer battery life
3	pos	The Cons of this mouse make it hard to recommend to everyone, and are why I don't usually recommend it as a first choice
3	pos	-Weight: My god
3	pos	This thing is one of the heaviest mice I've used for an extended period of time
3	pos	I don't know exactly how much this weighs, but it feels pretty similar to the original, which I believe weighed in a little over 130 grams
3	pos	Most gaming mice target a weight of 100g or LIGHTER, since lowering the weight of the mouse will make extended use easier and will allow for a greater degree of control
3	pos	- Not a truly "safe" shape, this may or may not matter to you, but I felt that it's worth mentioning
3	pos	Obviously this is a mouse for right handed people, and it may not necessarily be a great fit for you if your hands are very small (I have very small hands and cannot reach the sniper button at all, but the mouse is still comfortable)
3	pos	I would say it's a top tier mouse, but only if you can look past the weight
3	pos	I would recommend that, as always, if you have the ability to do so, you should go to a local store and try some of the mice out to see which feels best to you, and make your decision after you have an idea what type of mouse shape you want
3	pos	I won't recommend that you do or don't buy a product, so I'll leave it at that
4	pos	Scroll wheel broke within the first week and now it freewheels like fidget spinner
4	pos	Useless
5	pos	i play alot of many types of games which makes me need as many buttons as possible on my mouse
5	pos	i had the g502 and then when i i saw an upgrade, as any serious gamer, i had to have" the best"
5	pos	the laser and accuracy is the best ive touched ever
5	pos	BUT
5	pos	they need to add this laser to the g600 mmo mouse and /or arrange the button layout a little bit better for short finger
5	pos	i frequently hit extra buttons on the mouse and the thumb button makes me hold the entire mouse in a uncomfortable way
5	pos	in summation  if you are hard core about fps's this is the mouse you need, want and have to have
5	pos	if you are all about warcraft or whatever other mmo is out right now, not so much
6	pos	This review is for the Hero version of G502
6	pos	I have stopped using Logitech mice since they discontinued G9
6	pos	I have been using Roccat Kone XTD since then that died after serving me for over 5 years
6	pos	After reading reviews about G502 I decided to give it a try as I really liked the overall design and feel , it reminded me of G9
6	pos	So when I learned they are refreshing the 502 with a new sensor I was skeptical to pay $30 more for the new one
6	pos	Now that I used it I am glad I did
6	pos	The refreshed model has a really thick and flexible cord that was apparently a major weakness in the original 502
6	pos	Couple that with a really awesome sensor that is super accurate and sensitive to slightest movements and tracks on any surface (seriously I tried everything from a white paper to the palm of my hand) and you have a potential winner
6	pos	However, the best part of this mouse is not that or the the materials that they used which also feels really nice and durable
6	pos	While subjective and relevant to how big or small your hands are for me the way the mouse sits in my hand and how easy it is to access the buttons are the best indicators
6	pos	The buttons themselves feel very satisfying to press thanks to the spring loaded mechanism
6	pos	Last but not least is the scroll wheel
6	pos	This
6	pos	this scrollwheel I can probably write a whole paragraph on how good it is
6	pos	Not only does it have the infinite mode that rolls beautifully but also its made from METAL
6	pos	Its a nice chunk of metal that is just better than a plastic one in every way
6	pos	I dont think I can go back to plastic mouse-wheels after using my G502
6	pos	You might never use the 16000DPI sensor but if you used G502 and similar mice in the past and are due for an upgrade the refresh 502 is totally worth the money Logitech is asking for
7	neg	The media could not be loaded
7	neg	ORDERED = 05/11/2019 || SELLER = Amazon
7	neg	com LLC || PAID = $59
7	neg	35((FAILED ON 09/18/2020)):: PROS ::1
7	neg	) Improved braided cable over previous G502 model
7	neg	2
7	neg	) The weight options are exact same as previous model
7	neg	(Feels identical in all ways, easy to get used to
7	neg	)3
7	neg	) I'm about 6'-6" and little over 200 lbs - fits my hand fairly well
7	neg	(They don't make many BIG HAND mice :)4
7	neg	) DPI shift button is epic for sniping btw
7	neg	(Great for nudging objects in Adobe too
7	neg	)5
7	neg	) LIGHTSYNC added to this model is cool for custom rigs & lighting
7	neg	(Single click, easy to enable
7	neg	)6
7	neg	) Fully customizable RGB LED, you can set color, cycle speed & mode indicators
7	neg	7
7	neg	) VERY VERY accurate mouse, 4,000 DPI higher than previous 12,000 DPI 502 model
7	neg	16,000 DPI is insane resolution tbh
7	neg	8
7	neg	) Rubberized areas can handle greasy, salty gamer hands lol (see pics
7	neg	)
7	neg	they are the most durable grips I have ever seen in my 30 years of using mice
7	neg	:: CONS ::((FAILED)) LEFT MOUSE BUTTON FAILURE - The older version I have is more reliable after 3 years
7	neg	Logitech products across the board are having durability issues
7	neg	Their OLDER 2015 - 2018 Products were far superior
7	neg	Not sure what is going on with their design and quality control, but after MANY years and thousands of dollars of products there is a noticeable DROP in QUALITY & more specifically DURABILITY
7	neg	((Possibly they are too trick for their own good)1
7	neg	) The cord is much better, but this mouse still has one
7	neg	(It's hard to find CONS with the G502 HERO
7	neg	)2
7	neg	) Really miss the cordless days, but this mouse catches every signal & the slightest movements
7	neg	3
7	neg	) The RGB is usually not prominent as it's under your hand or in sleep mode
7	neg	4
7	neg	) Free wheel mouse mode can be sensitive to twitch gaming
7	neg	Some rolling can occur, but you gotta be really shaking it
7	neg	:: OVERALL :: I HATE CORDS, but I love this mouse so I am always torn between both worlds
7	neg	I need to be highly accurate in my video, photography & gaming life, all the G502 series mice have enhanced my computer work & play
7	neg	I have purchased 3 of them now, 2 of which have HEAVY use & abuse
7	neg	they still work perfectly and remain accurate
7	neg	Seriously this mouse brought my K/D up to new highs, it's so much better than the $100 cordless laser I'm still kind of in shock
7	neg	It's a gaming AND business must have
7	neg	Using this for websites, photo editing & detail alignments in Adobe is a dream come true
7	neg	DON'T FORGET IT's EVEN GOT MACROS
7	neg	I don't use them to their full potential, but the few macros I have are awesome
7	neg	FINAL NOTE: My first G502 is still rock solid even after years of abuse, nothing has failed
7	neg	Mouse wheel is 100% & so is the weight latch
7	neg	I hated Logitech until I used the 502's, their mousewheels fail, wireless signal loss is constant (with exception to the $100 wireless lasers
7	neg	) AND the rubberized grips always turned to 'sticky goo' after 3-4 years
7	neg	I was pissed off at Logitech when I bought the 502 & was ready to rip apart this mouse in a review if it SUCKED
8	neg	I bought this mouse to replace the Logitech Performance MX, I had 4 of those in the past two years and they are great until they get the infamous double click issue
8	neg	I did not want to spend another $99 on that and hopped this mouse would work better
8	neg	The good:- It is a nice looking mouse from outsideThe bad:- Right out of the box, this mouse started randomly double clicking or needed to click multiple times for it to react
8	neg	- On free-wheel mode, it just scrolls with the movement of the mouse, even if the wheel is not moving at all
8	neg	- Not at all ergonomic, it will hurt your hand after 10 minutes using it
8	neg	The back is too narrow, no support for the right side of your hand, and to hold it properly you have to close your hand in an awkward way
8	neg	- Both options of the software to program/change settings are unnecessarily intrusive on your computer, and every 30 minutes or so, make it go sluggish with the mouse barely responding
8	neg	If you remove the software the default settings for the buttons are useless
8	neg	I have been a loyal Logitech buyer for over 20 years, but the quality of their products has been on a free fall for a while now, and this is the last product I buy from them
8	neg	The quality of the product no longer justifies the price
8	neg	So long Logitech, we had a good run
9	neg	I really wanted to love this mouse
9	neg	This style of form factor, with a nice little ledge for your thumb to rest on, doesn't get enough love from mouse OEMs
9	neg	I also am a contrarian in still liking heavier mice, despite the recent trend in favor of ultra-light mice, and this thing feels nice and solid with the weights added
9	neg	Finally, I really liked that the mouse is WIRED
9	neg	Having run the gamut of wireless mice, I have found no matter what the claims are, they always are prone to connection glitches and, even when they work well for a time, are a PITA to always remember to keep charged
9	neg	The new hero sensor is also awesome
9	neg	Because of these desirable properties I lived in a state of denial about the mouse's many glaring flaws for months
9	neg	Sadly, I am out of denial and into grief
9	neg	The main issue with this mouse is the scroll wheel
9	neg	It just sucks
9	neg	The mouse semi-regularly just decides the scroll wheel is being clicked, resulting in lots of odd behavior
9	neg	And then it's hard to know when you've successfully clicked the scroll wheel down, because it requires so much actuation force and yet has so little travel
9	neg	The free-wheeling mode of the scroll wheel is reasonably nice, with a satisfying long spin, but it's almost impossible not to occasionally click the button that puts it back into incremental scrolling mode
9	neg	This is a big deal, because the incremental scrolling mode is unbelievably ghastly and thus something you would never use voluntarily The tactility feels all wrong--both too abrupt/tactile and not sticky enough for something that is so abrupt/tactile
9	neg	At the same time, the scroll wheel actually rattles because of the force of the increments--but only like maybe half the time
9	neg	The combination of these features induces an overall sensation of unpredictability and randomness along with an unpleasant sound
9	neg	A less critical but still painful flaw is the button placement
9	neg	The idea of a little ledge sticking out is to use a palm grip and rest your thumb there, right
9	neg	One would think so
9	neg	However, doing so places one of the other two main side buttons totally out of reach
9	neg	You have bend your thumb back so hard to reach back button that it basically means only a claw grip is truly comfortable--in which case the thumb ledge goes unused
9	neg	So, all in all, yeah I think Logitech should go back to the drawing board and generate this style of mouse with different button placement and a much more nicely tuned scroll wheel
10	neg	Purchased this mouse on July 2nd and as of the day of this review the mouse went from being a 5 to a 1
10	neg	I really expected so much more out of Logitech and incredibly upset that in less then a month the mouse is already giving me issues
10	neg	I purchased this mouse to replace my old razer deathadder which lasted me for approximately 3 years
10	neg	I figured since I already owned the G402 that it would make sense to upgrade to a G502 and give it a shot with the weights feature
10	neg	The weights were pretty nice and helped in a way, but what makes me give this mouse a 1 rating is the right click problem that so many people complained about
10	neg	So when I play Overwatch I play A LOT of widow and recently the right click would always double click as I'm sitting there scoped in
10	neg	It happened so frequently that I can't even play the game properly
10	neg	So if you're looking for a game that you need to scope STAY AWAY
10	neg	The double clicking is truly a problem and I decided to risk purchasing this mouse even after seeing so many complain about it in the reviews
10	neg	So again, if you need to hold your clicks, keep searching for another mouse
10	neg	Shame on you Logitech :(
11	neg	Loved this mouse for 3 months, absolutely everything
11	neg	Then one day it started to randomly double click on the right mouse button, but only maybe once per 1,000 clicks, no big deal right
11	neg	Wrong
11	neg	This escalates and quickly becomes to 1 in every 10 clicks just a month after you notice the first double click issue starting
11	neg	Being a "gaming mouse", and a reputable company, I expected more
11	neg	I took the time to write the review now because after 4 months with my right click double clicking every 1 out of 10 clicks the left mouse button has started the 1 out of 1,000
11	neg	My fear is that in another month I'll have the same issue with the left click
11	neg	This mouse is already un-usable for gaming as any fps with scopes become unplayable as you cannot reliably ADS or hold scopes in fear that it will double click and make you lose ADS or lose your scope
12	neg	This was a really great mouse prior to it developing a double left click issue under a year of use
12	neg	I did some digging online and found that this seems to be due to their mouse switches
12	neg	I've been a big Logitech fan since the G15 and G9 days
12	neg	I'm currently still using a G13 and G910 but I will be avoiding Logitech mice going forward
12	neg	I'm currently thinking about going back to Razer mice due to this cheaping out on the switches issue to save a few dollars
12	neg	Logitech, if you are reading this: if you need to charge an extra 5 dollars to put great switches in your mice, then DO IT
12	neg	Making cheap products like this only hurts your brand and will make people move away from you
12	neg	I went from Razer mice to Logitech because their mice had a fraying issue with their cords and Logitech was one of the first to start making them with a reinforced wire to prevent it
12	neg	Looks like I'm going back to Razer as the tables have turned now
12	neg	Fix your products Logitech
12	neg	I'm just glad I still have my older G502 Proteus Core and Proteus Spectrum mice to fall back on for the time being as those had switches that don't seem to have the issue
12	neg	RMA is not worth it to me as I've read the review people have had them go bad again due to their bad switches
12	neg	It's not worth my time and or money of sending this back and forth
13	pos	I was a big fan of Logitech, all the mice that I have purchased for all my computers since the 1990's have been either Logitech (95%) or Razer (5%) and ive had over 20 mice over the years
13	pos	I dont mistreat my mice, the reason that I usually end up replacing mice is because a newer one comes out with more buttons or features and I replace my current mouse
13	pos	Unfortunately on the Logitech  G502 Hero the left mouse button starts to malfunction and to click an extra time or wont hold the left mouse button down when I have my finger held down on it (to drag objects on the screen) it will release the button without me letting go of the button effectively making it impossible to drag objects across the screen
13	pos	The left mouse button will also start experiencing issues where it starts to click more than the times that you actually clicked, 1 click will register as 2-3 clicks and double clicking will register as if you clicked 4+ times
13	pos	The Logitech G502 Hero that I purchased from Amazon for $68
13	pos	29 on 04/18/2019 started experiencing the dreaded extra clicking and unable to hold the left mouse button down issues on 03/30/2020  (a little less than a year after purchase) and I contacted Logitech support which then had me follow several troubleshooting steps and film a video of the issue with my phone's camera and send it to them
13	pos	Logitech replaced the original defective mouse for free on 04/05/2020 but now on 01/15/2021 the replacement mouse that Logitech sent me is starting to experience the same issue agian with the left mouse button clicking extra times and releasing the left mouse button when I have my finger held down without me letting go of the button, thats the second G502 Hero thats failed in under a year
13	pos	Almost all the 20+ mice that I have purchased since the 1990's have been Logitech (95%) which were excellent quality and the other 5% have been Razer mice which were not as good as the Logitech mice and were overpriced
13	pos	I dont really think its worth it to spend $50+ on a mouse and then have it fail at 12 months or less so this time I purchased a $20 Asus TUF M3 to replace my $68
13	pos	29 Logitech G502 Hero, at least if the Asus mouse starts having the same issue at a year or less I only spent $20 on it
13	pos	I hope that Logitech quality improves in the future because I was reading 3 star and under reviews online for the Logitech G502 Hero and the issues that I am experiencing seem to be pretty common (it seems that the sensor that registers the clicks is made in China and is poor quality) some people mention that they replaced the sensor that registers mouse clicks with a Japanese sensor and it got rid of the issues but im not technical enough to open up the mouse, find the replacement part online, and then put it in the defective mouse so ill just buy a replacement $20 mouse from Asus
14	neg	I've always loved Logitech products, and have used them for decades because of their quality and customer service
14	neg	But this mouse, even when it's working, is just above average for a gaming mouse IMO
14	neg	It has high DPI settings which is nice, but mostly useless because not many people even get close to touching those settings
14	neg	They're far too sensitive for the vast majority of people
14	neg	The main problem with this mouse is quality
14	neg	It'll last you between 6 months and a year before the left click stops working properly
14	neg	There have been issues with left click problems for YEARS on Logitech mice, and it doesn't seem like they've done anything to try to fix the problem
14	neg	I have 4 versions of this mouse in my house
14	neg	My girlfriend has the previous non-Hero version, and that worked great for about 2 solid years of very light use before it started having issues
14	neg	When you click, it double clicks
14	neg	It's very frustrating and annoying
14	neg	I built my daughter a computer a year ago, and got her the Hero
14	neg	It worked great at first, so I decided to get me one too
14	neg	Mine lasted until the RMA period was over, and then the left click stopped working
14	neg	Not the typical double click problem though
14	neg	Mine can't register a click+hold for long
14	neg	So when you try to drag an icon on your desktop to the trash, it'll just keep dropping the icon in random places
14	neg	If you try to bookmark a tab in your browser
14	neg	Drag it half way and it'll suddenly let go of the tab and create a new browser window out of the tab
14	neg	Try to drag mail to a folder in Outlook
14	neg	It'll probably let go of the mail and drop it in the wrong folder, etc
14	neg	If you have to click+hold in a game to register an action
14	neg	It won't work
14	neg	At this point, my daughters mouse was still working, so I thought maybe I just got a defective mouse
14	neg	I went to Fry's (instead of buying on Amazon this time, because I was in a hurry) and bought the exact same mouse
14	neg	It hasn't even been 6 months and it already has the same exact problem
14	neg	All 4 of our Logitech mice, similar make and model, have all had problems with the left click
14	neg	All of them purchased from different places over 2+ years of time
14	neg	The problems I'm having aren't just a fluke
14	neg	They're not a result of getting a unlucky bad mouse
14	neg	There's a very good chance if you buy this mouse, you'll have similar problems within a year, even with light use
14	neg	As a gaming mouse, this thing should be able to stand up to abuse, but it'll break even with light use
14	neg	That makes it a BAD gaming mouse, and a bad mouse in general
14	neg	Even writing this review, I tried to highlight some text to copy/paste it to another section, and I can't even do that
14	neg	I had to hold shift+arrow keys to highlight the text because my mouse will just delete it or move it to some random places while I'm still holding left click/dragging
14	neg	Ugh
14	neg	On top of that, this mouse is fairly skinny and does not fit large hands very well
14	neg	It's not comfortable at all unless you have fairly small hands
14	neg	The Corsiars M65 was a much better fit for large hands, and is just as good as the G502 in pretty much every way except looks, and far better in terms of quality/longevity
14	neg	As an old school Logitech fanboy, it makes me really sad to write this review
14	neg	Don't buy this mouse
14	neg	There's 10-20 other gaming mice out there that are just as good, and better quality
14	neg	Look elsewhere
15	neg	From the standpoint of how this mouse feels, it is amazing
15	neg	In the short period of time it actually works it is wonderful
15	neg	Having said that, from a quality aspect it is a pile of flaming trash
15	neg	I am now on my second G502 Hero mouse
15	neg	Both have the exact same problem where the left mouse button starts double-clicking for any presses after about 3 months of use and therefore holding the mouse button does not work
15	neg	Additionally, now that Logitech has reduced capacity due to COVID getting in touch with a person is impossible and the warranty submission and ticket creation systems DO NOT work
15	neg	Both take me directly back to the product page creating an endless cycle
15	neg	I also tried the "Support Bot" and go to the point where it asked if I wanted to create a ticket, but it just shows a repeated progress meter like it is going to do something and never actually completes
15	neg	While not directly related to this issue, I also had a Logitech K810 keyboard fail, which was BEFORE COVID and the device was quickly replaced (when I could actually reach someone); however, it was within a 3 month period of having purchased that product as well
15	neg	I have used Logitech products since the 1980s, but given this many failures in such short periods of time I cannot and will not recommend using their products any longer
16	neg	Bought this for my husband and he really liked it however it didn’t last long
16	neg	My husband plays wow and other pc games and this mouse didn’t last but a few months
16	neg	We purchased it April 2019 and are having issues with the buttons no longer working properly
16	neg	My husband takes care of his electronics so they usually last years
16	neg	His last gaming mouse lasted 5 years
16	neg	So it’s not user mishandling
16	neg	I’d go with a different option if you want it o last longer than a couple months
17	pos	I've had my Logitech G500 for so long, I can't even remember using another mouse unless I was at one of those *shudder* shared workstations
17	pos	But, like all good things, electronics must come to an end
17	pos	I chose the G502 Hero to replace my beloved G500 and am rather happy with this little guy
17	pos	I'm not a gamer, I use this mouse for work mostly doing data analysis and TSQL, so my wants & needs are quite a bit different than most
17	pos	Pros:- Since the weights are customizable, I still get to have the nice heavy mouse I've always loved
17	pos	- Granular DPI adjustments let me set up the speed just how I like it and lets me pick and choose just the right places for the 9,485 screenshots I need to take daily to show people why they're wrong
17	pos	- All buttons are able to be unassigned, so if you're not a gamer and you're worried about hitting the wrong thing, don't, it's not a big deal
17	pos	- The lighting is totally customizable, so if you don't want to see cool glowing lights on your mouse, don't
17	pos	If you think it's cool, have fun
17	pos	- Still ergonomic as ever
17	pos	I use mine with an old IMAK ergoBeads wrist pad and no pain
17	pos	- The cord is REALLY LONG, so if your main desktop/laptop/docking device is far away, it's not a problem
17	pos	Cons:- I prefer to have a clicking scroll wheel (you can also choose to have the scroll wheel free-scroll with the push of a button)
17	pos	It's kind of loud
17	pos	Not loud enough to bother anyone while I'm scrolling on a conference call, but louder than the G500
17	pos	- The bottom part to get to the weights is a little difficult to remove
17	pos	Once it's set though, you don't need to worry about it anymore
17	pos	May this mouse give as many years as it's predecessor
18	neg	I still have my MX518 from 15 years ago and the only think that has gone bad is the cable, which I easily replaced with a quick search online
18	neg	I just wanted a nice upgrade as I still own the MX (and going strong) This piece of junk started to malfunction barely before the year mark (supposedly they use omnron switches marketed for a gazillion actuation life)
18	neg	I am a casual gamer and the only one who uses my computer is me, so I know the device was not abused in any way or form
18	neg	Logitech support is a joke
18	neg	After wasting 2 hours trying to have a representative online, they were not able to process my RMA because their "system" was not able to process my serial number
18	neg	So no, they just gave me a phone number
18	neg	I called the phone number and it was a labyrinth of menus until finally I was able to reach the correct team
18	neg	Waited and waited until I hung up exactly 15 minutes after no one replied
18	neg	Take my advice and don't waste your hard earn money in a company that can't stand behind their products
18	neg	The mouse went directly into the trash bin
19	neg	I ignored the reviews that reported the double-click issue
19	neg	There's been times I've bought products others said were defective and never had a problem, so I figured I would still get it
19	neg	That was just gambling for quality, trying to beat the odds
19	neg	Boy, is my face red
19	neg	Bought at the end of April, double-clicking severely by October
19	neg	Trying to do anything with this mouse is now a hassle
19	neg	Most games are unplayable
19	neg	If I click once, I need it to register one click
19	neg	Not two, three, or more
19	neg	I contacted Logitech support, as it is under warranty
19	neg	After about a week they responded with a process that almost completely would absolve them of having to follow through - jumping through hoops with steps up to and including a click testing website where you have to record video with your phone and send it to them to prove it
19	neg	I'm not going to deal with such an absurd process, so while they may have saved on having to honor the warranty, they've lost a customer
19	neg	I'll never buy a Logitech product again
19	neg	Please don't make the same mistake I did
19	neg	Don't buy this
19	neg	You will get the same issue, almost guaranteed
19	neg	Aside from the issue above, the mouse has programmable DPI settings
19	neg	Which is nice, and only necessary because the default settings are weirdly too fast or too slow
19	neg	The buttons to change the DPI settings is in a spot where I constantly hit them accidentally, which is annoying, but I think that's more a me problem
19	neg	The RGB lights change colors, but the mouse doesn't remember that until the Logitech software you need to have is turned on
19	neg	The mouse wheel either spins freely, which is stupid, or turns into a chunky megalithic clickmonster if you lock it
19	neg	The scroll left/right by moving the mouse wheel left or right doesn't really work correctly
19	neg	Neither does pressing in the mouse wheel to scroll up or down by holding it
19	neg	It just stops
19	neg	Very frustrating
19	neg	Decent heavy duty cord, ergonomically ok, comfortable at least
19	neg	You can change the little weights inside but I'll be honest, unless you're some kind of die-hard gamer playing semi-professionally I can't see any reason someone would need that
19	neg	Ultimately, I give the whole thing two stars; it probably would have been four but it loses one for the multi click problem almost everyone seems to get, and another for the unbelievable burden their support places on people to discourage anyone from actually being able to get a fix or replacement under warranty
19	neg	Bad business, that
19	neg	Again - don't buy this
19	neg	Odds are a cheap no-name brand would last longer
20	pos	UPDATE 4/21/20: Just received a warranty replacement for the mouse
20	pos	Increased my rating to 3 stars
20	pos	Still unhappy that the mouse broke so quickly, especially for the price and target use
20	pos	I purchased the mouse in May 2019
20	pos	Beginning in March 2020, the mouse started acting funny
20	pos	The left mouse button would not work correctly in 2 ways: 1) single clicks were sent as double clicks and vice versa, and 2) click-and-drag stopped working
20	pos	Instead, it acted as if I released the mouse button mid-movement and then clicked again
20	pos	This would have the effect of dragging a different item than I originally selected
20	pos	Both of these issues affect gaming, but they also affects work, as dragging formulas in Excel or moving e-mails to folders no longer work
20	pos	Also, trying to select a word or sentence by double-clicking is nearly impossible
20	pos	Searching Logitech's forums, this appears to be a known issue, reported by many users
20	pos	I have contacted Logitech support, but have not received a reply yet
20	pos	I will update this review once/if I do
20	pos	Otherwise, I would warn others to avoid a mouse that stops working correctly after only a few months
21	pos	I am unfortunately replacing a mouse I really liked, the Corsair M65, which suffered from a way too early failure
21	pos	I've used Logitech mice forever and they just keep going, so that'll likely be the last time I venture off to another brand
21	pos	Comparing these two, they have a very similar size, look and feel
21	pos	This one is nearly as heavy without the weights as was the M65 with all three weights
21	pos	I think I liked the M65's aluminum construction a bit better, but the plastic on this one doesn't leave anything to be desired and the grippy material on this mouse sides is a nice touch
21	pos	This unit's button placement is far superior over the M65, I don't find myself inadvertently activating any buttons like I did with the Corsair
21	pos	The scroll resistance on this mouse wheel is also a bit better, very defined clicks and it's also adjustable to free spin if desired
21	pos	It is comfortable enough to use as an every day mouse and has optional features that can be used for gaming
21	pos	Overall, I think this is a better mouse than the Corsair and so long as it holds up, I'll keep my review at 5 stars
21	pos	Update:  I'm starting to think these rather expensive gaming mice are just a cash grab
21	pos	The middle mouse button on this one failed to scroll properly after only 29 days of use
21	pos	Thank goodness I was still within the Amazon return window
21	pos	Mice have been around for a long time and the tech to make them reliable has also been around for a long time
21	pos	Something is wrong with the middle mouse button on these gaming mice, this is the second one from two different companies to fail shortly after purchase
21	pos	I'll get this one replaced, but my next mouse is going to be a cheap one
21	pos	At least they work reliably for a good long time
21	pos	This is unacceptable to have premature failures like this on $50 mice when the $12 special will go for a decade
21	pos	Update 2:  The replacement mouse has held up so far, so I'm upgrading the review stars a bit
21	pos	I do have semi-frequent problems with dust getting stuck in the laser's sensor area
21	pos	When this happens, I get really bad tracking and have to blow on it to clear whatever's in there
21	pos	Not super inconvenient, but also not a "feature" that I've seen from any other mouse that I've used in 20 years
21	pos	Update 3:  Middle mouse wheel failed at about 16 months, back down to 1 star
21	pos	I'm done with these expensive mice
21	pos	I've had mice last 10+ years, but can't get a single "high-end gaming mouse" to last even 2 years
21	pos	I'm either the unluckiest guy ever, or I suspect these are just a cash grab
21	pos	$13 off brand mouse it is
22	pos	You can easily and quickly switch between the pre-programmed sensitivity or adjust your own sensitivity presets
22	pos	You can adjust the weight to your preference and it fits nicely in your hand
22	pos	Light effects are cool and you can customize the logo if you download the free Logitech software
22	pos	Now for the dislikes, and there are many
22	pos	The mouse does not increase my skill at videogames, I'm just able to get to where I'm going to die faster because I have better control
22	pos	This mouse does not help with my Call of Duty trash talk
22	pos	Kids named Kyle still call me out as a middle-aged gamer and know exactly how cool I'm not
22	pos	But Kyle, if you are reading this, my mouse is better
22	pos	Maybe your mom can order one for you after I drop her off after our date
23	pos	The mouse specs are straight forward, and covered in the description of the product
23	pos	However, as a side note, there was no noticeable performance increase with the hero sensor compared to their last generation
23	pos	That was to be expected since Logitech already had phenomenal sensors so any difference is probably on the test results not human use
23	pos	That being said, I'll just do a quick pro, con list
23	pos	Pros:- Solid construction- good button placement- buttons are light, and crisp- Decent support software whether that is Logitech gaming software or the hub
23	pos	- Comparable price to competitor mice with similar features
23	pos	Cons:- Scroll wheel is not rubberized like the G900 and is very hard to grip
23	pos	- There is no comfort groove in the right mouse button like there is with the left (preference)- Mouse is heavy, even without the weights
23	pos	If you like to do flick shots or lift your mouse up you may feel fatigue over time compared to other Logitech mice that weigh around 75grams
23	pos	- Edit: There is no support for forward and backward scroll wheel as buttons in their software per this review
23	pos	Would be nice to have like Roccats swarm software
23	pos	Conclusion: This is a well priced product
23	pos	The sensor is incredible, comparable to other brands such as Roccat, Razer, and Steel Series (among others like Zowie)
23	pos	It is heavy, more for larger hands, and the scroll wheel could have been rubber for grip
23	pos	I'll personally use this for MOBAS and RTS but it is far too heavy for dedicated fps like Overwatch and COD
23	pos	I'd personally recommend the Logitech G Pro/Pro Hero if you are an FPS player that needs fewer buttons
24	neg	The design and ergonomics of this mouse are outstanding
24	neg	All the buttons are placed perfectly, the freewheeling ability of the scroll wheel makes traversing long web pages or documents incredibly easy
24	neg	Even the companion software doesn't give me that much to complain about
24	neg	But the Chinese Omron switches Logitech puts in this mouse are terrible, and Logitech knows it
24	neg	Within two months of my original purchase, I began experiencing the dreaded double click issue, and quickly opened a ticket with Logitech support
24	neg	To their credit, they were able to quickly send me a replacement with very little fuss
24	neg	Now, less than 10 months of only moderate use later, not only has the left click started to intermittently have the double clicking issue, but the mouse 5 button has failed entirely
24	neg	I have opened another support ticket, and hope to be able to get yet another replacement, but this is unacceptable
24	neg	They know these switches are bad
24	neg	Consumers have had to resort to repairing the switches themselves or even buying the higher quality Japanese made Omron switches to drop in as replacements
24	neg	If I do get a SECOND replacement (within only the first year of owning this mouse) I will gladly continue to use it until it too starts to display these issues, but I can't in good conscience recommend this mouse to anyone
24	neg	Which is a terrible shame because I love almost everything about it, but a mouse that cannot click things as intended is not a mouse worth paying for
25	neg	Many years ago Logitech was the go-to brand for computer peripherals but for the last decade my experience with their mice has been quite poor
25	neg	I have Logitech webcams that after many years are still great, an illuminated keyboard that's lasted a decade and a 5
25	neg	1 speaker set that's lasted even longer
25	neg	My first Logitech mouse the 518 similarly lasted many years before the middle mouse button started to fail
25	neg	Next I replaced it with another one which failed within a year
25	neg	After that I went to a G400 that within 2 years started to have button fails / produce the double click error
25	neg	Maybe it's a fluke, got another G400
25	neg	Failed at about a year
25	neg	Will try the G502, again not even a whole year before it started failing along with the double click error
25	neg	2nd G502 - same result 1 year
25	neg	This is in a dry, temperature controlled, clean environment with no liquids or foods being spilled on it
25	neg	I've already gotten the new out of retirement version of the Mx518 but if it produces the same result I'm looking elsewhere for my next mouse
25	neg	Update: I tried to return the two mice I had that were within warranty
25	neg	Logitech wants you to record yourself clicking the mouse over 100 times on a 3rd party site designed to check for double clicks while holding the serial number in the frame
25	neg	That's just the first step of the potential return process
25	neg	No more Logitech mice for me
25	neg	The double click issue is well know enough by Logitech to already have a process in place for you, not them to document it, then they know its a widespread issue and should stop wasting the customers time
26	neg	Update Aug 29, 2019: I submitted a support ticket to Logitech a week ago, and I have not gotten any response from their support other than the initial confirmation with the support ticket number
26	neg	The same day I submitted my support ticket I went and bought a SteelSeries Rival 600 to hold me over until I would hopefully receive a replacement from Logitech, but after using the Rival 600 I can say I will not be going back to Logitech for a gaming mouse ever again
26	neg	TL;DR: This mouse has a sensor issue present in both of the ones I have and the 2nd one I received directly from Logitech support had developed an issue with its right-click in only 3 months of use
26	neg	I got the G502 HERO as a replacement to my long time favorite mouse the G502 Proteus Core
26	neg	The decision to upgrade was due to natural wear on the Proteus Core from over years of use along with the desire to have better software support for managing mouse profiles and settings through the newer Logitech G HUB software
26	neg	My first HERO mouse arrived at the beginning of April, and from day one I had some issues getting the thing configured
26	neg	With the Proteus Core I had been using the Logitech Gaming Software to manage profiles, lights, and configurations but I want to make sure I was using the recommended software with the new HERO mouse
26	neg	I opted to uninstall the LGS so that I could install G Hub without any worry of problem or conflict between the two pieces of software
26	neg	When attempting to install G Hub it would get stuck at the "Downloading and Installing" part of the installer, and this was after leaving it be for almost an hour
26	neg	After killing the install process, I scoured my systems for remnants of LGS from AppData folders to Registry entries to make sure I deleted anything that could cause conflict
26	neg	Upon rebooting I attempted to install G Hub again only to yield the same issue I encountered before all of this taking on Windows 10 Pro 1809 at the time
26	neg	Since I couldn't get the G Hub software working I figured I would have to reset or reinstall Windows to make sure the software was working with a blank slate, but I was not about to reinstall my whole OS to test that theory just to get my mouse to work so I resorted to reinstalling LGS to get my new HERO mouse configured
26	neg	Now that the mouse had been configured to my preferred button layout and DPI setting, I was able to starting using it normally
26	neg	To make sure everything felt normal I quickly went through a couple of my regular games to verify that my muscle memory was still relevant since the HERO is the exactly same form factor as the Proteus Core
26	neg	The new mouse was proving to be what I had hoped for, barring the earlier dilemma with the software
26	neg	Over the course of April I occasionally had something very strange happen while in use; at random times without predictors or warning my cursor on screen would shoot to one of the corners of my screen and get pinned there
26	neg	In FPS games this would cause my character to suddenly start staring at the ground or the sky while rapidly spinning in one direction, indicating that the mouse was perceiving continuous horizontal and vertical inputs despite the mouse being stationary
26	neg	This could only be interrupted by lifting the mouse off of the mousepad, a CORSAIR MM600,  and setting it back down, which would stop the constant input and everything would go back to normal
26	neg	In over 6 years of gaming on PC, 3 of which were with the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, I had never encountered any issue like this with any of the Razer or Logitech mice I had used up to that point
26	neg	Come mid May the issue had persisted, so I found a day to reinstall Windows 10 to the latest version 1903 in the hopes that finally being able to run the G Hub software would somehow magically fix what I believe to be a sensor issue with the mouse itself
26	neg	With Windows 10 1903 installed, the G Hub software finally complete its own installation without an issue, but the cursor still continued to randomly get pinned to a corner of the screen without warning
26	neg	Since I had confidently ruled out software, I decided to contact Logitech support
26	neg	After explaining everything to the support agent, they decided that they would send me a new replacement mouse which arrived only a few days later
26	neg	Within only a couple weeks I experienced the cursor issue again with the replacement HERO mouse from Logitech support, but it seemed to happen less often so I dealt with it
26	neg	It has been over 3 months since getting the replacement and now the replacement had developed its own issue with the right-click being unable to be consistently held down
26	neg	I want to love this mouse, but unless Logitech can improve their QC I cannot recommend them at this time
27	neg	This is the second G502 I bought in my lifetime
27	neg	I bought this to back up my G903 mouse (that also broke in under 2 years)
27	neg	Now, I bought this G502, because the first one I bought worked really well
27	neg	It lasted a long while, no issues, and it's what has sold me on keeping on with Logi products
27	neg	Well, shame on me, because I've been fooled
27	neg	What's wrong with this new G502
27	neg	Plenty
27	neg	It just started up, and it's a doozy
27	neg	The mouse, when sitting still, sends signals to my PC to move my cursor, when
27	neg	I'm not even
27	neg	touching the mouse
27	neg	Not only that, but the mouse seems to disconnect from my pc and reset the DPI to a higher DPI than I'm comfortable with
27	neg	Basically, the mouse has a spasm and just does its own thing for a little while until it decides to say hello to the pc again
27	neg	What was wrong with the G903
27	neg	Bad, cheap, switches
27	neg	I did not learn about them until the G903 went kaput
27	neg	Logi uses cheap switches doomed to fail, fantastic
27	neg	After all this, I can't help but to be severely disappointed
27	neg	I bought this G502 a few days ago, it already has issues
27	neg	And trust me when I say, you're probably better off biting the bullet and just buying a mouse from a different brand
27	neg	I certainly don't want to bother trying to get a refund from the stingy corporation that is Logi with cheap switches and horrible customer service
27	neg	GG, I got played
27	neg	It is what it is
27	neg	Stay away from Logi mice until they decide to actually listen to the hundreds of thousands of people experiencing issues from Logi mice
28	neg	Purchased in September 2019 and and as of April 2020 it is broken
28	neg	The right click will not work correctly when held down which, in a fps game, has caused a ton of issues
28	neg	The buttons for the dpi switch are a seamless transition to the left click which will cause you to accidentally change your dpi in intense situations
28	neg	The mouse has a very lightweight feel which is great and the cable is a braided material which is a nice touch
28	neg	Overall I wouldn’t recommend this product
28	neg	The fact that it died in only 7 months is terrible
28	neg	There are some good qualities but comparing it to the downsides I just can’t recommend that anyone buys it
28	neg	Don’t go with the high reviews, they are all from a short term perspective
29	neg	The mouse started double clicking a few months after first use (like 2 or 3 months)
29	neg	I needed the mouse and decided I could live with it but now (5 months) it's become very bad
29	neg	It double click 90% of the time and it also decides to move a few centimeters every now on then on its own
29	neg	I should have just bought a mx518 from ebay or something, that mouse lasted me 5 years before its decomposition (sticky surface) became unbearable
30	neg	Software didn't behave properly for most of its lifetime (it wouldn't open), just recently did an update fix what issue was causing it
30	neg	As for the product itself, I use it lightly on a daily basis and yet, I've come across the same issue many others have
30	neg	Mouse is double clicking on its own, when I mean to single click
30	neg	Overall, I feel like this mouse is not worth the money at all, I paid less than half for off brand mouse with better quality and longer lifespan (~2 years before being replaced by this one)
30	neg	In a you get what you pay for manner, I understandably replaced my previous chinese offbrand mouse with this new logitech mouse
30	neg	The sensor is great tho
31	neg	This mouse is extremely comfortable, unfortunately I'm in the process of filing a warranty claim for a second replacement
31	neg	The ghost click/double click issue has affected my original purchase, and the replacement, and I expect it to affect any additional replacements issued
31	neg	When I am out of the warranty period and they will no longer provide replacements, I will find another brand
31	neg	The first replacement was no hassle - describe issue and sent a new one out
31	neg	The second has been a nightmare
31	neg	I have spent hours jumping through hoops to document the issue even though it's widely publicized
31	neg	I have gone so far as to recording a video of the issue with the mouse and serial number in the screen and it was still met with disbelief and hassle
31	neg	I was told that a ticket number, which was not provided, was not in the video
31	neg	After clearing my desk to have several different attempts at this video, I have attempted to contact supervisors to no avail
31	neg	I am not sure if logitech will end up sending a replacement, but it is extremely disappointing to see their lack of support for widely defective products and refusal to honor warranty claims
31	neg	I'd advise not to purchase any logitech products and I have heard similar issues with their other peripherals
32	neg	When I got the mouse, I figured it would just take some period of adjustment
32	neg	Well here I am, outside of the return window, still not "adjusted' to the mouse's shape and size
32	neg	The mouse is just too small, I don't have particularly big hands, if anything they're average sized
32	neg	I cannot find a comfortable grip of this mouse
32	neg	When I place my hand how it most naturally fits on the mouse, the extra buttons are out of reach
32	neg	When I put my whole hand on the mouse (so that the top of my palm touches), my fingers extend over the extra buttons so I have to awkwardly press them with my joints
32	neg	The profile feature of the mouse is nice, with different sets of DPI adjustments for switching between shooters and casual browsing
32	neg	The mouse is mechanically nice, the buttons feel good and don't feel cheap, but the shape of the mouse is wrong
32	neg	Ultimately what I'm looking for in a mouse  is comfort during use and I did not find it here
32	neg	If you have small hands go for it, otherwise, assess other options
33	pos	I'd heard people preaching how good the G502 was for quite awhile, but I was hesitant to try it
33	pos	Maybe it's the aesthetic or the fact that I usually prefer mice with more buttons (I play a lot of MMOs) but I tried a lot of alternatives before I finally decided to give in an try the G502, but boy do I wish I had just done so sooner
33	pos	After having used the Logitech G Pro mouse for the last year, I decided I was ready to try something different
33	pos	Don't get me wrong, the Pro is a great mouse, but it's very lightweight which I didn't find terribly comfortable to use (it makes sense in the Pro gamer context, though, so I get it
33	pos	) The G502 is perfect
33	pos	It's hefty, and you can customize it using the weights
33	pos	The button placement is nearly perfect (I find the thumb button a tad hard to reach for my hands) and, like the Pro, the Hero engine is incredibly accurate and satisfying to use
33	pos	I've ended up using it as my all day mouse, even for work, as it's just so pleasant in the hand
33	pos	If you're looking for a great mouse at a very reasonable price point, give the G502 a try
33	pos	(There's also a wireless version available now, but it's considerably more expensive at time of writing
33	pos	)
34	neg	This mouse is fantastic
34	neg	It's sturdy, it's comfortable, the laser is amazing and never skips around
34	neg	If it's too expensive for you just go with the G203
34	neg	I believe they have the same tech on the inside but just fewer bells and whistles
34	neg	I own both and they are both fantastic
34	neg	Edit to review:After just a few months, both right and left mouse clickers are malfunctioning
34	neg	The left one double clicks almost every time I click it (already attempted several "fixes" but it appears to be the hardware as nothing the all knowing google has to suggest has worked) and the left one will not maintain a click when I hold it down (for games such as Call of Duty this is detrimental as I am unable to maintain a zoom in with scopes)
34	neg	Because of this, I am lowering my 5-star review to 2 stars
34	neg	This should happen
34	neg	I would expect this type of issue from some off brand Chinese sweat-shop mouse
34	neg	I expect much more from Logitech
35	neg	This is my 5th g502, the previous 4 all came down with stuttery button issues that everyone has, and trust me they all WILL do this given enough time and use
35	neg	In the past Logitech made good mice that lasted so long I would wear a hole through the left button before it developed any problems but now I don't even have them last long enough to need teflon tape on the feet, they get the click problem anywhere from 2 to 6 months and need to be replaced
35	neg	If there was another mouse that worked as well and fit my hand just right I'd love to stop throwing g502's  in the landfill but I haven't found it yet
35	neg	Buy it on sale and make sure you buy two so you have a spare when the button goes south
36	neg	Logitech used to be pretty good back in the day
36	neg	The only reason this is getting 2-stars and not 1 is because while it worked, it was a good design
36	neg	I use this mouse for standard daily work and light gamming
36	neg	I've had this mouse for just over a year and a half (and another Logitech trackball previously)
36	neg	Just like my previous Logitech hardware, the buttons are sub-par
36	neg	When it was working correctly, I enjoyed using this mouse
36	neg	It has buttons place where they are easily used "reachable" and worked pretty well for what I intended
36	neg	However, it is having the same "press the left mouse button once it automatically double clicks issue" that my previous trackball developed
36	neg	I believe this is an ongoing (YEARS) issue with Logitech and their particular buttons
36	neg	I ordered a similar mouse form another manufacturer
36	neg	Hopefully, it will be better than this
36	neg	This was my last Logitech purchase
36	neg	I have a much cheaper mouse (Redragon, with less buttons) that has taken way more abuse than this mouse and still works perfectly
37	pos	There are 3 buttons that are dpi adjusters on this beast out of the box
37	pos	In order to be able to use them for console (at least for xbox) for anything other than dpi adjustment, you will need to download the Logitech program on a computer and re-map those buttons
37	pos	I found some videos for it on youtube but long story short, you will need to map those 3 dpi buttons to another button on the keyboard that you don't use for gaming
37	pos	Once you've done that, go to the mouse and keyboard button mapping settings on whatever game you are playing and map those random keyboard buttons that you set the dpi buttons to, to whatever you actions you want it to complete
37	pos	For example, if you want the dpi increase button to be "reload", on your computer, map that dpi increase button to, let's say, "["
37	pos	Then open up your game settings on your console and map "reload" to "["
37	pos	Then when you press the dpi increase button on your mouse, the console will think you are clicking "[", and your ge will recognize "[" as how you want to reload and will reload
37	pos	The YouTube videos are probably easier to understand, but hey, I tried
37	pos	Hopefully this points at least one person in the right direction
38	pos	First off, 11 programmable buttons + Gshift
38	pos	If you dont know what Gshift is, its like rolling your hotkeys in MMORPGS
38	pos	This  pairs great with games that demand more marcos with games like BDO, SCUM, and all the other titles that have a bit more commands
38	pos	I couldn't do this with my Corsair Glaive Pro and tbh, spending $60 then compared to this made me regret everything
38	pos	The program that comes with this mouse is foreign at first, but in the end, gets simple to use
38	pos	I have both the Ique (Corsiar keyboard) paired with this mouse and both run great with each other
38	pos	This app like the ique (program for corsair), can both pair games to profile, so as you launch the game, it switches to that specific profile without you having to change the macros all the time
38	pos	I personally dont like the looks, but the utility of this mouse, makes me love the heck out of this
38	pos	If you are looking for the best under $50 gaming mouse, this has to the the top pick in my opinion
38	pos	Do yourself a favor when you bu this mouse - learn it, and learn about all the different things you can do it with
38	pos	Trust me its worth knowing the hundreds of different configs and things you can do with this mouse and the program together
39	pos	I am writing this after having the mouse a day and a half, so things may change
39	pos	So far this mouse is working great for me both in Linux and Windows as I am using it through a KVM
39	pos	My previous older gaming mouse had a few different limitations that really stuck out once I went up to higher resolution and could more consistently hold higher frame rates
39	pos	Basically at the higher display capabilities my old mouse movements looks rather stuttery and jerky
39	pos	This mouse has solved this with some rather quick and easy tuning
39	pos	So for a run down on how this has improved over an older generation gaming mouse is:1
39	pos	Turned down mouse sensitivity in Windows, Linux, and in games
39	pos	At the same time turned up DPI resolution on the mouse
39	pos	The main thing you are really after is turning off "mouse acceleration"
39	pos	The difference in smoothness is night and day
39	pos	I simply did not have the mouse resolution and responsiveness before, at least for first person shooters
39	pos	With this mouse and a few quick tweaks I do
39	pos	2
39	pos	Can run this mouse on smoother, very low static friction free surfaces
39	pos	My older gaming mouse just did not have the sensor for this, so it would stick on the mouse pad a little and then the movement would be a little jerky as it transitioned to kinetic friction
39	pos	This mouse can do it, so problem solved
39	pos	3
39	pos	This mouse allows balancing with weights
39	pos	I guesstimated where I thought I needed the weights and so far it is working out pretty nice
39	pos	The previous gaming mouse had a wireless option with a battery in the back and especially with my big hands not making much contact with the back of the mouse, this would cause things to shift around and not track quite right
39	pos	For my recommendations to get the most out of Linux is to:1
39	pos	Setup under Windows
39	pos	The mouse has a memory, so once it is setup under Windows, it is setup everywhere in terms of DPI settings and polling rate
39	pos	2
39	pos	In Linux (I am doing this under Ubuntu 18
39	pos	04, but should work with any distro) first order of business is to disable acceleration
39	pos	Create the file: /etc/X11/xorg
39	pos	conf
39	pos	d/50-mouse-acceleration
39	pos	confand enter in the following:Section "InputClass"  Identifier "My Mouse"  Driver "libinput"  MatchIsPointer "yes"  Option "AccelProfile" "flat"  Option "AccelSpeed" "0"EndSection3
39	pos	Restart your X server by logging out and back in
39	pos	4
39	pos	Make mouse adjustments such as sensitivity levels in X windows and in games and enjoy
39	pos	The main games to benefit from this are FPS (first person shooter) games
39	pos	Other games any old mouse will do, but it wasn't those games that pushed you to get this mouse, right
39	pos	As a summary, even within a few hours of having this mouse I am finding that I am not getting nauseous as much with FPS gaming, movement looks a lot smoother, and I am quickly getting in a lot more shots and especially a lot more sniping head shots
39	pos	Even in a window manager doing things like grabbing the edge of a window to move it around is a lot easier now
39	pos	While some may debate whether this mouse is as good as another mouse currently on the market, at least going from an older generation gaming mouse to this one is a big improvement
39	pos	I suppose my only qualm so far is I fired up the utility in Windows to configure it where Linux is my primary OS
39	pos	Also while some people say DPI does not matter, it seems like it helps when you turn off mouse acceleration and then use higher DPI resolutions to compensate along with a good polling rate
39	pos	I would consider the result from this mouse once finding the right settings to be "perfect tracking"
40	pos	As an entry level gaming mouse it's decent
40	pos	I've tried maybe 5 different brands, my favorite being the Mad Catz
40	pos	I switched to Logitech over others like Corsair due to the size and the features
40	pos	I have large hands and I claw grip my mouse
40	pos	Logitech fits my hand better
40	pos	It's cheap, however
40	pos	Two have failed on me in under a year
40	pos	In both cases the scroll wheel
40	pos	And in the second case the left mouse button
40	pos	I'll be going back to Mad Catz now that they fixed their quality issues
40	pos	But I'm not complaining, Logitech is decent, cheap - and replaceable
40	pos	One comment on the G HUB software
40	pos	I think it's over complicated for mouse only
40	pos	Others' may be better or worse, I don't know
40	pos	I don't tend to save macros or do any custom programming
40	pos	I prefer to just change dpi and the LED
40	pos	And it's designed a suite so it's overkill for one piece of hardware I think and I'd rather just do without it
41	pos	I needed to replace my 11 year old G500 mouse due to wire issues
41	pos	This G502 is quite similar in design and feel
41	pos	I use it mostly for general computer use and only occasional gaming
41	pos	But there is one flaw in the design of the G502 for me
41	pos	the speed of movement (DPI setting) button for "faster" is located so close to the left click button that I am consantly tripping it accidentally as I work
41	pos	Suddenly, the cursor is flying across the screen so fast I can't find it and I have to stop and hit the "slower" button to return to the speed I want
41	pos	I never had this problem with the G500 because the speed buttons were lower down the side of the mouse and never were activated by mistake
41	pos	I do like that the extra buttons work without having to install the mouse software
41	pos	The software does add extra customization capability, but I do not need it for my uses
41	pos	Overall, I recommend this mouse
41	pos	It is well built and feels like it will last a long time
41	pos	I just hope I can train myself to not accidentally hit that poorly placed DPI button
42	pos	I really like this mouse
42	pos	I added all the included weights and it gives the mouse a very solid feel
42	pos	It's comfortable and well designed
42	pos	I hooked up to my existing Logitech Gaming Software and replaced my old mouse importing the custom profiles perfectly
42	pos	All I needed to do was adjust the DPI to my liking
42	pos	But I also purchased a new keyboard and had to install the G Hub software because the the Gaming Software was just too old and didn't support the new kb
42	pos	The G Hub wares replaces the old Gaming Software and this is where the problems started
42	pos	The G Hub software is horrible
42	pos	Seriously, just do a quick Google search and you'll see a LOT of complaints about it
42	pos	It took all day to figure it out and create new profiles and make it recognize games
42	pos	No help could be found on the Logitech site and Google offered little help
42	pos	Eventually I was able to make everything work as I wanted but it was a frustrating day
42	pos	Final comment, this mouse is great and I recommend it
42	pos	But the G Hub software should be avoided if you can
42	pos	If you do not already own Logitech gear, look elsewhere
43	pos	Let me start by saying i've been through almost every mouse trying to find the one
43	pos	I needed one that was heavy, thick, had lots of buttons and was solid
43	pos	Corsair has constantly let me down with going through over 9 mice in just under three years between two people on several rigs
43	pos	Razer is usually overpriced and doesn't feel that great
43	pos	Logitech comes in clutch
43	pos	This thing is built like a tank
43	pos	It's heavy
43	pos	It's solid
43	pos	It has tons of program options, and the software is a joy to work with
43	pos	The RGB LEDs are fully programable
43	pos	The cable feels pretty solid
43	pos	It's accurate
43	pos	The control of the mouse is great
43	pos	Three clickers is the new norm
43	pos	Getting used to it takes about two to three days, but when you do, its like wow, why didn't we normalize this sooner
43	pos	I play league and wow, genshin impact, stardew valley, and almost any survival horror game that comes out
43	pos	Works great for everything
43	pos	As well I use this in my recording studio as my macro mighty mouse
43	pos	Keybinding things on the go for quick and easy access
43	pos	Again, works great
43	pos	10/10This is far superiors to any other mmo mouse out IMO
43	pos	My only gripe is because its so big, and if you have little hands, you might get some wrist, hand cramps
43	pos	If I game for 10+ hours it really starts to become an issue
43	pos	So take that for what you will
43	pos	This isn't just the logitech, all big mice do it
43	pos	Just know that its fat and thiccc, and feels amazing
43	pos	Just too much of an amazing thing can sometimes get to be a bother
44	pos	I've had the mouse for a little while now
44	pos	First, I want to say that if you're on the fence about this mouse, then just go for it
44	pos	It's a great mouse
44	pos	Pros:Removable weights allow you to customize how hefty it is in hand
44	pos	I added all the weights and enjoy it being a heavier mouse
44	pos	DPI settings are great
44	pos	Really let's you set your sensitivity level and quickly make changes to it based on what you're doing
44	pos	Customizable lighting
44	pos	You will need to download the app, but you can change the lighting to what color you want and also how it lights up or reacts to sound
44	pos	Ergonomics
44	pos	This mouse feels great in the hand
44	pos	I have large hands and it still feels great to me
44	pos	The grips and textures compliment your hand quite well and I've not had any issues with it
44	pos	Cons:DPI buttons are a little too close to the left mouse button
44	pos	This has caused me to inadvertently change DPI settings a few times
44	pos	It's easy and fast to switch back, but can be annoying
44	pos	Width
44	pos	As noted, I have large hands
44	pos	So this may only apply to others like me
44	pos	I feel this mouse could be wider for a better fill of my hand
44	pos	However, it might be too much for others with smaller hands
44	pos	Overall, the negatives are minimal at best
44	pos	This has been an amazing mouse so far and I'm really enjoying it
45	pos	Pros:Solid sensor, good programmable button options, software worked well on Windows 10 and Mac OSX
45	pos	Wired, so no dealing with batteries, chargers, connections, or lag
45	pos	The rubber on the side grips feels good
45	pos	Settings can be saved to onboard memory, so the color and speed and button tweaks work on any machine, not just ones with the driver and your profile installed, unlike Razor
45	pos	Cons:Feels light/cheap even with the added weights, like every piece of plastic was as thin as they could make it without it shattering during shipping
45	pos	The scroll wheel wobbles just slightly left and right (it is supposed to move left right when pushed, but I mean just by moving the mouse on the desk, the wheel flops a 1/2 millimeter back and forth, causing a distracting rattle
45	pos	It does it less when you turn off freewheel and use clicky wheel, but it's still audible there, too
45	pos	Some settings don't seem to be editable in onboard memory, you have to download the profile, update it there, then re-upload it
45	pos	Wouldn't be a big deal, but you can't even view the button customizations without downloading, it just tells you how many buttons were programmed, not what they do
45	pos	Not built for large hands - feels 80% of normal size
45	pos	For example my thumb can't rest in the thumb slot below the two side buttons; with my thumb resting against the bottom of the groove, the top of my thumb is still against the two top buttons, not nestled into the recess below them
46	neg	Bought it thinking I was getting a good deal since it was on sale for $40 at the time of purchase
46	neg	As it would be a good replacement after the micro switches in my G9x died
46	neg	The profile is bit high and it kind of hurts my index finger, its as if my index and middle fingers are slightly extended
46	neg	I'm not sure if I have a defective product but the mouse wheel is off balanced
46	neg	If you slowly move the mouse wheel up in increments (as if you're browsing a webpage), the wheel will slightly rock backwards
46	neg	At first I thought it was some kind of issue with the scroll bar in my browser, spent a good evening trying to locate a bug in Chrome that didn't exist, and it was the mouse wheel the entire time
46	neg	Looked up the issue online and apparently this is a common production flaw with the G502 series
46	neg	The only real fix is to buy a replacement mouse wheel but for G500/G500s and swap it in
46	neg	If you're shopping around for a Logitech mouse, please try and avoid any mice with this mouse wheel type
46	neg	Furthermore, having to use G Hub to program the mouse is an absolute nightmare of an experience, honestly I think I hated having to use that software than the issue with the mouse wheel
46	neg	Save yourself the frustration, anger, and rage and download the Logitech Gaming Software 9
46	neg	02
46	neg	65
46	neg	Hope this helps and happy shopping
47	neg	WARNING, This product to function correctly requires you to install literal spyware
47	neg	It requires Logitech G-hub and Gaming framework
47	neg	Why does my mouse require a 100% Uptime Service running in the backround
47	neg	Data collection pure and simple
47	neg	IN order to sue this mouse you must install the software and service
47	neg	When you install and run this software to use your mouse, you agree to give the following data to logitech
47	neg	-Location information and IP address ( Yes, they need to know your geographical location to use a mouse)-Data related to the discovery of devices you connect, like a new Logitech G mouse or keyboard (Oh nice, they see everything you plug into your computer)-Other device and system activity including feature usage, performance metrics, errors, crash data, etc
47	neg	(Holy hell the ECT
47	neg	This alone gives them full access to essentially everything on your system, what games you play, when you play them, who you login under, every error you get, everytime you restart
47	neg	IT DOES NOT MATTER, IF ITS ON YOUR PC ITS BEING LOGGED AND HANDED TO LOGITECH)Other then that, the mouse functions, Besides the DOUBLEC CLICK
47	neg	Or the Stick Left clickmaybe the Left click that clicks, but does not do anything, then you have to really press it in and it registers, or tap your finger on a different spot
48	pos	(BACKSTORY)I actually owned this mouse before, the only difference is that I purchased it from a different vendor (Gamestop) and during the same day I was already having an issue with my right click button being "sticky", and after some time I had issues with the left switch staying pressed and was even causing double-click issues
48	pos	I attempted to fix this problem by ordering some new switches as a replacement, unfortunately de-soldering the switches themselves proved to be a very time-consuming since no matter how much solder I was able to remove using both the solder pen and the solder wick, the old switches would just not let go
48	pos	After using some (unfortunate) force I was able to pry the left switch out, but I was worried I had to go through a brutish process just to do so before I was able to finally solder the new switch in place
48	pos	Upon putting everything back together I was however already met with some bad news, not only did the LED for the product logo stop function, but so did my scroll wheel, I attempted to fix the latter issue myself but have achieved no success, but at the very least the new button was working fine until I was able to get a new copy shipped in (7/31/2021)
48	pos	(END OF BACKSTORY)As of this review date's submission I have not be getting any issues with the mouse, and while the Logitech app reads it to be the model with a 25k sensor it's odd that the (abused) box it came in (with no packaging either besides the box itself) advertises it as the 16k model
48	pos	But overall, and for the time being, the mouse is working great and I even applied some rubber anti-sweat adhesive layers over it which helps me protect the aesthetic quality of the mouse, and even though I thoroughly wash my hands before settling myself back to my computer I still prefer the mouse with the rubber covers concealing the plastic matte finish
48	pos	Now to run my favorite source games and bind some certain commands to my scroll wheel
49	neg	I use programmable mice to speed up programming tasks
49	neg	The programmable buttons on this mouse have weak action and are easy to press by accident
49	neg	The previous logitech mouse I used for years (sadly no longer available) worked much better
49	neg	I would be willing to put up with this inferior replacement for its predecessor except after a couple of weeks it started misbehaving
49	neg	The cursor would start randomly moving
49	neg	The mouse was sending a continual "right" or "up" or other signal to the computer
49	neg	Sometimes the mouse would return to normal use with some vigorous scrolling
49	neg	Sometimes I would have to disconnect/reconnect the USB to get it to work again
49	neg	The final straw was when I accidentally deleted a document when the mouse decided to move just as I was clicking
49	neg	I looked around the internet and apparently this has been a common problem for years that Logitech cannot be bothered to fix
49	neg	I tried seven "solutions" to the problem including new drivers, new firmware, and turning off power saving features
49	neg	Nothing worked
49	neg	I was also sad to see the Logitech, after all these years, is still using the most counter-intuitive app to program the mouse I have ever seen
49	neg	Until Logitech decides that quality is important I am done with their mice
50	neg	I'll preface this by saying I've pretty much been a one-brand guy for the last 10+ years when it comes to computer peripherals - pretty much every mouse, keyboard, and webcam I've purchased since starting to build computers has been a Logitech product
50	neg	This mouse was great
50	neg	while it lasted
50	neg	About 6 months after purchasing, the mouse lost the ability to hold a left-click
50	neg	In other words, you'd click and hold the left mouse button to drag something, but the mouse would let off the hold even though you were still holding the left mouse button down
50	neg	This makes any task that involves dragging and dropping (or drawing something by holding the left mouse button) infuriating if not impossible
50	neg	After reading around, it sounds like it's a known hardware issue with this mouse
50	neg	Unfortunately, Logitech's support answer is to try spraying compressed air in the mouse to clear any debris - this did not work
50	neg	I submitted a support request to Logitech and haven't heard back in a week
50	neg	I certainly won't buy another G502 to replace this one, and I'll have to consider other brands based on this experience
51	neg	This is absolutely the best mouse that I've ever owned
51	neg	But you need to understand that the issues mentioned in review after review are correct and widespread
51	neg	If Logitech were to actually fix these issues, they'd likely have about 99% of the market
51	neg	The issue for mine occurred in the right button and involved double clicks/the button not recognizing being held
51	neg	It was a hardware issue, not a software one as I had a separate Logitech to test the software
51	neg	The mouse button was even tested on two computers as well
51	neg	The same issue has just started to pop up for a friend as well with their system
51	neg	Double clicks/phantom presses/non-consistent presses
51	neg	Save yourself the aggravation and find a more reliable mouse, even if this one will be the best one you'll ever have (until issues pop up)
51	neg	I guess this is why the G502 has been taken off quite a few updated mouse buying guides
52	pos	First thing I noticed, the free spinning of the scroll wheel is completely useless
52	pos	I thought for a moment I was going to have to return the mouse, then realized there's a button to turn off free spin
52	pos	But
52	pos	Then it's super clunky, better, not great
52	pos	Continuing with the scroll wheel, using the associated button is hit or miss
52	pos	I play FPS shooters and this is a button I use often
52	pos	Half the time it seems to not trigger until I let go of pushing it and then the timing is completely off, obviously
52	pos	The three buttons on the left side of the mouse:  I have decent sized hands, I'm 6'1"  I have to reach back with my thumb to get to one of them (most used of course) and this is super uncomfortable
52	pos	There's a sticky area for grip by your thumb that really should have been the place to put the side mouse buttons, they would have been much easier to use
52	pos	The movement seems fine so far
52	pos	The issues really stem from button placement and a VERY horrible scroll wheel
52	pos	I would not get this mouse again even though it's #1 in computer mice category at the time of this review
52	pos	I don't know if I can return it after a couple weeks use, but, I'm going to see
52	pos	For reference, I came from a Logitech MX518 and wanted more buttons which is what brought me to this mouse
53	neg	I am so very disappointed with this mouse, so-called one of the best gamer mouse at the moment
53	neg	I couldn't stand using it for more than an hour, and had to switch back to my cheap, 6-year-old, discontinued, MSI Interceptor DS200
53	neg	I wish I've done more research before buying and did not get carried away with the gamer community reviews
53	neg	There are two main reasons for me not liking this mouse: the wheel (which is poorly designed in many ways) and the Logitech software
53	neg	In almost every other aspect the mouse is very good
53	neg	It looks great, very comfortable for the hand, and the thumb button setup is just perfect
53	neg	THE WHEEL, OMG THE WHEEL
53	neg	How a little part can be so flawed to totally ruin the experience
53	neg	The very first thing you will notice when you unbox the mouse is that the wheel is released and will spin freely
53	neg	After freaking out for a second you will also notice that there is a button that will lock the wheel allowing for the use we all like and need
53	neg	However, there are three problems with the locked wheel: The first is that it is extremely noisy, more than you can imagine
53	neg	The second is that it does not scroll easily, the movement is not smooth at all
53	neg	And the third is that the wheel is made of metal, which causes your finger to slide occasionally (when the wheel is locked) and miss a few scrolls, which is a big flaw
53	neg	And finally, there is the rattling sound
53	neg	As soon as you start moving the mouse with moderate speed you will feel like something is loose in the inside
53	neg	It is the wheel, again, moving from side to side, clashing against the plastic, and this is very, very annoying
53	neg	There are some YouTube tutorials that teach you how to stick a tape on the side to prevent the rattling
53	neg	Although I'm not into cheap hacks to my new hardware I was about to accept all these flaws and try to get used to them as soon as possible
53	neg	But then I met the Logitech software problem
53	neg	LOGITECH VS LOGITECHI have a Logitech G910 keyboard which I love and I have been using for quite some time, along with the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS)
53	neg	The LGS is supposed to detect your Logitech hardware and let you configure all of them from one place
53	neg	However, despite my efforts LGS never detected my G502 mouse
53	neg	That left me no choice but to download and install G-Hub, a newer Logitech software that is supposed to be better than LGS
53	neg	But it's not, It's actually much worse, although it did detect my keyboard and my mouse
53	neg	G-Hub is poorly designed, it is bugged and it is missing many cool features that LGS had, making a hassle out of the simpler tasks like coloring your keyboard for a specific game, or keeping a custom default DPI for the mouse
53	neg	Also, the import feature for your LGS profiles is just broken
53	neg	G-Hub wont import anything and you will lose all your LGS customizations and macros
53	neg	Ok, I thought: maybe I can use G-Hub for the mouse and LGS for the keyboard
53	neg	Nope, Logitech wont let you use both, and as soon as you install G-Hub it will block LGS
53	neg	I was not keen to ruin my experience with the G-910 in order to use a flawed mouse, so I decided I will not use the G502 for now
53	neg	I live outside of the US and getting a refund is not an option
53	neg	Besides, the mouse is not broken, it's just flawed by design
54	pos	So, this mouse is really good for what it's supposed to do, which is be a mouse
54	pos	It responds well, I haven't had any of the issues I normally do with other brands such as Corsair, like buttons not responding, registering 2 clicks when it was only one, the wheel giving out or just generally dying after a few months
54	pos	But at the same time the design is frankly, just weird
54	pos	The left click button is on the thin side, which I never seem to have an issue with having thin fingers myself
54	pos	But right beside the left click button are 2 buttons that will adjust the speed of your pointer on screen and these 2 buttons are entirely too easy to misclick with even the slightest shift of your finger
54	pos	You can adjust the speed the pointer changes too with each click on the logitec app, but I cannot seem to get the fastest button to go below 3000 dpi, the app simply stops at that number and won't go below it, so I go from my standard slow mouse speed, that I love to one that shoots my pointer across the screen so fast I can't find it half the time
54	pos	Causing a lot of unnecessary and aggravating deaths or stealth breaks
54	pos	I would buy this mouse again, but it would have to be without those 2 buttons, or at least have a function on the app that doesn't force me into an insane dpi
55	neg	This Logitech G502 Hero mouse is garbage
55	neg	I own three and within 6-9 months of light-to-moderate use in a climate-controlled room, all three now consistently double-click on a single press, or release the click while I’m still holding the button down
55	neg	This makes FPS games impossible as releasing the right mouse button will un-scope my ranged weapon
55	neg	For regular use, accidental double clicks will open files or links I didn’t intend to
55	neg	I have accidentally opened a few folders, only to have to use my keyboard to go back safely
55	neg	A gaming mouse only has two real functions: tracking movements (this mouse did this well), and clicking properly (frustratingly bad)
55	neg	I’ve since replaced all three with Corsair mice for less cost, and those mice’s buttons are rated in the millions of clicks
55	neg	I will not purchase Logitech again
56	neg	The mouse feels great, just like my 6 year old g502 that finally bit the bullet on me
56	neg	Good weight, good cable, scrolling and buttons all feel good
56	neg	The one huge giant issue I've already run into in my first week of owning it is the new version of the horrible "G HUB" software
56	neg	It constantly ignores my profile and button assignments
56	neg	I have the mouse set to use 400 dpi with all profile switching and DPI switching buttons disabled
56	neg	At least once a day I need to un plug and re plug in my mouse as it seems to go to the default 1200 dpi, and ignores all my configured buttons
56	neg	This alone really makes the mouse feel like a huge pain in the butt, and a real step down from the previous model
56	neg	I hope this gets fixed in the near future, because I don't see myself sticking out with these annoying problems for another 5 years
57	neg	For an item that supposedly lists for $100 retail, this thig really has some seriously poor quality workmanship and materials: The mouse wheel is made of some cheap plastic with NO rubber or layer of grip that will provide traction for your finger when scrolling and especially when attempting to use the left and right wheel buttons, my finger just slides right off
57	neg	The mechanical aspects of the wheel also are very poor, as the "free wheel" and the "resistance mode" of the mouse feel pretty much the same, resistance mode I can almost free spin the mouse to the same extent of free wheel
57	neg	Added to the fact that it just feels clunky, loose, and wobbles around making a rattling sound when Im using it
57	neg	I was feeling more like the mouse wheel was made for some $3 trash mouse you would buy in a swap meet and they just threw it in there
57	neg	I dont know exactly what it was about the design, but from the first moment I used it, it just felt wrong in my hand
57	neg	Perhaps it was just some small aspect of how they designed the body but it really felt like the fit was just off
57	neg	The programable buttons were decent, and the software was pretty easy to figure out and worked fine, the only issue I had with it was that some of the games I have installed, very popular games, it would not recognize on a search and I had to add them in manually
57	neg	They could also start using optical switches for the main buttons which would make me feel better about the longevity and accuracy of the item as well
57	neg	Considering their closest competitor has made a product without these glaring flaws it may behoove Logitech to get on the ball and make some serious design changes
57	neg	Im sending this one back
58	neg	I got this to attempt to replace my wonderful, but old and failing, Logitech G700s mouse
58	neg	It has fewer buttons and they are arranged differently from the 700s model
58	neg	I use it for productivity and not gaming, so the buttons are for copying, deleting and moving around web pages
58	neg	The 2 by 2 side buttons of the G700s are perfect for my hand and the left top row of buttons is perfect for page up and down scrolling
58	neg	This G520 has three side buttons instead of four which are spaced in an "L" shape instead of a rectangle of two and two
58	neg	It has the same three top, left edge buttons, but they are spaced further apart with less tactile feel
58	neg	This model suffers from a design or manufacturing flaw
58	neg	It has a replaceable bottom plate that covers a recessed area where you can install thin pieces of metal to change the weight of the mouse
58	neg	The design or manufacture of this unit made the bottom plate sit higher than the rest of the mouse
58	neg	So when you press one of the main buttons, the mouse rocks forward and then back
58	neg	That causes the laser tracker to move your cursor
58	neg	So you point and click, but the mouse moves the cursor a little, so you miss your target
58	neg	Removing and keeping the bottom plate off allows the mouse to work just fine
58	neg	The weights are friction fit, so they stay in place
58	neg	I'm afraid to bump the mouse too hard, though, as that might dislodge one or more of the weights
58	neg	The Logitech Gaming Software works well enough but is not intuitive or easy to master for productivity
58	neg	It seems the manufacturers of mice aren't aware that multi-button mice are being used for productivity as well as gaming
58	neg	I marked it down one star for the software and button arrangement, and down two more stars for the bottom plate defect
59	neg	The media could not be loaded
59	neg	Hype and marketing aside, this mouse has serious flaws, immediate quality control ones as well as general design ones
59	neg	The BAD:This mouse doesn’t glide side-to-side or up-and-down as much as it scratches and grinds all over the place
59	neg	Issue here is the new and NOT improved weight system
59	neg	Unlike the old push-of-a-button slide out tray on G500, the boomerang shaped weights need to be wedged into the bottom of the mouse once you pop the side corner and peel off the underside
59	neg	(By the way, this is completely counter intuitive and not mentioned in the tiny sheet of a paper that passes for a “manual”
59	neg	Instead you are supposed to find an official YouTube video by Logitech describing the procedure
59	neg	What
59	neg	What happened with the button-push system
59	neg	) The entire door is held, barely at that, by a super weak 1g magnet and two tiny plastic latches that seem like a major part endurance oversight
59	neg	(No way they won’t break at some point in the future)
59	neg	As reported on reddit and elsewhere, the mouse underside weights compartment door does not close all the way
59	neg	There is some give and it makes the mouse uneven on the bottom
59	neg	That said, even removing the weights AND the door entirely, the mouse will still scratch and grate since the mouse feet elsewhere were positioned unevenly ( There are no feet positioned on right side at all for example, which makes the mouse uneven door-issue-aside
59	neg	)
59	neg	All of this can be mitigated by not using the G502 on a hard surface like wood, glass, or those new “pro-gamer” plastic or metal pads
59	neg	But even on a cloth mat after a few hours there were tracks and tiny rips in the cloth material
59	neg	Wow, Logitech
59	neg	How the mighty have fallen
59	neg	Another issue is plastic
59	neg	Cheap plastic everywhere that is
59	neg	Nowadays even never-heard-of-brands making “Cool Gamer RGB overload” mice for $10-$15 come with rubberized coating
59	neg	Other than the side grips, the entirety of G502 is cheap slick plastic which will make the mouse slide around… well, grind around let’s be honest
59	neg	Also, it has been shrunken in all possible dimensions compared to G500
59	neg	It is narrower, shorter and much lower than the G500
59	neg	Seems like something designed for your average teenage/tween hand, which I’m sure is the target demographic now anyway
59	neg	All in all, all of the above can explained by down-costing
59	neg	This mouse (G502) screams “cut-costs”, for the manufacturer that is
59	neg	You, the user, are still expected to pay 2 to 2
59	neg	5 times as much as you did for the G5 or G500 10-15 years ago while getting something much inferior
59	neg	Smaller, more plasticky with horrible QC and design decisions
59	neg	(The underside of the mouse does not shut clean making the bottom of the mouse uneven
59	neg	How was this overlooked
59	neg	And then made by the million
59	neg	)The GOOD:The sensor is top notch
59	neg	While not majorly improved, the increase in precision is noticeable and measurable vs G500 for instance
59	neg	Jitter is lower and bizarre acceleration issues seem to be non-existent on G502
59	neg	Cord is pretty nice
59	neg	Extremely flexible and seems to be of high quality
59	neg	Something easily frayed G500 cord could have used
59	neg	Logitech software is still intuitive, relatively low resource, and available in most common language including English
59	neg	Summary:Downcosted all around, overly plasticky, poor quality control, worse than poor design choices, lack of rubberized coating where needed, shrunken, shrunken, tiny, TINY, mouse
59	neg	10 years ago this would have been a… well, still a downgrade to a G500, but not many options were as available back then, so it might have been an option of some  kind
59	neg	Now, even no-name “Gamer-Cool” brands come with decent enough software, (macros, RGB configurability, profiles, DPI tweaking and all), rubberized coating, latest Pixart sensors, weight systems, you name it, all for under $20, sometimes even for under $15
59	neg	It seems the no-names have gotten a bit better, if not a whole lot better and name brands like Logitech have gotten a bit worse and down-costed to the absolute maximum, so now everything sits in the middle and luck-of-the-draw is what rules the day and the mouse pad
59	neg	I would say G502 is on par with your average random $15 no-name brand “Gamer-Cool” mouse on Amazon, but even those have rubberized coating, proper height and size for a grown man’s hand, and actual metal feet
59	neg	How the mighty have fallen
60	pos	Been using Logitech mice for decades, love the features, the customization, the utility, the ergonomics, & this mouse does well in most of those categories
60	pos	But, for me anyway, for my uses it has a major flaw: It's kind of small, so anyone who uses a Palm Mouse Grip will find it uncomfortable
60	pos	To explain, my previous mouse on my main gaming desktop was a Logitech G700, & that mouse is large enough that my hand "sits" on it, so during my gaming sessions my hand can "rest" on top of it
60	pos	That factor comes into play during long/er gaming sessions, because to a large degree it majorly reduces hand fatigue & maximizes comfort
60	pos	A larger mouse fills up your hand, which enables you to not have to adopt an unnatural hand position to grip it, because having to adjust your hand in order to grip your mouse correctly or press the side buttons makes your hand tired, & more importantly, contributes to carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms
60	pos	But this mouse is small/er, so I have to use a modified Claw Grip on it, & using that grip makes me hand hurt
60	pos	I've used Palm Grip gaming mice for so long, I may be able to adjust somewhat to using Claw Grip mouse, but the whole reason I stopped using Claw Grip mice is because it gave me hand pain & carpal tunnel
60	pos	I'm disappointed because I really like the RGB & the features of the new Logitech 'G' software, but I will most likely be returning this mouse
61	neg	I wanted to like this mouse
61	neg	I like the position of the buttons (particularly the toggle DPI that lets you have a "snipe" button - more mice need that) and the general shape of the mouse, but it's just got so many problems, including abysmal build quality (which is shocking for logitech)For starters, it's weirdly draggy and a bit heavy, even wired and with zero weights in it
61	neg	I can't see anyone wanting to add more of the included weights - the point of this kind of mouse is to start LIGHT and let you tune it, not start heavy and let you make it worse
61	neg	Genuinely heavier than my full size WIRELESS teknet mouse that I use for my media PC
61	neg	The feet lasted okay, they're starting to feel worn after a year of use on an aluminum banshee pad mousepad (I usually got about 2-3 years out of a set of feet on a Razer Deathadder) And they're very sensitive to picking up schmutz
61	neg	Replacement feet are not readily found, you're gonna be using teflon tape
61	neg	The combination of really meh feet and really heavy/draggy weight makes the mouse wildly imprecise after only a couple months
61	neg	Even with teflon tape over the feet, I still can't make a "clean" drag across my mousepad with a smooth cursor movement
61	neg	Not even sure it would when it was new
61	neg	The  aforementioned teknet mouse still absolutely glides after years
61	neg	I think it's just because the 502 has SIX absolutely gigantic pads, and other mice I use tend to have 3 or 4 much smaller feet at most, which keeps the inherent friction lower
61	neg	Cord is okay if used with a mouse bungie
61	neg	The scroll wheel is abysmal
61	neg	It has a side/side rock, which is already not good for a proper gaming mouse (they all have a habit of mis-registering mouse 3 clicks) but this is easily the worst I've ever experienced
61	neg	I am used to the design, but this one is so bad and vague that I had to straight up disable the rocker, so now I only get about 15% of my middle clicks mis-sensed
61	neg	The ability to unlock a scroll wheel is nice when I have to turbo scroll through a 300 page document, but again, in GAMING practice, is just one more way the scroll wheel feels incredibly vague and inaccurate
61	neg	mouse 4 is just set too far back
61	neg	You have to press it with the knuckle of your thumb, which requires an incredibly awkward "palm pinch"
61	neg	If you use all the mouse buttons in a game, you're going to hate this thing so much
61	neg	And the thing is INCREDIBLY fragile
61	neg	My first one's left click broke just sliding off my chair onto carpet, the whole mouse button itself sheared off
61	neg	The second one's L2 switch itself is now failing, as it registers right click but doesn't register HOLDING it
61	neg	After only a year, this is appalling
61	neg	If you play MMO's, this makes steering an absolute nightmare
61	neg	If you play FPS games, right click iron sight/scope becomes agony
61	neg	And there's something about this mouse that gives me really sweaty palms, which is weird because I have a kind of hybrid palm/fingertip grip that keeps my palm usually hovering just above the mouseMy deathadder was only replaced by this mouse because I suspected the skin flakes embedded in the chassis had evolved a new form of life
61	neg	This one is getting hucked in the garbage because it fell to pieces in a little over a year and a half
61	neg	I am staying away from Logitech for a few years after two absolutely atrocious peripherals and going back to the good old iron duke of a Razer Deathadder
62	neg	I used a Proteus version for a decade
62	neg	It was an amazing mouse, never had issues
62	neg	Had to get a new one and only Hero was available
62	neg	Figured a newer version would be better
62	neg	Wrong
62	neg	Lots of people are plagued by weird "stuttering" on this mouse
62	neg	You can google it and find dozens on dozens of reports of it, with virtually no solutions
62	neg	Just people guessing and trying random things
62	neg	Lots of placebo and then they come back and report the issue came back
62	neg	I've tried all these steps and more:-Reinstalling logitech-uninstalling any and all mouse drivers-disabling any RGB controlling software like Gigabyte RGB Fusion someone claimed messed with it-disable "allow games to control RGB"-Reducing mouse polling rates-Different USB ports-Disabling USB power suspension in Windows 10-Cleaning the sensor-Cleaning the mouse pad-Changing the mouse pad
62	neg	I previously had an acrylic mouse pad
62	neg	Hard surface
62	neg	Logitech G Hub used to have a "tuning" option where you could tinker with settings and calibrate the mouse to that mouse pad
62	neg	Worked great with Proteus
62	neg	Hero doesn't have that and/or Logitech removed the tuning option entirely
62	neg	So this option which possibly would fix the issue is no longer available
62	neg	I bought 2 new mouse pads that I didn't want - soft fabric type and one that is a bit thicker fabric like a traditional mouse pad
62	neg	At first I thought maybe it improved but I still get the issue
62	neg	The mouse will stutter especially if I try to move fast to click something precise, or highlight text
62	neg	I have shaky hands sometimes but this thing looks like I'm taking the mouse off the matt or something
62	neg	Which, interestingly, is a nice way to reproduce the issue
62	neg	If you raise the mouse slightly off the matt, it will exhibit similar stuttering on demand
62	neg	Logitech ceased responding to me when I raised the issue
62	neg	Such a disappointment
63	pos	This mouse is precision
63	pos	Everything works precisely and is accurate
63	pos	Nice to be able to change dpi on the fly
63	pos	Where it shines:  Precision and smooothe sliders make it a snag free accurate mouse, clicky scroll wheelmouse cable never noticed while in use
63	pos	A+++  (don't pay more for wireless)Where it fails:  Size of an animal mouse
63	pos	Might be for a specific type of grip style
63	pos	Cat food style
63	pos	Meaning, it fits fine if you use your pinky and ring finger pads to push into the right side of it
63	pos	I drag my pinky and ring finger very loosely off the right side, on to the mouse pad
63	pos	ANY other grip is PAINFUL
63	pos	If you do not drag your 2 extra fingers on the table, you end up holding them up with nothing to support them underneath
63	pos	That will cause your fingers to wear out quickly, say in 2 minutes
63	pos	I'm NOT SAYING it doesn't work WELL, just that it has extremely limited grip styles
63	pos	I personally prefer for the mouse to support my other fingers
63	pos	I am paying the mouse after all
63	pos	Lazy brat mouse
63	pos	Anyway The G 502 is functionally awesome, ergonomically lacking for large (meaning AVERAGE sized adult MALE) hands
63	pos	to the point I would strongly consider Razer's horrible bloat ware if i were able to try this out before buying it
63	pos	(Basilisk v3 maybe)  It is a good mouse though, nearly perfect, but ya know
63	pos	Not
64	pos	I just cannot figure out why mouse design engineers do not consider the requirement that a mouse needs to be lifted off the pad and repositioned back to where the user's hand/wrist is not in an uncomfortable position
64	pos	Also, what to do when one runs out of mouse pad
64	pos	Why, lift the mouse and bring it back to the middle, of course
64	pos	The G502 is a great mouse except it's difficult to use without activating one of the G4 or G5 buttons, especially when lifting to reposition
64	pos	One of the reasons for this is the sides of the mouse body are too straight up and down which cause ones fingers to slide up
64	pos	Coupled with the thumb scoop area being too small--even in normal use, ones thumb is very close to those buttons-- that in the heat of battle, they're far, far, too easy to accidentally press and, poof, you lost that battle
64	pos	Overall the mouse seems robustly built but I feel that all of the switches activate with too light and too shallow of a press
64	pos	Otherwise, it's a great gaming mouse except the thumb scoop needs to be bigger/deeper
64	pos	Likewise (but to a lesser degree) the finger scoop on the other side of the body
64	pos	Engineers:  Give us something to lift up on
65	neg	Had this mouse for 2 years and for the past year it has been giving problems DAILY
65	neg	When you press and hold a mouse button it will either "release", even though you are continuing to hold the button, or will double click instead of holding
65	neg	This makes selecting text impossible as it resets the initial point of selection
65	neg	I can't copy and paste text with this mouse at all
65	neg	Tried multiple computers - same result
65	neg	Any other mouse - works fine (including cheaper logitech ones)
65	neg	G502 is defective and you can see a lot of videos and read reports of these problems
65	neg	It feels good in the hand, but impossible to use
65	neg	Forget about gaming of any sort since it will not do what you tell it to do
66	neg	Been an avid user of the Logitech G502 wired series for many years
66	neg	The recent versions show a lack of quality in workman ship
66	neg	I have an original Logitech from 8+ years ago, still works 100% of the time
66	neg	I've got 5 broken G502s in the past year that don't last 4-6 months before it starts having quality issues
66	neg	Issues I've encountered:  1) double-click on single for both left and right, rarely at the same time
66	neg	2) Mouse wheel gets stuck in a push (I barely use the mouse wheel as is, but seen it get stuck in the shift function) 3) Mouse wheel keeps spinning after touch (basically, the weight is off and keeps spinning until it corrects where it thinks it wants to be, not where user places wheel)
66	neg	Throwing in a fourth item that is software Logitech GHub focused, not so much on the mouse but is impacted:  4) software updates requires a system reboot and locks all functionality until restarted
66	neg	Like I said, this used to be a great product and well produced
66	neg	If it was 1 out of 5 purchases, I could say maybe a manufacturing defect on that one device
66	neg	Unfortunately, it's been 5 out of 5 over the past two years; I seriously doubt it's a one time bad batch product issue
66	neg	Looking at other gaming mice for future enjoyment
66	neg	Dropping Logitech from future considerations
66	neg	Usage:  standard games from RPGs to FPS; office work
66	neg	Mouse rated for 50M clicks (per Logitech's website), no way I've hit that in 4 months
66	neg	Quick math
66	neg	50M clicks at 1 click per second would require me 578 days of straight clicking to hit
67	neg	I have a G502 on my PC, which I use for work
67	neg	I need different shortcuts on different software and so the G502 works perfectly and the user interface (which has been updated, but I haven’t replaced there) is easy to use
67	neg	I got the Hero thinking it would be great to have the same functionality on my Mac which I’m using more now for work since I’m often on the go
67	neg	Boy was I wrong
67	neg	Let’s start with the software: I installed it easily enough but it wouldn’t recognize the mouse
67	neg	Fine, restarted and it still wouldn’t, uninstalled and reinstalled and restarted before connecting: now it finally did
67	neg	Great, except figuring out how to program the buttons was a pain largely because it was bugging out hard and things wouldn’t show, I only found out after I had to turn my laptop off to go somewhere else and turning it on again
67	neg	Finally, after wasting my lunch and half an afternoon trying to figure it out, I managed to set it up
67	neg	Great
67	neg	Except scrolling was inverted and it would go up when I tried scrolling down and viceversa
67	neg	“Ok, I’ll fix that on settings” there was no option on settings, so I fixed that on Apple configuration
67	neg	Fixed
67	neg	Work time
67	neg	Except when I had to use the trackpad I came to find out now it was invented
67	neg	Cue more time wasted on a solution I could not find
67	neg	Finally I gave up, willing to suck it up and enjoy my shortcuts that change from program to program, that would be dreamy, at least
67	neg	Except it wasn’t, because no sooner had I started enjoying them when they stopped working for no reason
67	neg	So it’s back to troubleshooting
67	neg	More wasted time, more restarts and more reinstalls and setups later and best I would get was a couple hours of work before shortcuts crapped out again
67	neg	I really wanted this to work so I asked for a replacement
67	neg	Same problems
67	neg	I ende up returning it as well
67	neg	Apple users: save your time and money
67	neg	Get something else
68	pos	I don't know how else to say it but this mouse is awesome especially if you have big hands like me
68	pos	I got this mouse as a replacement/holder until I got my corsair mouse back from a replacement I had to make due to a button failing on it (right click)
68	pos	I wanted something that had the same similar style with enough buttons for my MMO games and a thumb rest
68	pos	Long story short, I thought for 40 bucks I was getting a cheaper quality mouse compared to my other one
68	pos	Instead I received a great quality mouse that felt better in my hand and even shocked me with its great remapping software
68	pos	The integrated games mapping is awesome
68	pos	Before I had to go into a game and find the mapping to make a profile on my mouse and remap that to whatever button I wanted
68	pos	With the Logitech software it scans the games and tells you exactly what mappings do what
68	pos	It's kind of hard to explain but it makes things so much easier
68	pos	If you try this out you'll see what I mean
68	pos	Little things like that and the actual quality build of the mouse is why I'm switching from my 90$ mouse to a 40$ mouse as my go to
69	neg	tried as a replacement for my g9
69	neg	first off, i have my g9 at 175g
69	neg	it turns out they only make one mouse that heavy anymore, and i cannot function without that weight as i've been trained for like 15 years with it
69	neg	i don't think the one move is physically possible with this mouse despite higher dpi, as it depends on the mouse floating after flicking its entire weight :\but this one feels super flimsy like, i guess they're not allowed to use good plastic anymore
69	neg	so
69	neg	that was like fine, whatever
69	neg	but it maxes out at 139g
69	neg	like it wouldn't have been hard to add some variation in the weights; this is like a toy mouse and they're all 3
69	neg	6g
69	neg	and they don't all even fit into the base at once in a configuration that balances it properly
69	neg	like there's one configuration they fit as
69	neg	and they don't make other weights in that shape
69	neg	probably because it's a terrible shape
69	neg	anyway, so i'm replacing the microswitches in my g9 as the left click is doubling about 1/10,000 clicks under certain circumstances
69	neg	will update i guess
70	neg	The mouse itself is fairly good, not great
70	neg	but the software (G Hub) Logitech pretty much forces you to use is atrocious
70	neg	I bought it to replace my aging Logitech G700s, which I really liked
70	neg	I prefer how the G700s felt in my hands to this, but that's probably just personal preference
70	neg	The DPI shift button (the button by the thumb) feels too far forward for me, but I probably just need to get used to it
70	neg	My main issue with the mouse itself is that I find myself accidentally clicking the left mouse button pretty often with the G502, so I think buttons are quite a bit lighter/easier to press on this mouse
70	neg	The thing that I really dislike the most about this mouse is  G Hub, the software Logitech pretty much forces you to use if you want to get the most out of the mouse
70	neg	Yes, there is onboard memory for five different profiles, but it's not nearly as convenient to access and change these onboard profiles as it was with the previous Logitech software: Logitech Gaming Software
70	neg	LGS was also faster, used fewer system resources, and more intuitive than G Hub
70	neg	Overall, better in all the ways that count
70	neg	But it looks like Logitech won't let you use the old LGS software with this mouse anymore
70	neg	Overall, I'm pretty displeased with this mouse
70	neg	The only reason I bought it, is because it was on sale
70	neg	Had I known how bad G Hub was, I would have bought something else, even if it cost more
70	neg	My advice, either go with Corsair for a better product, or try Redragon if you want something cheap
71	neg	This is an absolutely fantastic right handed mouse
71	neg	I literally can't find anything else that feels as good as this does on my hand and wrist
71	neg	However, with this model of the g502, they must be having some serious quality issues
71	neg	My mouse's left click started double clicking on every click about two months into ownership
71	neg	I am now using my older model g502 that I had for two years
71	neg	I would have given higher stars had their warranty process been useable
71	neg	I have attempted a warranty claim with the serial number on the mouse multiple times and never get an email back for an RMA
71	neg	Absolutely horrible, convoluted return process that is not meant to be useable (I truly think it's difficult on purpose
71	neg	) I love Logitech's G502, but this model isn't where it's at
72	neg	I ordered this to replace an old and worn out G700s, which was solidly built and only had one major issue with the double clicking
72	neg	This mouse even with the weights added feels very light, much lighter than the G700s
72	neg	It also feels incredibly cheap, especially the scroll wheel which feels very flimsy
72	neg	The scroll wheel is also annoyingly loud when not in frictionless mode
72	neg	It does not have a smooth clicking sound like the G700s, but sounds like its grinding
72	neg	Frictionless mode is really loose scrolling up and down pages, far more than a G700s
72	neg	Ergonomically its smaller than a G700s, sitting much lower and does not feel like any the older G-series mice, forcing me to uncomfortably extend my wrist
72	neg	It seems like it may be better suited for a child
72	neg	The other reviews make me question if I got the real thing
72	neg	Amazon can be like Russian roulette on hardware
72	neg	If this is a legit Logitech product, I am not happy
72	neg	I have bought Logitech gaming mice for over a decade and this is the first one where it felt cheap, was ergonomically off, and had a scroll wheel that sounded like it was grinding
72	neg	None of the others, I have bought several over the years, were like this
73	pos	First off, I'm biased
73	pos	I've been using the Proteus Core version for 2-3 years
73	pos	Bought back when they were in the $100 range
73	pos	Loved the mouse
73	pos	So naturally its hard not to go for the updated version for $41 since mine is getting ragged
73	pos	Saw that the special edition was $29 but not digging the black and white scheme
73	pos	Much rather have the all black and since that was the only difference, I paid the extra $12 for the regular version
73	pos	Weird
73	pos	Honestly I really wanted to go to a the wireless G502 but since its literally a $110 up charge ($41 vs $149) for being cordless, theres no way
73	pos	Shame on you Logitech for being ridiculous in your cordless pricing
73	pos	Oh well
73	pos	I'm happy as every with my new G502 and should be for another 2-3 years I imagine
73	pos	**EDIT** 12/25/19Have to send this back for a replacement
73	pos	The mouse wheel buttons are defective
73	pos	If you press down on the middle mouse button it presses the left and right side wheel buttons as well (randomly)
73	pos	The left and right wheel buttons are ridiculously sensitive to the slightest touch
73	pos	They even get pressed when I'm just using the wheel and not meaning to press a button
73	pos	Really hoping this is a defect in this particular mouse and not a widespread problem with the new HERO line of the G502
73	pos	My old G502 has no issue with this whatsoever even after years of hard use
73	pos	**EDIT** 12/27/19First off, big ups to AMAZON for sending me a replacement so quickly
73	pos	Great customer service
73	pos	Bad news is it seems the issue I am having wasn't a one off problem
73	pos	You literally can't click the middle mouse button without clicking a left or right side wheel click simultaneously
73	pos	I hope I am explaining this right
73	pos	I guess it would be buttons 10 and 11 that depress when you push the mouse wheel left or right
73	pos	I bind all 11 mouse buttons for games and nearly every time I click the middle mouse, it clicks button 10 or 11 as well
73	pos	I've decided to keep the mouse because its still a great everyday driver but for a gaming mouse, I wouldn't recommended it if you like to use the middle mouse click
74	pos	So during the TOTALLY necessary lockdowns where no one was allowed to do anything being a teenage nerd I got ridiculously addicted to gaming again
74	pos	Top 1% of Warzone, nightly 5+ squad get togethers, solo stomping, all of it
74	pos	Point is, in my many years of PC gaming (starting all the way back at Wolfenstein 3D) I have never been as impressed with a mouse as this one
74	pos	Let me start by saying how rock solid it is
74	pos	I’m one of those rage gamers
74	pos	It was worse when I was drunk
74	pos	I’ve broken many a mouse, it became so common my gf became concerned (not with me acting out against her but with how much money I was spending on mice 😂)
74	pos	So that said…I’ve purchased this mouse twice, and I gotta say…
74	pos	I his mouse has taken physical abuse better than any gaming peripheral I’ve ever seen
74	pos	It even worked when mostly broken
74	pos	When it’s not broken it works fantastic as well
74	pos	Accurate, super customizable, wonderfully ergonomic if you have giant weight lifting meat claws like me
74	pos	They come in wireless and light versions too (it is a bit on the heavy side if you have string bean arms)
74	pos	Anyway, it only makes sense the 502 replace the MX518 as my favorite mouse
75	neg	Logitech has been a company I've used all my life
75	neg	They used to be top of their game
75	neg	I bought this mouse as a replacement for my old, worn out, logitech gaming mouse which had developed an issue of double clicking on a single click, or not clicking at all
75	neg	This new mouse (logitech hero), developed the same issue in less then a couple months
75	neg	I gave it a try over the next several months trying everything to fix it
75	neg	I haven't reached out to logitech yet (will be doing so asap), but I do see the logitech forums plastered with people having these same problems, with no response from Logitech
75	neg	I would highly suggest that you check out all the options from other manufactures prior to buying a new mouse
76	pos	Too much
76	pos	Like trying to drive a Ferrari GT to the grocery store
76	pos	Maybe professional gamers like or need 11 mouse functions but I found some to be in the way and have had to disable half of them
76	pos	The software is not intuitive, and seems to have a mind of its own
76	pos	Even though the new firmware recognized I had Destiny 2 and Division 2, the profiles seemed to only work part time
76	pos	I ended up having to set the default to a keybind layout that would work on both
76	pos	The Extremely high DPI gets in the way
76	pos	In the middle of a fight my mouse is suddenly all over the place and I find the DPI has shifted up to 10,000 or 12,000
76	pos	My DPI default is set to 2400 and the DPI shift button toggles it down to 1000
76	pos	Logitech makes great stuff, I have many other items
76	pos	This mouse is built well, solid and feels good
76	pos	Just way too much overkill
76	pos	Do you really need 5 different weights to be placed in the base
76	pos	tried 3 different weight configurations
76	pos	basically unnoticeableI have a basic 5 button mouse from a different manufacturer that cost 1/3 of this but is just as solid in feel but much more confident in reliability of control while gaming
77	neg	I am writing this review after about 6 months of using this mouse
77	neg	I bought this mouse as a replacement for my M720 Triathlon, which I had used for about a year and a half before then
77	neg	The issue I had with the Triathlon was that it began to double click items when I only clicked them once, and I could no longer drag and drop objects across my desktop without the mouse "dropping" them along the way, despite the fact that I was still holding the button
77	neg	When this mouse began showing the same symptoms, I was disheartened to say the least, especially so since the mouse was out of the return window, but less than a year old
77	neg	I looked into the issue deeper and found that the culprit was the Omron switches used inside the mouse, for the left and right click
77	neg	A number of people had suggested switching them for Kailh GM 4
77	neg	0 switches, so I decided to fix this mouse instead of buying a new one
77	neg	I bought four of the Kailh switches, and I and a friend replaced the old Omrons in both my G502 Hero and my M720 Triathlon, and now they both work flawlessly
77	neg	The cause of the double-click bug is due to a technical oversight in the switches longevity when in a newer, more power-conservative circuit, I was told
77	neg	I found it strange, however, upon opening the mouse to replace the switches, that the DPI Up & Down buttons, as well as the side DPI Button on the G502 Hero all use Kailh switches, while the left and right still use the Omrons
77	neg	This is likely due to the Omron switches having been considered the higher quality option, at the time of this mouses inception, but by that point, I am certain Logitech was already aware of the issues that switch was facing
77	neg	If you can replace the switches, either by yourself or with some help, I can recommend this mouse, otherwise, expect to replace it within two years, most likely
77	neg	UPDATE: 9 Months InAfter a few months since my review, it is now April, and the Hyperscroll feature of the device stopped working abruptly
77	neg	I hadn't done anything to merit this, it simply quit
77	neg	After dismantling the mouse (again), I found that the interior mechanism which allows switching between Hyperscrolling and traditional scrolling (which lets the scroll wheel spin freely) is a simple spring and a pin, with a plastic paddle, and a small gear system that allows the switch from one mode to another
77	neg	When the paddle is engaged, it pushes the pin away from the scroll wheel, which allows the wheel to spin without clicking
77	neg	When disengaged, the pin is pushed against the scroll wheel, which causes the familiar click/bump of scrolling
77	neg	Pretty simple, except that whoever designed this mechanism didn't account for a few important aspects: The spring they used is about 4x too weighty for the job, and the pin is held in by
77	neg	hope
77	neg	I guess
77	neg	there really isn't anything stopping the pin from moving side to side, and it can move too far from the paddle, meaning that when the paddle goes to make contact enough to push the pin away, it goes right by, and the scroll clicks regardless, as there's nothing to push it away from the wheel
77	neg	Since the spring has way too much tension for its purpose, it does do an excellent job at one thing: pushing the pin right out of place
77	neg	Two millimeters of plastic, on the edge of the paddle, to hold the pin in, would have stopped this, or making the pin go the whole way through, and adding a second mount on the other side of the wheel, to hold it in place
77	neg	I can think of at least ten different ways to prevent this pin from sliding
77	neg	Unlike the Omron switches, which I can forgive as a possible oversight, as the choice to use them was likely misinformed with out dated information, the issues plaguing the scroll wheel should have been addressed before the mouse even reached production, as this is an easily noticed and easily amended flaw
77	neg	All of these issues have driven my rating of this device from 5 stars, to 4 stars, and now 2 stars
77	neg	I give the device 2 stars because, at the end of the day, it is user serviceable, and I like Logitech
77	neg	I've had good experiences with their products every single time I've bought them until now, and its very unfortunate that this is the first thing I've bought from them that has disappointed me
77	neg	I cannot recommend this mouse
78	pos	After 12 years, my MADCATZ mouse finally gave up the ghost, and I needed a replacement gaming mouse
78	pos	As my budget now is much more limited, and MADCATZ isn't what it used to be, I chose to go with this one based on reviews I had read online
78	pos	It has performed quite well, and with my large hands, the fit is pretty good
78	pos	The only issue I have had, as have others, is the middle wheel/button
78	pos	It is very easy to mis-click with it, and hit one of the side buttons when trying to click the center
78	pos	I highly recommend not using the center or wheel side buttons for anything essential in the game, as in the heat of a big battle, the odds of you hitting the wrong ability are pretty high
78	pos	I keep the utility abilities on the middle button
78	pos	The scroll function is good, and it's nice to be able to turn off the wheel clicker for free scrolling when I want
78	pos	However the side buttons on the wheel don't have a definite on/off click to them, and there is a sort of light clickyness as you move it side to side, almost like a two stage switch with a single function, and the angle of your finger can cause it to very easily trigger it, especially if you have used it recently for one of the side functions, and it's in the first stage
78	pos	I have found that to ensure the right button is hit, that I have to stretch my finger flat over the wheel to ensure that I get a true straight down motion
78	pos	Given this, as well as the placement of the other buttons, I wouldn't recommend this mouse to anyone with small hands, especially as there is no adjustment capability
78	pos	With adjustment capability and a better middle button/scroll, this would be a 6 star mouse
78	pos	As for the rest, it integrates perfectly into my Logitech software for my G13 as well as any other Logitech hardware I may pick up in the future, and they work well together
78	pos	I have had no tracking issues, and as I use a rather large HD TV as a monitor, it was simple to adjust tracking for a comfortable fit to my large screen while still keeping fine control over game movement
78	pos	I don't regret buying and using this mouse
78	pos	I haven't had it very long, so I can't speak to longevity, but at this price point, I would be very surprised to get 12 years of heavy use out of it, though I do expect it to last a while, as I have had vey good experiences with Logitech hardware over the years
79	neg	I bought this mouse to replace another mouse that had lasted 5 years
79	neg	This mouse was purchased because I wanted a quality product that would last
79	neg	Turns out it did not last even 4 months before the left click started to double click and lose the sensor that is is being held down
79	neg	I click and drag a lot for work, and this is unacceptable that the mouse did not even make it a year
79	neg	Very disappointed in Logitech product quality for this price range
80	pos	There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately
80	pos	1) Daily useNot everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day
80	pos	The rest goes to programming, studying, etc
80	pos	So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs
80	pos	Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition
80	pos	Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option
80	pos	Well, for daily use I can list the following pros: - Fits incredibly well around your hand - Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use  > Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc
80	pos	- Great grip - Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software2) GamingWhen I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode
80	pos	I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully
80	pos	Following pros: - You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's
80	pos	The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse
80	pos	When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better
80	pos	- The buttons are programmable
80	pos	This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want
80	pos	Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer
80	pos	I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back
80	pos	Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something) - The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse
80	pos	Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not
80	pos	With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer
80	pos	Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure
80	pos	(Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win
80	pos	The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage
80	pos	Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it
80	pos	Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference
80	pos	Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two
80	pos	Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing
80	pos	If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure
80	pos	Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage
80	pos	I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much
80	pos	Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important
80	pos	So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show
80	pos	Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in
81	pos	This mouse is awesome for gaming and office work
81	pos	It is on the heavier side even without any weights inside the mouse
81	pos	I have bigger hands and my hand fits comfortably
81	pos	I do a ton of gaming with a side of office work with daily use and this mouse holds up for whatever task is thrown at it
81	pos	The software to control everything is great, but not perfect
81	pos	I like the accessibility you have with the software along with the hardware too
81	pos	The RGB is a nice touch
81	pos	I like that when you change your DPI you can quickly glance at the RGB lights to determine which one you're using
81	pos	I have 2 complaints and that is that the 2 buttons to the side of the left-click button are easy to click on accident
81	pos	It doesn't happen to me a lot, but it definitely does happen usually when I go to place my hand back on the mouse
81	pos	My second complaint is that the rubber grips get dirty and it is kind of hard to clean in my opinion because of the texture it has
81	pos	Great mouse overall
82	neg	Love this except for one flaw that is kinda bothering me
82	neg	I’ve rearranged the weights several times to try to fix, to no avail
82	neg	While gaming, I’ll be moving around, then will remove my hand COMPLETELY from the mouse
82	neg	But my screen will still zoom in or move around as if I was still moving it
82	neg	And I’ve made the sure wheel is not moving, nothing is moving
82	neg	But it continues to do this day after day on at least two of my games
82	neg	Also just realized (when I was on Logitech's site looking at possible ways to fix this) that the mouse is supposed to light up on the side piece as well, not just the Logitech symbol
82	neg	Mine is not
82	neg	So this makes me wonder now if I DO in fact have a defective product
82	neg	I'll give it a go for a couple more days, but if the scrolling issue doesn't get resolved, I'll be sending it back
82	neg	I did just turn on the switch to stop the wheel from free spinning, just in case that was the issue, though I'm sure it was not, as I made sure it was not spinning when the zooming/unzooming has happened
82	neg	Otherwise this mouse is awesome
82	neg	That’s the only reason for the 3 stars
82	neg	The mouse fits comfortably to my hand, feels great, and has great response times
82	neg	**Update** I have sent this back
82	neg	The lights on the side randomly come on
82	neg	The zooming got a little better once I locked the wheel, but part of the reason for having it was the free spinning
82	neg	I’m going to get another one and cross my fingers**2nd Update** instead of getting another wired version, I went ahead and got the wireless
82	neg	Same design and after using it for a week, I’m completely in love
83	neg	Overall, this would be a 4 or 5 star product out of the box, but it seems like, over time, nearly 100% of these mice eventually develop a faulty sensor for either the left or right mouse button
83	neg	In simple terms, when holding down the mouse button (right, in my case) the button will electrically release and reclick, despite being physically held down with constant pressure
83	neg	For some games, this may not even noticeable, but for others it can render the game unplayable
83	neg	For example, you might be aiming down the scope of a rifle, when suddenly the mouse releases your aim, then looks back down the scope, and repeats this several times over a few seconds, making aiming effectively impossible
83	neg	From what I've read online (could be completely wrong, I'm not an expert) the switches logitech uses are relatively cheap Chinese-made switches not ideal for operating at the low voltages this mouse outputs
83	neg	What happens is the switches develop a static charge that resists voltage potential and can interrupt current flowing through the sensor
83	neg	A quick fix is to lightly blow under the faulty mouse button - the moisture in your breath helps dissipate excess charge built up on the switch, and this will temporarily fix the button
83	neg	Unfortunately it's a short lived fix and has diminishing returns over time - at first the problem wouldn't return for months, now I have to do this once per day
83	neg	Really annoying and unfortunately the problem developed just a few days outside the 1 year warranty window, so I replaced it with a Razer Viper Ultimate and I'm much happier with it than the G502
84	pos	I bought the original (non-Hero) G502 about 5 years ago and loved it
84	pos	I bought this mouse as a backup and just opened it up about a month ago when the scroll wheel of my original got a piece of dust stuck in it and would center click as I scrolled
84	pos	I've since got the piece out and it works fine again though
84	pos	I have larger hands and this mouse is a little longer than others I've tried so it fits me really well
84	pos	I love the freewheel scroll feature
84	pos	I don't think I will be able to go back to a mouse without that after using this thing
84	pos	This mouse has just about everything I could ask for
84	pos	Different profiles, on the fly sensitivity changes, plenty of buttons, customizable RGB
84	pos	Its a fairly heavy mouse even without the weights
84	pos	I have left the weights out completely of both of my mice
84	pos	I would say it is fairly durable
84	pos	I have 2 younger children and my original G502 has held up to years of their abuse and I'm sure the new one will as well
84	pos	At $37, I will probably be buying a 3rd one just to keep as a backup
85	neg	If I had to buy it over again based on the mouse alone I wouldn't
85	neg	Ergonomically, it feels bulky and a bit awkward
85	neg	Since that's a bit subjective, I'd say it might be worth a look at if your hands are on the larger side, however the software from day 1 has been buggy, and not worked properly
85	neg	Ive tinkered with it for a few weeks now and still cant get it to to start with the computer
85	neg	It still periodically freezes and requires a re-install to get it working again
85	neg	Google "LG hub error" and make your decision based off those results
85	neg	If the software's going to be integral it should be light, precise and stable
85	neg	It is none of those things
85	neg	3/19/21 update: Now Logitech Ghub sporadically switches profiles
85	neg	More errors
85	neg	Google results show many with the same issue
85	neg	Running this on a 2020 RTX laptop, so hardware compatibility should not be an issue
85	neg	Downgraded to 1 star because I am no longer using the mouse due to software issues
85	neg	7/13/21 update: More Ghub issues- freezes and there is an article on how to fix the problem online (so it's a known issue) but it is a tedious process to re-install the proper way (doing a simple add/remove wont work and the error persists) At this point, assuming GHUB is part of all logitech mice, I would avoid Logitech mice all together
86	pos	I got this because I thought it had some heft to it, but even with all the weights added to it it's still a bit light, but it is better than the ultra light 3 button mouse I was using
86	pos	I have large hands and it is just a touch small for me
86	pos	The scroll wheel seems to be a bit too sensitive, although that might be due to some software glitch that the last Windows update caused
86	pos	You can't turn the RGB off but you can set it to one colour and not have it flashing
86	pos	Also the DPI buttons are on the side where my thumb rests, I have no reason to change them on the fly, and would rather have the usual extra 2 buttons there instead of on the top left of the mouse
87	pos	I bought this mouse to replace a very disappointing Corsair mouse of similar design that finally wore out
87	pos	I can say that this mouse stands up next to the Corsair counterparts reasonably well albeit with a bit less "flair"
87	pos	I found the feel and movement to be comparable and the DPI setting ranges are equal if not a bit better in this case
87	pos	There are plenty of buttons and the customizable weight was a feature that I first thought was largely useless, but actually gave me a chance to improve the feel and movement from the "stock" configuration
87	pos	The one drawback I've found is the scroll wheel
87	pos	You have two options: rock hard or complete freewheel
87	pos	After using it for a few weeks I determined that the "rock hard" setting became tiresome when scrolling through webpages and that the freewheel setting enabled quick scrolling
87	pos	However, when in freewheel, the wheel has a terrible tendency to have backlash, most likely due to the sensor design
87	pos	I haven't encountered any broken switches or movements, but suspect several of the reports of "broken wheels" may be due either to the user not realizing the mode is toggled by the (undocumented) toggle "button" just below the wheel or using the "button" as a brake in freewheel mode, which I found will likely cause the ratcheting mechanism to bind and break
87	pos	Another somewhat disappointing feature of the wheel is that the left and right scroll wheel movements are single clicks rather than repeating, which requires repeated clicking left or right to scroll instead of having a continuous movement like older Logitech mice did
87	pos	I found the left-right scroll doesn't work with all programs either (Excel being one), which was also a disappointment
87	pos	Another recent discovery is that, like the Corsair I had previously, recent updates to their software can cause severe system crashes, which has led me to disable updating altogether
87	pos	Attempts to alert the company to this issue met with a canned response, leading me to believe they're not too concerned about the quality of their driver software, which is unfortunate
87	pos	This would be a five-star mouse if the scroll wheel was improved and if we didn't have to worry about a driver software update completely breaking our systems without warning
88	neg	The media could not be loaded
88	neg	For the first year this mouse was truly fantastic, would have whole-heartedly given it 5 stars, however after only a single year I have encountered a problem that renders the mouse nigh unusable
88	neg	After only a single year, the primary button, m1, suffers from severe stuttering and unreliable response from user inputs
88	neg	It is utterly ridiculous for a mouse at this price point to suffer from a hardware flaw like this so soon, and apparently it is a common issue with many other logitech brand mice
88	neg	Trying to navigate through the Logitech warranty website is a purposefully roundabout experience in order to do anything except give you a replacement under their own warranty policy
88	neg	This is  made increasingly more aggravating by attempting to fight your way through their site with a busted mouse
88	neg	Needless to say I am very disappointed in my purchase and will be avoiding Logitech for any future hardware needs
89	neg	This mouse is a major disappointment----1--The biggest problem is a defective left-click button ---- The button operates randomly and can take anywhere from 1 to 4 clicks to open a program
89	neg	When I went online to see if the defect was solvable, there were 100s of “Logitech Mouse Button Click Problems” hits
89	neg	Given the button defect, the mouse is being returned
89	neg	2--The new Logitech 9
89	neg	02 gaming software is a pain in the neck and worked so poorly that I uninstalled it and reverted to a prior version of the software that is far more user-friendly
89	neg	3--The mouse wheel has a slippery graphite feel, which is somewhat surprising for a mouse built for exact mouse movement
89	neg	4--The “user documentation” that came with the mouse was limited to a few small stick figures with text so small that I had to pull out a magnifying glass to read it
89	neg	The mouse did come with a large G decal and a fancy, but useless, color promo flyer----  I suspect that most users would prefer that you dump the flyer and decal and devote more focus to a decent instruction sheet
90	neg	Just holding this mouse makes my wrist cramp, it forces a claw-grip with your pinky and ring finger to hold the mouse and is extremely uncomfortable when you have to grip it hard
90	neg	The Software (G Hub) is required, and has to be RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND at all times in order for 90% of the mouse's features to work
90	neg	The mouse claims to have on-board memory but NONE of the settings can be customized with it, you can only use pre-made profiles which all suck
90	neg	So if you want to change DPI, Polling Rate, or any of the button functions, you need G Hub running at all times
90	neg	For folks like me who like to squeeze as much performance from their machines as possible, this is unacceptable
90	neg	In my task manager right now there are 6 different G Hub
90	neg	exes using up a total of 246 CPU threads, and an absurd 300mb of RAM
90	neg	If the mouse had working on-board memory this wouldn't even be worth mentioning, but it doesn't, so it is
90	neg	Coming from a G700 (another Logitech mouse) I thought this mouse would be an upgrade, little did I know that my 7 year old mouse was leaps and bounds ahead of this modern brick
90	neg	My G700 also needed Logitech software to customize, but it had WORKING ON-BOARD MEMORY, meaning if I wanted to set the DPI and save it to the mouse for use on another PC I could easily do so, with the new G Hub software this is impossible
91	pos	07/19/2021I've bought this product twice, once back in November of 2019, a second time a week ago
91	pos	The issue was that the left click was no longer working as intended
91	pos	I was not able to click and drag anything and would occasionally register a double click
91	pos	Apparently this is a common issue, but at the price, I just couldn't find another mouse that could compete
91	pos	At the price, it's reasonable, I just wish if it was such a common issue, for it to have been fixed already especially since it's one of their more popular gaming mouse
91	pos	Since then, I've also purchased a MX Master 3 and use them side by side depending on my uses
91	pos	It's still one of the better gaming mouse out there, especially for the price
92	pos	To fully take advantage of this mouse's precision, go to the mouse settings on Windows, set it to the slowest setting, then go into the Logitech software and up the DPI
92	pos	This will give you the most precise tracking you can get from the mouse
92	pos	A lost of people seem to just use a lower DPI in the mouse software and wonder why with small movements, the mouse becomes jumpy
92	pos	Don't be that person
92	pos	Set up your software correctly
92	pos	And why do you want to do it this way
92	pos	Well, because the mouse has buttons with which you can slow it down or speed it back up anytime - it works in normal windows mode and in games on a hardware level and there is no adjustment needed after you set it up initially
92	pos	The other way round, you would have to go into game and/or Windows settings to make those changes
92	pos	PS: I also have the G900 and G903 with PowerPlay
92	pos	I use the G502 HERO for my work machine I mainly use for office work and I used a cheaper mouse before that was just so annoying when trying to pull on Excel cell corners - you need the precision at that place
92	pos	However, I didn't want to break the bank after spending over $200 for a wireless low latency setup on my gaming PC
92	pos	This mouse has all that for less than $50 with the only limitation that it is wired
92	pos	I love heavier mice and this one has weights
92	pos	Surely a Plus as well for me
93	neg	if you want a great gaming mouse that remembers your settings, this is NOT what you're looking for
93	neg	look
93	neg	all the other positive reviews about the features, buttons, button sets, etc
93	neg	are true
93	neg	this has the potential to be SUCH a great mouse
93	neg	but *EVERY* time it does an update to its software (which is at least once a week) it WIPES OUT all your settings
93	neg	so you have to go back through and ONE BY ONE put each setting back on each button
93	neg	sometimes 3 times a week
93	neg	logitech has confirmed this is the EXPECTED behavior
93	neg	the "work around"
93	neg	they expect YOu to export your settings to the cloud, and then reimport EVERY time it updates
93	neg	so i turned off auto updates
93	neg	guess what
93	neg	IT AUTO UPDATES ANYWAY
93	neg	it COMPLETELY ignores your settings to not update
93	neg	this behavior exists on both mac and pc
93	neg	THIS
93	neg	THING
93	neg	IS
93	neg	GARBAGE
94	pos	I’ve read a lot of reviews where people complain about a double clicking issue or uncomfortable button locations and stuff so I thought I’d share my thoughts
94	pos	I got it a week ago and so far I’ve experienced zero issues with it whatsoever but the double clicking problem usually doesn’t develop until later so if it does come up eventually, I will update my review
94	pos	The sensor is this mouse is legit, one of the best I’ve ever come across and I’ve used a lot of gaming mice in my life
94	pos	From Razer to Alienware, this one competes with the best of them
94	pos	The adjustable weights are also a plus
94	pos	I’m not hardcore on FPS so I don’t use them but they can come in handy for those of you who are into shooters
94	pos	The extra buttons are also a big plus
94	pos	It has a couple and they can be very useful
94	pos	The only downside I can think of is the mouse itself is rather a bit small for my taste and I think it could use a pinky support but I do have large hands so perhaps it isn’t applicable for everyone
94	pos	Also while it does have many extra buttons, the thumb one is awkwardly positioned right under the thumb so I frequently press it by mistake
94	pos	The two index finger buttons next to left click are also a bit inconvenient because one would have to move the index finger off the important left click to use them
94	pos	Conclusion: I got it on sale for $39
94	pos	99 and for the price it’s a fantastic deal
94	pos	At its full price of $80 however they may be better options but either way, it is a solid product
95	pos	I've always loved the Magic Mouse and can't give that up because of the multitouch features, but this mouse is so comfortable, and moves so effortlessly, I actually look forward to using it for gaming
95	pos	Once I got it configured for a particular game, it's actually improved my playing because of the multi-button functionality
95	pos	Moving functions to the mouse instead of trying to handle multiple actions at once on the keyboard has been a huge benefit, and has actually made the game more enjoyable to play
95	pos	Nothing can replace the multi-gesture functionality of Apple's Magic Mouse surface, but this is fully in use now and I really enjoy it
95	pos	It feels very solid and slides effortlessly
95	pos	I have a small hand that has no trouble reaching all the buttons and features, and its response rate is fantastic
96	pos	So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5
96	pos	It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right
96	pos	Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great
96	pos	Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse
96	pos	The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached
96	pos	I saw another review with a similar complaint
96	pos	The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse
96	pos	It's apparently an issue
96	pos	Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb
96	pos	The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far
96	pos	I have pretty large hands
96	pos	XXL for gloves
96	pos	That button is way to far forward
96	pos	Finally, compared to the G5
96	pos	This thing feels really cheap
96	pos	The buttons are super flimsy
96	pos	The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance
96	pos	I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it
96	pos	I don't know
96	pos	I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid
96	pos	Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap
96	pos	Had I paid full price, I would be returning it
96	pos	Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more
96	pos	No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though
96	pos	Update:Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues
96	pos	First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse
96	pos	Which is fine
96	pos	The old Logitech software sucked
96	pos	Hard
96	pos	Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better
96	pos	First, it wants to do a firmware update
96	pos	So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware
96	pos	If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in
96	pos	That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software
96	pos	Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so
96	pos	You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays
96	pos	When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing
96	pos	Yet, it won't be doing it
96	pos	For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default
96	pos	So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there
96	pos	dark
96	pos	The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time
96	pos	But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights
96	pos	Instead you have to click on the main "Settings" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time
96	pos	I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this
96	pos	Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box
96	pos	Dumb dumb dumb
96	pos	I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb
96	pos	That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI
96	pos	That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much
96	pos	With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way
96	pos	As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly
96	pos	They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing
96	pos	I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice
96	pos	Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed
96	pos	Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use
96	pos	The center wheel
96	pos	Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy
96	pos	Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out
96	pos	Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture
96	pos	Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world
96	pos	Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel
96	pos	There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth
96	pos	Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars
96	pos	I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though
96	pos	It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box
96	pos	And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well
96	pos	I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well
96	pos	Still braided, but way more flexible
96	pos	Hopefully it holds up as well
97	pos	So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it
97	pos	First is the design:The design, while unusual, works fairly well
97	pos	I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons
97	pos	Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it
97	pos	It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do
97	pos	The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed
97	pos	It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons
97	pos	Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button)
97	pos	As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable
97	pos	If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB
97	pos	The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games
97	pos	In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play
97	pos	Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it
97	pos	Second is the software:The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same
97	pos	Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you
97	pos	It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind
97	pos	One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button)
97	pos	All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it
97	pos	G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded
97	pos	(G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside
97	pos	Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates
97	pos	Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well
97	pos	Third is the delivery:It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area
97	pos	I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive
97	pos	Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing
97	pos	As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time
97	pos	If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far
97	pos	But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly
98	pos	This is a fantastic mouse
98	pos	The buttons and even the scroll wheel are PERFECTLY clicky
98	pos	If you don't like that, the scroll wheel "click" can be turned off with the button directly under it, so it free spins
98	pos	You can also download it's user interface where you can download other users set-ups for specific games, etc
98	pos	and can built your own, along with setting up the "G" logo color palette
98	pos	The color vibrance and transition is so smooth and bright looking, I actually left it rainbow (my pics did not at all do the colors justice)
98	pos	The sides are rubberized, which provides excellent control for button use
98	pos	The 2 thumb buttons, 1 in front of the thumb rest & 1 above, and the 2 on the left button are extremely well placed, easy to use, but do not get accidently pushed easily
98	pos	The bottom is slighlt gridded for friction & the wire is covered in woven nylon & runs about 6 ft
98	pos	Oh, and it comes with a 5 pack of weights in their own case
98	pos	I couldn't be happier with this mouse
99	pos	I upgraded from Razer Basilisk (wired) and I would say, it is an upgrade
99	pos	Way better/more customization option, buttons clicks really good and overall build quality is awesome despite the cost of this mouse just being 40$
99	pos	Little plastic container contains multiple weights to weigh down your mouse is a surprise for me
99	pos	Those thing fits under discretely
99	pos	Now, there's one issue that has been really bothering me is the placement of G7 and G8 buttons mainly meant for upping and lowering DPI sensitivity into however many DPI stages you've added in G-Hub
99	pos	Placement sucks
99	pos	Left click is narrow and I can easily hit G7 and lowers my DPI sensitivity making me die, a lot while playing FPS such as Halo Infinite or while browsing through the internet I accidentally lower my DPI when I just want to casually browse
99	pos	If it was placed differently or had stiffer click to prevent accidents, then I wouldn't have any issues
99	pos	"But you can turn them off
99	pos	" Everyone has a different playing style and customization, I personally need them to adjust for whatever games I play so I keep accidentally lowering my sensitivity mid-game, it just ruins the moment
99	pos	Other than that issue, overall mouse is really good
99	pos	Like, actually good
100	neg	The weights are good but standard
100	neg	The resolution as expected
100	neg	Button presses require very little force (I would bet the switches would be the first things to fail)
100	neg	Update few months later: docked two stars, left button has developed switch bounce and now sometimes clicks multiple times with one press of the button
100	neg	Update months laterer: Oh man, you're gonna love this
100	neg	Button got worse (couldn't even drag anything; real fun playing the "which folder did the file get dropped into
100	neg	" game) then the right button started to display similar issues
100	neg	Logitech did send me a new one, buuuuuut
100	neg	It took me a month or two to actually get the warranty process started and it's a huge hassle
100	neg	Even once the warranty process starts and someone actually contacts you, it's only to give you a many-steps email to get you to do the troubleshooting for them (including removing their own software which makes sense as it's basically malware; it's bad)
100	neg	They make you, no joke, record a video of you clicking on a website they send you to with:- the mouse visible,- the website url visible,- the "double click counter" visible, AND- a HANDWRITTEN NOTE with the ticket number written on it
100	neg	If you can jump through all those flaming hoops and prove that, indeed, the issue you said it had (months ago) was really real they're going to have you then take a picture with:- the mouse visible,- the S/N visible (and it has to be the one on the product, not the box), AND-
100	neg	ANOTHER handwritten note with the S/N and the ticket number written on it
100	neg	I'll be honest, I expected them to next request I take a picture of myself holding the mouse with the ticket number scratched into my forehead while holding a newspaper like some sort of kidnapping victim
100	neg	They didn't ask for that, however; instead, they asked for all of my details and sent me a new one
100	neg	So, in summary:- they replaced defective product and I love being able to drag files or select text again, that's one (1) shiny gold star for Logitech added
100	neg	- they made the process so painful I'd rather have a cage-match with a gang of feral cats all hopped up on catnip and PCP than go through it again, TWO STAR: MINUS  >:-[If yours develops any issue at all during Amazon return/replace period, do it before that time runs out
100	neg	Interestingly, they don't even seem to want the mouse with the bad switch back, which would be an easy/cheap fix
100	neg	I thought they made me go through all that 'cause they're so expensive to make or something, heck they already spent a lot of money on labor hours, but
100	neg	nope
100	neg	That's right, the expensive (well
100	neg	more than $10) mouse they want you to perform 3 miracles to replace isn't worth shipping that tiny box over
101	pos	Generally, you hear a lot of good things about Logitech mice, but this one might possibly be the best one from them
101	pos	Between being able to customize the other buttons on your mouse, on top of your DPI, but it also has an unlockable mouse wheel
101	pos	Scrolling through a big inventory, or a long thread online
101	pos	Unhinge that bad boy, blare some eurobeat, and rip your finger off of the wheel
101	pos	The wheel itself is comfortable, and really sturdy when you're clicking, or even scrolling
101	pos	The other buttons don't get in the way of your clicks, and the wheel lock is completely out of the way when you're using it
101	pos	The only (probably personal) issue I have so far is, my mouse does glitch out, and moves either in one direction, or spasms
101	pos	I don't have any dust, nor debris on my mouth, so I'm unsure if I have a faulty mouse, or it could be one of those model-specific issues
101	pos	Regardless of that, this is a really nice mouse for its price
101	pos	The firmware is great (not needed), the mouse is comfortable, and if you're a fan of weighted mice like I am, it has a sizeable, adjustable weight you can fit inside
102	neg	Have gone through two of these mice already and same issue both times
102	neg	After about a year the mouse will cause the camera to look straight up and the M2 (right click) button completely gives out
102	neg	Good luck playing any FPS game without rage quitting when this inevitably occurs
102	neg	Its disappointing because brand new, the G520 Hero is a great gaming mouse
102	neg	It fits nicely in the hand, has adjustable weights, and the perfect number of buttons for most gaming styles
102	neg	Would love to purchase another but can not justify throwing more money at Logitech for a product I know will fail within a year
103	pos	The G502 is replacing two faulty Corsairs - the M65 Pro RGB and the Harpoon RGB
103	pos	Both are having typical left click failures, so I wanted something heavy with a larger footprint like the M65
103	pos	Logitech got a lot right with this design, which is why I'm not surprised it hasn't changed much over the years
103	pos	The ability to add weights is a huge plus for me since I love a large, heavy mouse for some weird reason
103	pos	The magnetic flap is one of my favorite design choices as well - it's dead simple and honestly really cool
103	pos	The scroll wheel is solid and tactile, and provides a rewarding click when using
103	pos	With the scroll button disengaged, the scroll wheel is buttery smoooooth
103	pos	I definitely dig it, especially because this mouse pulls double-duty between my gaming PC and my work laptop
103	pos	Honestly, the only issue I've found is that DPI switches positioned essentially on the left click (G7 and G8) can prove to be an annoyance if you miss the click and unintentionally increase/decrease the DPI
103	pos	I think this issue is mainly on me, though
103	pos	I change up my grips periodically, so it's really just acclimatizing to the mouse at this point
103	pos	Overall, I really dig the G502
103	pos	I've always avoided Logitech products because of their "office" products, but this mouse has definitely exceeded my expectations so far
103	pos	Since I'm still breaking it in, I'll probably update this review if it starts doing anything wonky
104	pos	I am having tracking issues with mine
104	pos	It's mainly my table to blame, but my Razor mouse don't have a problem with my desk and mouse pad
104	pos	The software does not allow me to calibrate my sensor for my mouse pad nor does it let me adjust the lift off distance like Razor software can
104	pos	My table is plastic table and the weight of my pc and monitor bow the middle of the my table causing a sunk in effect
104	pos	My table also has ripples / waves you can feel with your hand when you slide across
104	pos	The mouse pad I have hides the ripples to some degree
104	pos	So this mouse not taking a liking to this and thus not working out for me
104	pos	But when using it, you can feel it hang on something and stop moving for a sec
104	pos	My Razor mouse does not have any issue
104	pos	You can glide my Razor mouse across gravel and it still make head shots
104	pos	But this mouse not working for me
105	pos	I got this to replace a Logitech G403 Prodigy that I've had and enjoyed for 3yrs but recently developed a failing left-click switch
105	pos	I got this instead of another G403 because it was a little cheaper, apparently "the most popular gaming mouse", and has more buttons (though I don't think I'd really need all the extras)
105	pos	Two issues immediately stood out
105	pos	First, my ring finger has a place to rest on the right edge of the G403, while this mouse doesn't quite have room for it, so I'd need to modify my grip to either squeeze it on with my middle finger, or drop it over the side
105	pos	It probably wouldn't be a huge deal in the long run, but I noticed the difference in ergonomics right away
105	pos	Second, and the reason I chose to immediately return the mouse and order another G403 (a HERO this time, because that's what's available) is the scrollwheel
105	pos	The G502 scrollwheel has a slick metal surface that's almost slippery, and a LOUD clicking in step-mode
105	pos	The button for switching to smooth scrolling is a nice feature, but in step mode it's just too clunky
105	pos	By contrast, the G403 has a rubberized wheel surface that requires very little force to use and light detents that silently provide just the right amount of feedback for stepped scrolling without adding appreciable resistance
106	neg	I had an iBuyPower mouse that lasted me six years I got for $11 at a thrift store
106	neg	This g502 Logitech Hero hasn't even lasted me two years
106	neg	I was waiting to review this for this purpose
106	neg	I'm now back to using the thrift store mouse because the g502 Hero is no longer functioning
106	neg	The upside: The mouse feels nice and glides effortlessly across most surfaces
106	neg	It is comfortable
106	neg	Primary Issues: Comfort is about all this piece of junk has going for it
106	neg	Left click doesn't double click all the time, and actually stopped "clicking" a few months into use so now I just have to guess since there is no audible click or touch-sensory click
106	neg	The right click doesn't work at all most of the time and that's important for some games and functions I use on my computer, so I have to use my other mouse entirely for that purpose
106	neg	Glider Wheel broke several months in
106	neg	I was able to fix it by cleaning it out the first time, thinking it was just general build up or something, but the second time the button which allows you to utilize the smooth wheel versus the click wheel went out, and any time I try to up-scroll it doesn't register as a scroll and instead registers as me clicking the wheel
106	neg	Again, the right click stopped working
106	neg	It still clicks, I can feel it, I can hear it, but the mouse doesn't react
106	neg	I disassembled, cleaned, reassembled and still nothing
106	neg	Unreliable DPI stability feature
106	neg	Sometimes my DPI will drop well below acceptable usability, then recover on its own
106	neg	The entire software setup, this gHub or whatever, is absolute garbage
106	neg	Completely
106	neg	Ridiculous
106	neg	Trash
106	neg	It is a convoluted mess requiring so much more work than is necessary to use
106	neg	It crashes for no reason despite updates, does not save profiles, does not let you utilize macros, is not user friendly, and requires manual startup
106	neg	If you click to open it, it just sits on the "Update" screen indefinitely
106	neg	There are too many other things I want to say about this product, but overall, and being a lifelong fan of Logitech, I'm more than disappointed
106	neg	This is the second g502 Hero I've bought (the one I bought from Amazon was New/Unused) and to be quite honest I'd rather go through another company than deal with these issues anymore
106	neg	I won't be using their "gaming" mice ever again
107	pos	Someone said this is too heavy
107	pos	I don't think it is
107	pos	It's lighter than my old gaming mouse that broke
107	pos	It has too many buttons and some are near the primary ones
107	pos	You have to be careful how you hold your hand or you find yourself changing your sensitivity by accident
107	pos	Logitech's cancerous G-Hub program is required to set it up initially, but once you set the onboard memory it will work without it
107	pos	G-Hub did not work on Win 7 for me, and there's no Linux support
107	pos	You will need Windows 8+ to configure it
107	pos	I feel we're going backwards in technology and user experience here
108	pos	About a year ago I decided to get back to PC gaming
108	pos	I had started streaming and after mostly PS4 content with an underwhelming laptop to boot, I upgraded to a desktop last year which came with a good “gaming mouse”
108	pos	It was comfortable to use so I never put much thought into it
108	pos	About a month ago I decided to look around for a mouse though to see if it was even worth upgrading, talked to a few friends and they all recommended the G502
108	pos	I’ve known the Logitech brand for quite a few years and have used their cheaper wireless mice for my laptop so figured I’d give this one a shot
108	pos	And holy cow is this an awesome mouse
108	pos	The customization features in the Logitech Software alone is super easy to use and make adjustments for later
108	pos	Set different levels of sensitivity for my needs, set up the extra mouse buttons for different purposes in different games
108	pos	I’m still struggling to adjust to a mouse and keyboard after having a controller in my hands for almost three decades, this mouse has greatly assisted in my transition into the PC world
108	pos	Console gamers looking to dive into PC, give this mouse a shot, it has enough customization options to fit just about anyone’s needs
109	pos	I have/was a Razer fanboy for years
109	pos	Unfortunately razer products have started to go downhill & any support has become virtually laughable if best
109	pos	This isn't a crap on razer review but more a "thank god I found an alternative"
109	pos	When switching from my 3rd razer death adder to my first logitech G502, I immediately felt "comfortable"
109	pos	Added weights gave me the feel I wanted
109	pos	The ergonomics felt right, & the mouse overall just WORKED
109	pos	I am a huge fan if the scroll wheel now also & the fact that you can set it to both standard & infinite scroll is a nice touch
109	pos	Been several months now & I think it's time I make the complete jump for the rest of my products
109	pos	My current keyboard now randomly changes audio & phantom types keys from time to time
109	pos	Not something you want while gaming
110	pos	This is an extremely precise and reliable mouse, both with movement and scroll wheel
110	pos	The only annoying thing about it is the non-adjustable "thunk" of the scroll wheel, it's too "notchy"
110	pos	You can engage/disengage that notch, but:- if you disengage it, the scroll wheel becomes too sensitive, the slightest touch and it scrolls
110	pos	- if you engage it, the scroll wheel has a super annoying "thunk" every time you turn the mouse wheel
110	pos	becomes extremely precise, but super annoying (feel and sound)Tried the MX3 before this one -> the MX3 was better built, had a better scroll wheel feel, but was glitchy every so often (the scroll wheel was precise only ~99% of the time, couldn't find a way to get rid of that glitchiness in their "Logi Options" software, tried all possible settings/sensitivity)
110	pos	In the end, I went with the razer basilisk -> extremely precise, scroll wheel sensitivity can be adjusted with a knob under the mouse (no software needed
110	pos	- I hate having to install mouse/keyboard software, for any reason)
111	pos	This is competing with the g300s for my favorite mouse
111	pos	Buttons: It has enough buttons to assign several functions to them in games without going overboard
111	pos	I really wanted a mouse with extra buttons directly adjacent to the M1 or M2 button like the g300s had and this one has two next to the M1 button and a couple of thumb buttons
111	pos	Weight: Medium to heavy depending on weights added
111	pos	There is a hinged magnetic "door" on the bottom of the mouse that makes it extremely easy to adjust the weight of the mouse on a whim
111	pos	My g300s was ultra lightweight, which made flick shots extremely easy but glidey tracking wasn't perfectly smooth
111	pos	This one glides extremely well and flicks well with the weights taken out
111	pos	Adding too much weight can cause overshoot or a kind of rubber banding effect when I throw my hand quickly, but more weight feels like it has easier gliding and tracking
111	pos	Features: This has things like profile shifting and a temporary dpi shift "sniper" button but I never use those
111	pos	It does have a scroll wheel lock and unlock button that lets you choose between the clicky single line scrolling or the friction free high speed scrolling, which I change all the time as needed
111	pos	Usually for browsing
111	pos	Software: Let's you change your lights, button assignments, make macros, etc
111	pos	The usual
111	pos	Cons: The only minor con is that the scroll wheel very slightly jiggles when flicking the mouse quickly
111	pos	It has never caused me problems, but I can feel it when it happens
111	pos	I fixed it by using a thin nylon washer with a slit cut in it so I could lower it on the "axle" the scroll wheel is attached to
111	pos	The jiggle was nearly eliminated and the friction free scrolling still works fine
112	pos	I really wanted to love this mouse
112	pos	I am a casual gamer, and I thought this would up my game a bit with precision and programmable buttons, etc
112	pos	Sadly, after using it for an afternoon, I found to be a poor choice for me
112	pos	Pros:-The smoothness of the sensing is excellent
112	pos	I felt my ability to pick precise targets in shooting scenarios would be enhanced compared to my old Microsoft mouse
112	pos	-The ability to switch the scroll button to free-wheeling is handy and satisfying
112	pos	-Materials do seem to be nice and solid
112	pos	-The weights are a nice touch for customizability
112	pos	-The lights add visual appeal without being too flashy
112	pos	Colors are customizeable
112	pos	-The quantity of buttons available is good, and their locations are easily accessible by fingers without accidental touches just from gripping the mouse itself
112	pos	-The sliding surfaces on the bottom are smooth and large
112	pos	-The feel in my larger than average hands was nice
112	pos	Ergonomics were good compared to a more standard shape
112	pos	-The thumb button for engaging low DPI would be good if I could get used to it
112	pos	-The multiple profiles available for single or multiple customized DPI & programmed button settings is nice
112	pos	Cons:-There's too much resistance on the scroll wheel when free-wheeling is disengaged
112	pos	When my fingers were dry, they would actually slip on the metal wheel surface instead of rolling it
112	pos	-The left/right bump buttons on the scroll wheel are easy to press, but the center scroll button is hard to press
112	pos	I found it very difficult to consistently press only the center scroll button
112	pos	Most of the time I was accidentally pressing down and left or right at the same time
112	pos	-My habit of wedging my thumb against the mouse pad and mouse for extra precision is not possible with this mouse due to the ergonomic wing shape on the left side
112	pos	I found this highly annoying, and it made it harder for me to hit targets
112	pos	If I could get used to toggling the DPI on the fly, this might be ok, but for $50 I don't want to work that hard to love it
113	neg	I don't write reviews much but look another way for a gaming mouse
113	neg	The left click works when it wants too
113	neg	I play FPS shooters and much other games, but the clicks have been giving me issues
113	neg	When ADS in FPS shooters, it's like the mouse is in rapid fire or its to sensitive with clicks and acts like a double or triple click and this is really annoying in gaming or even casual use as when you try to drag and drop or click on a folder or app it will double or triple click most of the time
113	neg	I would've returned it but its been sometime
113	neg	Not sure if I would get another Logitech mouse as I've been let down twice already
113	neg	The other products they make are great but the mice in my experience are terrible
114	neg	I just wanted a simple mouse for a cheap price but I guess you get what you pay for
114	neg	I’ve had good luck with Logitech products in the past so I figured this mouse would be decent
114	neg	There’s not a lot of good, long-lasting gaming mice on the market anymore and I was worried about spending too much just to have them stop working in a couple months
114	neg	This one was great at first and appeared to work just right, and didn’t give me the dreaded double-click issue I had with previous gaming mice but after a month, the cursor started to do its own thing
114	neg	It would randomly drag itself across the screen and freeze and I’d have to unplug and re-plug-in the mouse to my computer in order for it to start up again
114	neg	Super annoying after the first two or three times and it began doing it more often as time went on
114	neg	I thought it was a computer issue but it did the same thing on other devices
114	neg	I ended up getting a different mouse recently
114	neg	This one is not worth buying
115	neg	G502 Hero Mouse from Logitech, Review
115	neg	I've been buying the "Inferior", non-"sick
115	neg	" G300s several years
115	neg	I've owned owned a total of three G300's
115	neg	Even though the G300s physically decay like cake in the rain, I strongly recommend buying a G300s instead of this G502 piece of absolute garbage
115	neg	LET ME EXPLAIN:To start, the Hand-Feel for me is really bad, and I usually end up holding it in a way that makes reaching two of the Thumb buttons very awkward
115	neg	I normally get Ambidextrous mice , so that's my fault
115	neg	And really, it's also my fault for having strange hands
115	neg	But that's not what makes the G502 the worst mouse I've touched in over a decade
115	neg	NEGATIVES:What is NOT my fault is the overly sensitive Click Pressure on all the face and side buttons
115	neg	I don't know if that's an intended feature, or I just got mouse from a lot that was over-tuned
115	neg	But it's far too easy to accidentally click when sliding the mouse across the pad
115	neg	ANY resistance from your surface and CLICK
115	neg	Glance any part of a button that isn't the exact center: CLICK
115	neg	Gently feel for where the buttons are in the dark, while being careful to use far less force than should reasonably be needed to depress a button far enough to engage the mechanism : CLICK
115	neg	CLICKCLICK
115	neg	CLICK
115	neg	MORE NEGATIVES:The Mouse Wheel has to be some cruel experiment in psychological warfare
115	neg	The Lock/Unlock implementation warrants detailed comment in both states
115	neg	Beyond the fact that it is an unwanted feature at the best of times -- when gaming, it will actively hinder your enjoyment and performance -- unless you dedicate your life mastering it, and I have no intention of doing anything remotely close to that
115	neg	* As a free spinning wheel, it fails due to floatiness
115	neg	Unless you just want to rip-scroll through several pages of product reviews on Amazon to record for a video project, it has no use case that is superior to any other scrolling function available to users, and that includes the Middle Mouse Button scrolling that the mouse still possesses (I'll get to MMB issues later)
115	neg	* As a tick wheel, it FAILS because the ratchet is far too loose to be trusted
115	neg	You get this awful effect where physically, the wheel will "back rock" or fore rock" to cradle itself between the teeth
115	neg	This then causes your scroll selection to tick up or down onto something other than your intent
115	neg	Not always, mind you
115	neg	But enough (and unpredictably so) to seriously impede, if not, ruin whatever gaming moment you might have been having
115	neg	Further exacerbating the issue is you cannot change the internal DPI of the mouse wheel sensor
115	neg	Not with your OS, not with G HUB, not with ANYTHING
115	neg	You can only change how your Operating System MULTIPLIES the Wheel Motion
115	neg	And even with a 1:1 multiple, you get that selection rocking issue
115	neg	And anything LESS than 1:1 results in no scrolling whatsoever unless you unlock and rip-scroll
115	neg	MOAR NEGATIVES:Oh and this is all before the issues of trying to get a clean Click out of the Middle Mouse Button buried under this infernal, Chroenburgian assembly
115	neg	It feels like trying to command a Two year old into behaving, using only soft verbal warnings, while sliding supine across a frozen lake, while also being used as hockey puck by competing teams of various drunken Canadian bears and moosen
115	neg	This would be an absolutely great mouse to lend to your competition
115	neg	if this was the design intent, hat's off to ya
115	neg	But, to put everything I've said even more viscerally
115	neg	I want to rip the wheel out of the mouse with my teeth and grind it until my gums bleed
115	neg	It's rare that I'm passionate at all about a design feature
115	neg	But this wheel, I HATE IT
115	neg	I want the person who designed it to feel as bad about making it, as I do trying to use it
115	neg	NEVER REVISIT THIS DESIGN EVER AGAIN
115	neg	You just don't get it
115	neg	It literally adds a layer of anxiety and distrust to EVERY SINGLE THING done with this mouse
115	neg	Even the tasks that have nothing to do with scrolling at all
115	neg	The fact that you know this boobytrap is a centimeter from your finger is all it takes
115	neg	Oh yeah
115	neg	AND IT'S LOUD
115	neg	It doesn't even have the common courtesy to make a satisfying noise
115	neg	NO
115	neg	Shifting a from 4th Gear to Reverse at Highway speed in your uncle's rustbucket Camaro is less audibly jarring
115	neg	POSITIVES:The software is actually fairly good
115	neg	With the caveat that you cannot change the Wheel DPI nor the Wheel Up/Down command assignments (wth
115	neg	)
115	neg	The Motion is spot on, but that's baseline expectation for a +$50 MouseAnd the Weight system is a fine option, even if I'm most comfortable taking all the wrights AND THE DOOR off
115	neg	CONCLUSION:The G502, in my humble opinion (at least THIS one I personally received) may as well be eWaste
115	neg	I genuinely tried "Getting Used to It"
115	neg	I gave the thing several months
115	neg	But as a result, I can no longer return it
115	neg	Seriously, Logitech
115	neg	If you would just use the G502's Software, Motion Sensor and Moulded Plastic Quality for the next iteration of the G300s series: I'd buy that day one
115	neg	Give the next G300s a SOLID wheel with a strong ratchet and Side-Pivot lateral scrolling
115	neg	You could even toss in a Thumb Toggle/Switch for DPI shifting or whatever
115	neg	All these things have mechanically solid examples in your other products
115	neg	Paint the dang thing Gold, charge $80, and call it the "G399gg Great Golden Calf Edition"
115	neg	I don't care
115	neg	Just stop with these ridiculously over-designed "srz gam3r" fad features
115	neg	YOU
115	neg	ARE
115	neg	NOT
115	neg	RAZER
115	neg	YOU
115	neg	SHOULD
115	neg	BE
115	neg	BETTER
115	neg	THAN
115	neg	RAZER
115	neg	PS
115	neg	I purchased this mouse via a recommendation from a friend
115	neg	Whom (upon finding out only too late) never uses the mouse wheel, extra buttons or G HUB
115	neg	So yeah, 5-Stars if you just want an overpriced 2-button Mouse
116	pos	Good well made mouse
116	pos	Packaging and shipping was excellent
116	pos	I had to give this mouse away though because it is just too large and uncomfortable for my hand size
116	pos	I also would prefer more buttons
116	pos	Size :I found the back of my hands hurting after using the mouse
116	pos	The "hump" or curve of the mouse seems high, making it a reach for the far left side button (default aim)
116	pos	This means I likely would not use it, bringing the amount of extra buttons down (at least for me)
116	pos	Although, my fingers did seem to automatically find the perfectly located middle back button
116	pos	I never once hit the front middle accidentally
116	pos	Perhaps because one button was too far and just the sheer size of the mouse, i did find that my fingers would sort of expect the four left buttons to be far as well, causing me reach further then they actually were and mis-press
116	pos	To be clear, those four and the middle back buttons are perfectly located so this is just me
116	pos	Buttons:The amount they state does not include the middle front button which serves as the switch for your scroll wheel (either free rolling or click
116	pos	both are great
116	pos	)
116	pos	While I like the option to choose this, I world have prefered having another mappable middle button like my current device
116	pos	Two of the mappable buttons are your scroll wheel left and right tilt
116	pos	This is cool but I felt it would have been better with more noticeable feedback like a soft click
116	pos	The wheel felt almost loose and I am curious if I would have ended up mistakenly clicking to the left or right while trying to just middle click
116	pos	I honestly think I wouldnt and it's just a matter of the user to get used to it
116	pos	Overall, a cool looking and good quality mouse with a few expertly placed buttons
116	pos	Just a bit too large and would have liked more buttons since one of them becomes semi unreachable
117	neg	**Updated review**Amazon replaced the mouse because Logitech was being difficult about honoring their warranty
117	neg	So the 2nd mouse had the same software issue as the original review but I had found a work around for the custom key assignments by using registry edits to let the mouse work with the older software
117	neg	Unfortunately this 2nd mouse has now developed the double click problem that many Logitech mice are prone to because they use cheap micro switches for the clicking mechanism
117	neg	Honestly I'm just going to switch to a different brand that uses better switches even though I've been using Logitech mice for over 20 years
117	neg	**Original review**I upgraded from an old G502 spectrum to this mouse
117	neg	FIrst of all the good things, it's of good quality construction and fits extremely well in my hand
117	neg	It slides fairly smoothly over my mouse pad and overall it's a pleasure to use
117	neg	The bad
117	neg	It is not compatible with Logitech Gaming Software and instead needs to be used with G-HUB in order to customize it's settings
117	neg	G-HUB is
117	neg	not so good
117	neg	G-HUB prevents the left/right wheel click from continuous horizontal scrolling like I could with the G502 Spectrum on LGS
117	neg	(not to be confused with the vertical scroll wheel)I can't assign custom key assignments to the mouse while using onboard-memory mode, it only works when onboard-memory is not turned on
117	neg	You can create a custom profile and then assign it to one of the 5 memory slots, but custom key assignments are for some reason not saved and/or applied
117	neg	What's the point of allowing 5 custom on-the-fly profiles to be assigned if they are not going to let you use custom key assignments
117	neg	It's one of the main features if the mouse that simply won't work because G-HUB doesn't work properly
117	neg	Logitech should enable compatibility with LGS or fix G-HUB
117	neg	Honestly I wish I could just get my money back
118	neg	Here's the bottom line for this mouse
118	neg	It's got average ergonomics, above average buttons and placement, but is spoiled by the terrible Logitech GHub software
118	neg	This mouse doesn't have any onboard memory, which means the Logitech software *has* to be running at all times for you to use anything but the basic functions
118	neg	If it closes on you (which
118	neg	it will), you immediately lose any functions you've set on those extra keys until you reopen the software
118	neg	I use this mouse on both my Mac and PC
118	neg	The interface is poorly designed, and I've yet to have it detect different games when they run on my PC
118	neg	The Mac software has even reset itself a couple times in the 3 weeks I've had it, meaning I have to go back and remap everything, reset the mouse speed, etc
118	neg	Also beware, Little Snitch shows that the G Hub software does phone home to Logitech
118	neg	You can't be sure what it's sending back and forth, especially when you're required to give it full access to your machine for it to function
118	neg	To cap it off, Logitech has *specifically* designed the extra buttons on this mouse so that they cannot be detected by any software other than G Hub
118	neg	Typically you could use an alternative like USB Overdrive or Steermouse on Mac to map buttons, but that's not an option
118	neg	To be clear, that is a deliberate design choice by Logitech to lock you in to their awful software
118	neg	I'd strongly recommend looking elsewhere for a mouse
119	pos	I got this mouse to replace my Razor Naga and my Predator(buttons quit working) for FPS
119	pos	My favorite aspect of the mouse is the adjustable weight
119	pos	i like my mouse to be heavier and i was pleasantly surprised that it came with quite a bit of weight i could add to it and make it the perfect weight
119	pos	The RGB lighting customization for the mouse is great and the software is super easy to use and that's where you can set your custom DPI and use the button on the mouse to quickly switch between the settings
119	pos	The one thing I don't like about the mouse that I've gotten used to is the size, my hand dwarfs this mouse
119	pos	Don't get me wrong its a decent size mouse but i have rather large hands so it was an adjustment but now after about 2 months of using it it feels natural and works great
119	pos	I would recommend this mouse to someone who is looking for a good FPS mouse that wont break the bank
119	pos	Fast forward 9 months the thing quit working
119	pos	Took it apart and the right click switch metal piece had broke and won't work anymore
119	pos	That little metal piece bricked the whole mouse
120	pos	I bought this mouse knowing about the double clicking problems plaguing Logitech mice
120	pos	Whether I come to regret this remains to be seen
120	pos	That said, I purchased the protection plan since everything I have heard about this mouse lead me to believe that it will fail within a few years
120	pos	Design flaws/QC defects aside, I really like this mouse so far
120	pos	It has a bunch of features not present on other mice, like the infinite scroll wheel, left and right scroll buttons on the scroll wheel, programmable profiles, and the button to temporarily change between DPI settings within a profile when held
120	pos	I'm not terribly keen on the shape of the mouse, but I'm getting used to it
120	pos	I don't like the nylon braiding on the wire
120	pos	I liked the cloth braided wires on older mice better
120	pos	Yes, they were prone to kinking over time, but that's just my personal preference in the end
120	pos	The customization software is fairly simple, but some features are easier to adjust than others
120	pos	No documentation on the software in the included instructions, but it's easy to figure out how to use it given a bit of time
120	pos	If it wasn't for the double clicking issues plaguing these mice I would say this is a solid 4
120	pos	5-5 star product, but knowing how widespread they are I'm giving this a 4 star rating instead
120	pos	This review is based on my experience so far
120	pos	If the mouse fails I will return and revise this review along with information on the RMA process
121	neg	EDIT: Beyond the minor difficulties in my original post, the software this comes with doesn't switch profiles when you're playing a game
121	neg	After spending an hour on Reddit trying every suggested fix, none of them have worked - it always reverts instantly to the default "Desktop" profile
121	neg	Really regret buying this mouse, should have stuck with Corsair
121	neg	It's a great mouse, a 5-star mouse, except for how loud the scroll wheel is
121	neg	I can't tell if I got an especially loud one, or if other people just don't notice the noise, or what, because every time I use the scroll wheel it's SO loud that I'm debating whether to keep using this mouse or not
121	neg	Hoping it'll get quieter over time because it really is a great mouse otherwise
121	neg	Just so, so, so very loud
121	neg	(You can switch between regular scroll and hyper scroll, and hyper scroll is totally silent, but it's also far too imprecise for me to use for most things
121	neg	If you're only looking for hyper scroll the noise wouldn't be an issue at all
121	neg	)
122	pos	A fine mouse it is with a lot of very nice settings and profiles that i find to work nicely
122	pos	I do think the sides are a bit slicker than i would prefer and if stickier/grippier might help with the narrowness
122	pos	As a fella with wider hands I find it to be a bit narrow with my pinky and other finger dragging the mat and I find it to be pretty low profile
122	pos	I think if you had smaller hands or likes a thinner and low profile mouse this is perfect
122	pos	If you have bigger hands and want a larger mouse I would look at the Anker precision gaming mouse, I will get another to replace my older one and give this nice mouse to my wife or daughter
122	pos	I like this mouse alot just wish they had an XL version
122	pos	BTW, the mouse wheel does not break it has a button to click rotate or free fly
123	neg	EDIT2 10/23: drifting has become way more noticeable
123	neg	This for MSRP of $80 is ridiculous
123	neg	Usually go Logitech, but it's time to try other miceEDIT: I thought I was going crazy, but my mouse has begun to drift on its own
123	neg	It's been getting worse and worse
123	neg	I don't even use this for gaming really so the durability is questionable
123	neg	I love the G602 and, besides the wireless version of the G502, the G502 wired is the closest thing to the G602
123	neg	The mouse clicks feel nice and sound quiet just like the G602
123	neg	The build quality is great and it doesn't feel cheap
123	neg	However, my biggest complaint about this mouse is that it does not have the same amount programmable buttons the G602 had
123	neg	It's a step backwards from the G602 in this regard and it would be amazing if more buttons were positioned on the left side of the mouse like the G602
124	pos	tl;dr: I have big hands, the mouse is too tapered for my palm grip and is uncomfortable
124	pos	This mouse is better for claw grips
124	pos	It's a cool mouse, but not for me
124	pos	If only the back end was thicccc enough or my palm
124	pos	I have large hands and from a diagram I was researching it was supposed to be one of the more larger sized mice
124	pos	7
124	pos	5" (~19cm) Middle to Base of Palm x 4" (~10cm) across (from the base pinky joint to index joint)
124	pos	I bought this to replace my Razer Death Adder which is far more comfortable
124	pos	I thought the Hero 502 felt narrow
124	pos	Hero 502 measures ~60mm across as the gripping area, but so does the Death Adder
124	pos	I think the problem is attributed to to the narrow tapering base where your palm sits
124	pos	On the 502 Hero, there is only about ~60mm in diameter at the base, but it's tapered so much near the top, there is almost nowhere for your palm to sit on
124	pos	(I like my palm grip when I'm aiming with my arm
124	pos	)
124	pos	In Comparison with the Death Adder at around ~73cm in diameter, my palm sits comfortably
124	pos	I've had a couple Razer products and I want to go try other things now
124	pos	The current DE Chroma, somethings are wearing off/out
124	pos	So it's time for a new mouse
124	pos	Nitpicks: The scroll wheel is more like a flywheel
124	pos	I don't want that much momentum when I flick that wheel around
124	pos	I do like the idea of tilting the wheel, cool feature
124	pos	Another nitpick is Ghub, I'm not familiar with it, but it did take a while for me to set up the DPI
124	pos	And man that was down a couple of rabbit holes
124	pos	I didn't realize GHUB had profiles for each game you had (Which can be a cool thing, but I was hoping the Desktop default was the global set for everything unless you manually change a profile for a game
124	pos	Last nitpick about GHUB, if you have a library of games, you have to keep clicking over this long horizontal list of icons
124	pos	Come on, why can't we set these to tiles of some sort
124	pos	Or just a line by line list of games
124	pos	Or a choice between all three
125	pos	PROS-Cool lights-Fits ergonomically, with adjustable weights-Lots of customizeable buttons
125	pos	For editing, I use a lot of Ctrl functions like Ctrl C, CtrlV, CtrlZ, and CtrlS, so making them each one click streamlines things a great deal
125	pos	CONS- Software is very glitchy and bloated
125	pos	Takes up a lot of memory just to assign a few buttons
125	pos	Sometimes the button assigns just reset to factory after a while
125	pos	Had to reinstall it
125	pos	-The mouse wheel is one of those free-spinning ones that you can either spin like a fidget spinner or lock into a more traditional motion
125	pos	After two months of web-browsing use, the scrolling action no longer registers accurately
125	pos	Clicking with the wheel works, but scrolling up and down has about a 20% success rate
126	neg	My proteus g502 started doing the dreaded double click after a few years so I pulled the trigger on this new "HERO" version of the g502
126	neg	I didn't know it at the time but if you buy a mouse with one of these new "HERO" sensors you will no longer be able to use the sensor/surface calibration that comes with LGS
126	neg	Logitech claims that this new "HERO" sensor does surface calibration on the fly and thus you can no longer manually calibrate it
126	neg	I've been using the mouse for about 24 hours now and its almost completely unusable even for regular web browsing, constant stuttering and deadspots
126	neg	I am using a good quality black neoprene mouse pad with a clean surface
126	neg	My g502 proteus used to do this as well but a quick surface tuning would easily resolve the problem for 6-12 months
126	neg	I found a tip online to uninstall the virtual mouse driver and reboot, this seems to have worked for a few hours but now the problems are back again
126	neg	Don't buy this "HERO" version, get the proteus version if you want a g502 (which is now twice as expensive as this mouse and more expensive than it used to be - gee i wonder why)
127	pos	I've used Logitech Mice for several years now
127	pos	I lost my old Logitech Mouse in my move to another state and I needed a replacement I bought the wireless lightspeed mouse
127	pos	It started having double clicking issues, and I ended up chucking it
127	pos	I decided to go with the standard wired mouse, and I saw the Logitech G502 Gaming mouse with the hero sensor
127	pos	It was cheap so I bought it
127	pos	All I will say is thank goodness it was cheap
127	pos	What I love about the mouse is the number of buttons you have and how it feels
127	pos	I like heavy mice and it comes with adjustable weights
127	pos	I also like how I'm able to customize the mouse to how I play my games with the software
127	pos	Note: I'm using the older Logitech software, not the newer crap they're using now
127	pos	I feel it's just more user-friendly
127	pos	I also like the "Free" mouse scrolling wheel
127	pos	Overall the mouse looks and feels good, and the price was wallet-friendly
127	pos	NOW, we get to the major issue
127	pos	Both this mouse and the light-speed wireless one I have before it ended up having double-clicking issues
127	pos	I've tried cleaning it, adjusting my mouse double-clicking speed, but to no avail
127	pos	I'm so tired of Logitech and how cheap their mice are built
127	pos	It's a crying shame too because I think the mouse is great for gaming, but that stupid double click issue is not being resolved
127	pos	This will probably be the last Logitech Gaming mouse I buy until they do a better job with making them and fixing the double-clicking issue
128	pos	Scroll: 5/10Noise (lack of): 7/10Ease of click: 6/10Speed: 10/10Price/value: 6/10Comfort: 10/10Overall, I would call this an average mouse
128	pos	It's fast, it's comfortable, and it looks nice
128	pos	Only problems
128	pos	Well, there's quite a few
128	pos	The scroll wheel has two settings: free scroll and resistance scroll
128	pos	The free wheel, while quiet, is annoying as all heck - while a great idea, it just doesn't work practically when in a game or document
128	pos	As soon as you let it fly, it literally flies - to Neverland
128	pos	I returned it for a mouse that eventually stops scrolling
128	pos	lol The mechanical resistance scroll is really loud and difficult to move
128	pos	So you basically choose between an uncontrollable infinite scroll or a "stuck" mouse wheel
128	pos	There is no in-between
128	pos	This mouse isn't advertised as "noiseless," so I'll be a little easier on it
128	pos	But it's so loud
128	pos	So damn loud
128	pos	I wanted a mouse that was quieter than my last one, but this one was louder
128	pos	While this mouse has great DPI, it's hard to click and therefore reduces your time to react
128	pos	Would not recommend for an FPS
128	pos	I tried it in Destiny 2, and the thing just was ridiculously slow
128	pos	You basically have to whack it to get it to shoot
128	pos	However, it's a very comfortable mouse
128	pos	The design is high quality and very well made
128	pos	For all its faults, though, I wouldn't pay even the sale price I got it at ($46), much less the regular price ($79)
128	pos	Average mouse, not worth the price
129	pos	This is the second time I've bought this exact mouse
129	pos	My first one lasted about five years, so there's definitely something to be said for durability
129	pos	They don't have a crap ton of buttons like the Razer Naga, but I prefer it that way (it has seven buttons, not including the right/left and wheel)
129	pos	This mouse is insanely ergonomic and feels like it was made for my hand
129	pos	The removable weights are very nice, too (I prefer all of them to be in)
129	pos	It has a very satisfying click and the wheel can either be smooth or lightly clicky
129	pos	You can also adjust your pointer speed directly on the mouse, which I adore
129	pos	The cord is long and has a fabric covering
129	pos	There's a wireless version, but those irritate me
129	pos	It also moves very smoothly on the mousepad and works great with super fast pointer speed
129	pos	Very customizable in the Logitech app, as well
130	pos	The shape and feel of the mouse is nice, and comfortable for people with larger hands
130	pos	The custom button placements are better than the older models and easier to hit
130	pos	The one issue I have is why did you make the scroller button out of Teflon
130	pos	It's seriously the slipperiest roller on any mouse I've ever used; the last one had a nice rubber strip around it
130	pos	Hopefully as it wears it will lose some of this but I may have to disassemble it and buff it up a bit so I can roll it without accidentally clicking all the time
130	pos	You can turn off the clicker so that it's a smooth scroll but that's very sensitive to backwards scrolls so is hard to use in normal situations like web browsing, etc
131	pos	Got this mouse because I can palm a basketball so the 305 felt like a child's toy in my hand
131	pos	A lot of people say this mouse it heavy and I agree, I use it without any weights and it is still twice as heavy as the 305
131	pos	To me, this is fine as I need something heavier or my movements would be uncontrollable
131	pos	Sensor, settings and rbg are all perfect, G-Hub is a great program and lets you set different profiles for each game
131	pos	If you are a bigger or stronger person then I think the weight of the mouse will be fine for you, smaller people might want to look for the ultralights or the 305 series
131	pos	I got this mouse on sale for about $27, I would not pay the full price because you can often find it on sale and at full price I think the g-pro is a better choice
132	pos	I mainly play FPS games and wanted a mouse for the extra buttons that would be advantageous in the heat of the moment
132	pos	At first was very unenthusiastic about the scroll wheel, i would constantly hit the wrong side rather the traditional middle, however after dozens of hours i figured a different use and surprisingly like the scroll wheel feature of being clicked to the left-rightThat being said, as much as i like the mouse for gaming, there are some drawbacks
132	pos	Like the software that i needed to download, very unintuitive, i am in the process of having to open the app everytime i want to game
132	pos	So that the buttons i remapped would register in game
132	pos	thats sorta a hassleThe feel of the mouse is very odd for fps games, ive learned to like it, but its still an odd feeling compared to my old steelseries and redragon ones
132	pos	Overall, good mouse, not great, but good
133	pos	Features include infinite scroll with a switch, programmable buttons on the side, large DPS controls for ADS switching
133	pos	No complaints so far, I prefer all the weights in, as I have larger hands, and having more weight makes it smoother, I don't feel like I'm going to throw the mouse by accident
133	pos	Cable seems to be high quality, With the adjustable DPS and colors, it's fairly customizable as well
133	pos	Some may not like this feature, but when you change your profile to switch the DPS it pops up as an alert, I'm sure it's something you can disable as well, but it tells you the current DPS setting, so its faster than looking at the LEDs on the mouse for reference
133	pos	Great mouse so far
134	pos	Bought this to replace the older version of this mouse
134	pos	My only gripe about these mice is that they're a bit small for my style of mouse use
134	pos	They don't really make big fat mice anymore, so I make do
134	pos	This works great at a good price
134	pos	This mouse is wired, which I prefer, and only has a single place that lights up
134	pos	Logitech typically makes a pretty solid product without getting ridiculous
134	pos	More power to those that like the higher end stuff, I just don't have much need for it
134	pos	Mouse pretty much feels and acts the same
134	pos	Body seems to be the same, just some upgraded components, which is just fine
134	pos	I knew exactly what to expect and got just that and then some
134	pos	Good times
135	neg	I bought this as it was rated good, but was cautious as my other logitech mice and tracballs were really iff as to quality
135	neg	sadly this was worse than the others, within 8 hours of gaming the scroll wheel jad lost it click stops and had shorted the side wheel switches
135	neg	Gaming with it was impossible as if the mouse was moves it set off all the other actions i didn't want, causing me to die consistantly
135	neg	I went from distance to mouse look in the middle of a fight in and out
135	neg	This is useless and I would recommend buying a "Red Dragon" mouse any day of the week, as they are much better quality
135	neg	I have used them and their keyboards for years gaming and have always been satisfied
135	neg	I will also be ignoring some of the you-tubers that recommend this product as they were obviously swayed by the mouse being given to them
135	neg	This mouse is a piece of junk
136	pos	The media could not be loaded
136	pos	Cons:doesn't always automatically select people when opening game
136	pos	This feature Works about 30% of the time
136	pos	-high pricetag for valuePros:-aesthetically pleasing, love the scroll wheel lock/freespin mechanism-feels good in my hand, i wear size large glovesConclusion:Great to look at and very promising features with the macros and button assignment with Logitech software
136	pos	No manual included, only a website address
136	pos	$70
136	pos	00 price is steep
136	pos	I was dissatisfied with the unreliable connection given that the other two wired mouses i have do not experience this issue
136	pos	I would recomend this over the more affordable alternatives out there on amazon only if you are a serious pc gamer
136	pos	The easy to assign buttons are why i wanted this - for fortnite
136	pos	Thank you for reading,Timothy
137	pos	As a girl, I never thought I'd worry about the size of my hands
137	pos	but it's important when choosing a gaming mouse
137	pos	I bought this as a lightning deal for $39
137	pos	So, 40 bucks is a fair price point for this mouse - a separate software download from the internet makes it completely customizable to your liking
137	pos	This is both a pro and con b/c 1) I hate bloatware from an internet download and 2) I can spend hours setting it up when I'd rather be gaming
137	pos	The weights that come with it are nice quality
137	pos	The regular price is somewhere around $60-$70
137	pos	I'd say forget that
137	pos	Pros include weights you can add/subtract, DPI options, and LED lights with option to sync with other Logitech products
137	pos	Cons: Too big for my hand, lack of control b/c of overall size
137	pos	PS I learned after my purchase there is a mid-size version of this mouse
138	neg	When I received the product I was fairly ecstatic about it considering I haven't bought a gaming mouse for quite some time
138	neg	In the first thirty minutes, having to install g hub and configuring the mouse seemed to be a pain in the rear considering that options and changes I've made weren't functioning correctly and did not fully implement itself into the mouse
138	neg	Cases of this were changing the functionality of some buttons on the mouse as provided by the software (g hub) and the dpi of the mouse
138	neg	While these nuances were frustrating and tedious, it did not attract much annoyance and dissatisfaction as it did whenTHE MOUSE WOULD PERIODICALLY STOP FUNCTIONING IN MOVEMENT DESPITE OTHER BUTTONS WORKING AS INTENDEDI'm not sure whether this is a shipment issue that damaged the product, which is unlikely considering the package was pristine, or simply a defective product that was sent to me
138	neg	Either case this should not be an issue when spending $80 on a advertised high quality mouse
138	neg	Honestly disappointing
138	neg	Best part of the mouse was the mouse wheel which I had a lot of fun just spinning
138	neg	The mouse functions and works as best as my 6-8 month old mouse
138	neg	Buy something cheaper
138	neg	Probably won't buy from logitech anymore after this purchase
139	pos	Gaming and working from home these days, and this mouse handles it all
139	pos	For work you can setup several macros to get stuff done (set up two buttons for Cut & Paste for instance
139	pos	Do NOT use it for in game macros
139	pos	You will get booted from most games for cheating, or so I read
139	pos	The keyboard I bought is also a Logitech, and the G Hub software that goes with these devices is excellent
139	pos	LED patterns that go across each in sequence, or separate (up to you)
139	pos	The adjustable mouse sensitivity really helps with aiming in games, and with crossing 3 monitors for work getting done quickly
139	pos	Only issue I have had, and it didn't effect any operation is that the magnetically attached bottom has fallen off a couple of times without me noticing during very intense games
139	pos	I found it jammed up under my keyboard
139	pos	LOLYou can even adjust the weight of the mouse with weights that come with it and fit into the base seamlessly
139	pos	Awesome
139	pos	Gold Standard
140	pos	I read through some of the user reviews and watched some video reviews on this before I purchased
140	pos	I've owned many Logitech high-end gaming mice (and general Logitech mice) in the past
140	pos	When my G700S of old was having double-click issues, I bought a Roccat Nyth
140	pos	The bigger and wider nature of the mouse took a little getting used to (with the wide right-side grip on)
140	pos	I fell in love with the width and generally larger size to fit my larger hands
140	pos	However, it has built up its share of dirt and grime in rather hard to reach places in the years I've owned it
140	pos	The interchangeable and customizable thumb buttons are a very nice feature, except for the fact that the blank covers wobble detracting from the otherwise solid feel of the mouse
140	pos	I figured I'd give Logitech another try bearing in mind the biggest nagging drawback to my old G700S was the wobbly and loud scroll wheel
140	pos	My Nyth has a tactile bumpy scroll wheel that have grown to love a lot and its quiet
140	pos	The G502 Hero's is not quiet and it is still wobbly, just like my old G700S of old
140	pos	In fact the only Logitech gaming mouse from past experience that didn't have a wobbly scroll wheel was the G7
140	pos	The scroll wheel on the Hero is not only wobbly, but the tactile actuation force difference between left tilt and right tilt is significant
140	pos	In that right tilt is so easy to accidentally hit whereas left tilt requires quite a bit more force to actuate
140	pos	This scroll wheel feel has been mostly the same throughout the various mice Logitech has made that have featured a hyperscroll wheel (you click a switch to switch between smooth scrolling and notched scrolling)
140	pos	I guess in the intervening 3 years since I've owned a Logitech gaming mouse, this has not changed
140	pos	Their mouse wheel is still the same wobbly protrusion
140	pos	Sadly, the scroll wheel tactility and overall polish (or lack thereof) is enough for me to decide to return it after only just picking this up from the Amazon locker only an hour ago
140	pos	Well that and the lack of any additional grips, though I won't hold the grip against it
140	pos	The Nyth's interchangeable grips are featured in very few mice
140	pos	For the $75 that this mouse was, I feel the mouse wheel could have been improved considering that they've had this mouse wheel hyperscroll feature for nearly 10 years now
140	pos	Going to give the Roccat Leadr a try considering how much i like my Nyth
140	pos	If only the Nyth came in a wireless variant with more solid (less wobbly thumb buttons and covers/spacers)
140	pos	TLDR: -2 stars for wobbling scroll wheel
140	pos	Right tilt too easy to trigger
140	pos	Wheel scrolling in notched mode is very loud, as loud as my Kaihl brown keyboard switches
141	pos	Pros:- Onboard memory (can pretty much carry my settings over to my work PC)- Customizable DPI, lighting, and buttons- Multiple profiles (configs you can cycle through)- Spinning scroll wheel with toggle button- Easily accessible DPI switch on the side (great for FPS games)Cons:- Noticeably small if you have large hands
141	pos	If you're wondering, it is smaller than the Logitech MX mice (which I like for their size)
141	pos	My measurements (finger tip to palm x palm including thumb): 7" x 4"- G-Hub: I could rant about this but I'll keep it brief
141	pos	Although I haven't had any of the horrible experiences I've had in the past with using G-Hub for their headsets where the drivers and G-Hub itself would break with every update, however you absolutely need it to use %100 of the mouse features
141	pos	G-Hub has a subreddit if you want to get an idea of how many products experience breakage with each update (automatic updates can be disabled though)
141	pos	- Spin wheel toggle is kind of hard to click into place compared to the MX mice
141	pos	- Buttons feel kind of cheap
142	pos	When I first had seen this mouse - and the special edition version which is uglier and $15 cheaper right now - I thought it looked extra and ridiculous between the multicolor LED and the weird design and the thumb-rest wing type thing on the side
142	pos	I literally ONLY bought this because the multi-tilt scroll-wheel on my G500S was broken and the mouse was 3 years old so I believe out of warranty
142	pos	That said, it's been smooth as butter from the beginning
142	pos	It does require a newer version of the LGS than older peripherals did, but installing it didn't mess up my G933 or G810 profiles at all - something you should expect but these days you can't
142	pos	The mouse has good weight without the custom weights - which like all Logitech gaming mice come in their own separate case and can be mixed and matched
142	pos	Unlike the MX517, G500, and other previous lines, there is no weight tray - it's built in to the bottom of the mouse
142	pos	Just life the panel on the bottom
142	pos	I personally am not using them
142	pos	This unit definitely has the precision, out of the box, for Photoshop work as well
142	pos	Gaming I honestly haven't noticed a huge improvement but it has stayed the same, and that's all I needed
142	pos	The scroll wheel has the same two modes as the G500 - theres a loud clicky mode with more traction, and a quiet smoother mode for faster scrolling
142	pos	As with other Logitech gaming products, you can turn the LED off completely, or sync it with the LEDs from your other devices
142	pos	I love it and it was on sale for maybe $50 or so, to be honest I don't remember the price because it was low
143	pos	My Proteus crapped out on me after 4 years of excellent service, so I grabbed this to replace it
143	pos	It has the exact same feel as the Proteus
143	pos	Its still heavy, you won't be walking into any FPS league championships with it
143	pos	But you can stay competitive
143	pos	I don't know why they still bother with the weights, like it needs to be any heavier
143	pos	Other games won't be hindered by the weight
143	pos	The base weight cover has a black lip unlike the Proteus's teal lip, but you can use the base cover from the Proteus  on the Hero, transferring that blue aesthetic
143	pos	So you can make this look nearly identical to the Proteus
143	pos	I didn't think I'd care for the RGB as It tends to be dimmer than static lighting and I only want blue, but turns out I can make a better blue from it
143	pos	The Proteus has a lot of green to its blue light, and its actually brighter
143	pos	I really haven't noticed a difference with the improved sensor, I guess I'm just not pro enough to notice
143	pos	It feels exactly like the Proteus, exactly what I wanted
144	neg	I was extremely happy with this mouse for the first couple of months that I had it, until I began noticing an issue with the primary mouse button registering single clicks as two near-instantaneous clicks
144	neg	For anyone who enjoys gaming, they can probably infer that this is a horrible issue
144	neg	For example, if you're using a grappling hook that requires one click, and you're high up risking fall damage
144	neg	Guess what
144	neg	Your grapple hook just went out because your mouse registered two clicks instead of one, and now the cooldown is causing you to fall to your death
144	neg	This isn't an uncommon issue either, and logitech is very well; however, their upper management has put policies in place to make it unreasonably prohibitive to acquire a replacement mouse
144	neg	By the time I was done sending in all of the screenshots of click-register testing, pictures of the mouse and serial numbers, I gave up because I had other things going on in my life to the point where I'd probably pay $40 just to tell Logitech to shove the mouse up a place where no light can be shone
144	neg	From what the Logitech rep told me, the switch issue that is present (and has been present for 1-2+ years) is prevalent in many mouse manufacturers
144	neg	Strange how they haven't implemented a fix yet, though
144	neg	OR offered a better warranty/replacement program that is a *little* bit more accessible
145	neg	Going on 45 days now, 14 emails, a tracking number where nothing has shipped and multiple attempts to resolve a warranty claim, as usual, Logitech simply ignores you as user once they run of excuses in their agent script-book
145	neg	I've been through this twice before with Logitech, so no, this isn't related to our current "unprecedented times" as  both times before I thought this was a fluke - it's not
145	neg	This is Logitech's way of defrauding users out of their warranty, which is to keep dragging things out as long as possible while continuing to make promises with no intention of actually delivering on those promises let alone shipping a warranty replacement
145	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again
146	pos	I bought this on sale and I'll buy Logitech over the flashy garbage that Razer puts out for gamers any day
146	pos	I decided to move on from the Corsair mouse I liked after I went through two in 4 years
146	pos	When a mouse is ~$100 it shouldn't break from moderate use
146	pos	I was looking for something that felt nice and I could stand it breaking in the next two years
146	pos	This feels nice
146	pos	The weight adjustment is a nice feature, and the handful of programmable buttons is great
146	pos	I use various macros or prefer to have some oft-used keys on in reach of my thumb quite a bit
146	pos	The G Hub software is easy to use, so getting all set up the way I wanted took less than 20 minutes
146	pos	After I read another review after thinking the scroll wheel just sucked, I was very satisfied
146	pos	I initially thought there was no tactile feedback to the wheel, but there was a button for it
146	pos	It must have come in one position, or I accidentally hit it, but once I clicked it everything felt great
146	pos	My only other issue is I keep accidentally pushing the DPI shift button at the tip of my thumb consistently
146	pos	I can get used to it and adjust, but it's enough to prevent a full five stars
147	pos	The first thing that I thought when I first used the mouse is it's narrow profile, which is much too narrow for the average man's hands, leaving your pinky and ring finger dragging on the desk or struggling to find room to grip the mouse
147	pos	The RGB LEDs are not all that impressive because only two parts of the mouse light up
147	pos	Most of the buttons are easily accessible without much finger travel though they really missed an opportunity to put buttons on the right side for increased ergonomics
147	pos	The plastic and rubber feel cheap in the palm and what disappoints me the most is the use of rubber in parts of the mouse because the oils on your hand will eventually degrade it (this happened to my other logitech mouse
147	pos	) Another quirk: this mouse is strongly magnetic at the bottom which causes it to stick somewhat to my stainless steel desk
147	pos	This isn't a deal breaker for me because now I don't need to use the weights for added resistance but its still not something you'd expect
147	pos	Negatives aside the mouse works as expected but for the overall build quality I would say it needs to be set at a lower price
148	neg	As a Logitech User I was already satisfied with the G502 Proteus Core though of course over the years the wiring's mesh has frayed so I thought to get a new one and seeing the Hero as only a minor upgrade at a fair price than my original purchase I proceeded to grab it
148	neg	It feels great, nostalgic for Proteus Core users and of course with the extra DPI range can make gaming rather engaging albeit a little bit
148	neg	For the time being, I enjoy it and would be open to see what else Logitech would do to top it off
148	neg	UPDATE: So a notable error has occurred that I felt should be brought up to which I have not found a "reliable" solution to yet
148	neg	In short, over the past couple months I've noticed an odd increase in input from the mouse (sudden multi-clicks) when I was playing Osu
148	neg	(Rhythm Game I occasionally play) as the ripple indicator as well my Mouse Key Input Tab was registering more hits than usual, even when Click+Dragging for the game
148	neg	Before this, I was having some similar issues while playing games on my emulator where my click and drag would reset and interrupt the gameplay
148	neg	The notable bit is the pressure put on the mouse whether it be lightly pressed or firmly pressed and even after testing the hardware with a click test it now registers that every 10/100 Clicks a double input would occur if pressed lightly though when "mashing" the results increase (20-24/100 Clicks) which has me puzzled at what needed to be done
148	neg	Overall, the mouse is "usable" though for high intensity applications that require precision and such I would not recommend grabbing this mouse as its lifespan was barely over a year and not at all satisfactory for the consumer
148	neg	UPDATE: So I attempted to rectify the issue again though after some more time had passed, there is a notable hardware issue with this mouse where your "left" clicks registers multiple times with it's sensitive clicking which is a hinderance to "active" games like Osu
148	neg	which require precise clicks and dragging at high speeds
148	neg	Even playing on emulators is stifling to do where you have to resort to registering your main clicks with the "right" button instead of the usual left button
148	neg	DO NOT PURCHASE THISUnless you're willing to adapt to its faults
149	pos	The media could not be loaded
149	pos	So far the 502 is living up to the high logitech standards I'm used to
149	pos	I needed a replacement for my old G402, the left button switch was randomly double clicking on single press
149	pos	The 402 lasted me a few years and I was sad to see it go
149	pos	Just like the 402, the 502 Hero is good for people with larger hands
149	pos	It's slightly smaller as you can see in my pics, but hardly noticeable
149	pos	The buttons schemes are almost identical which made the transition to the 502 seamless
149	pos	The shape of the mouse is comfortable and easy to get used to
149	pos	The thumbrest is large which may take up some real estate, so beware of you have limited space
149	pos	One thing I'm a little apprehensive about is the scroll wheel
149	pos	It rattles around and seems to shake the entire mouse when scrolling in regular mode, not hyperfast mode (free spin)
149	pos	Also the left and right wheel tilt buttons have too much play
149	pos	This may or may not be a problem in the future but I didn't take a star away because it's only slightly annoying
149	pos	I'll update if it gets worse
149	pos	The feet seem good it glides across my mousepad with ease
149	pos	There is slightly more friction than my old 402, but that may just be because it's not broken in yet
149	pos	All in all it seems like a good buy, but if you get it on sale then it's almost a MUST buy
149	pos	There are enough features for the hard core gamer and it's easy and comfortable enough to use for the average gamer
150	neg	Be aware that the double click issue may not be the hardware, other words the internal micro switch
150	neg	The driver, that G Hub software (Logitech Gaming) is way over-bloated for what it does, and can cause all kinds of system problems because it tries to be Jack of all trades to act as a driver for other Logitech peripherals also and the installed software size is massive, over 300 Mbs
150	neg	So, what I do is use the G Hub for button assignments making sure the setting are saved in the on board (mouse) memory, and immediately uninstall G Hub
150	neg	The rest of the fine tuning can be done in the Windows muse settings, including setting the double-click timing to the longest possible
150	neg	Your mileage may vary, but the accidental double-click errors are very frustrating with this otherwise very nice mouse
151	pos	Upgraded to this from a G500s
151	pos	I wasn’t sure if I’d like the DPI shift button or not, and figured I’d just re-bind it to another function, but I actually like it
151	pos	I wish this had one more thumb button, as I tend to bind this to the “inventory” of the games I play
151	pos	The cable is super flexible, so it doesn’t “spring” the mouse when you let go of it, like my old mouse occasionally did
151	pos	The mouse works with G Hub for programming macros and such, which is miles ahead of the Logitech gaming software in terms of creating macros and other keybinds
151	pos	The mouse has a decent weight to it without using the supplied weights, but that’s personal preference
151	pos	The mode wheel is a little too stiff for my liking, it really ka-chunk ka-chunks into the detents
151	pos	I have rather large hands and it fits nice in my hand
151	pos	All of the buttons are reachable for me
152	neg	Bought this mouse in hopes to use it and program it for gaming
152	neg	Turns out the onboard memory cannot be programmed for macros or most other useful functions
152	neg	These functions are only available if you have G Hub open at ALL TIMES, which is very annoying
152	neg	This means if you do not have G Hub installed on any of the devices you plan on using this with, it will only do the basic functions of a mouse
152	neg	I tried calling support only to find myself talking to someone who barely spoke English, and he couldn’t give me a good answer on why I can’t program a macro onto my mouse
152	neg	I would recommend going with something else like a Red Dragon gaming mouse, which can do all of these functions with the onboard memory for way less of the cost
152	neg	Unless Logitech is able to fix this with an update, I would not recommend this mouse to anyone
152	neg	Buyer beware
153	neg	Low quality materials
153	neg	The wheel barely lasted a month and is now a weighted fly wheel
153	neg	It's too easy to press the extra buttons near your thumb and mapping them is not intuitive
153	neg	So you end up just unintentionally increasing the DPI setting to ridiculously high settings forcing you to somehow open the utility to fix it
153	neg	Yeah, the software sucks too
153	neg	The only thing decent about this is the magnetic bottom
154	neg	This mouse is super comfortable and fit my hand very well
154	neg	Problem is the main right button was very finicky
154	neg	I need to right click and hold the button for my games to aim and it the mouse would act like I wasn't holding the button down
154	neg	I'd click and hold and it would act like I just clicked sometimes id have to click and hold 2,3,4,5 times before it would work right and let me aim
154	neg	I tried to contact logitech but they can't be bothered to answer the phone or get back to an email
154	neg	The only fix I could find was to pull the button up gently and then press it back down hard and that fixed it for a while
154	neg	But it started doing it again a few weeks later and while trying to fix it myself again it finally broke
154	neg	Definitely not happy with it and even less pleased with logitechs lack of customer service
154	neg	Definitely won't be buying any more of their products
155	neg	I've purchased Logitech products since the 90s and have been an avid game, and they are always known for having top quality egonomics
155	neg	The g502 does not meet my expectations in for a daily use nor gaming mouse
155	neg	I have small hands, and this mouse is actually too small for my palm that i'm actually squeezing my fingers to grip the mouse--this will be an even bigger issue for larger hands
155	neg	Secondly, they sacrificed comfort and ergonomics and tried to make it look futuristic and stylish
155	neg	They put an a steeper incline at the index finger, which is not the correct shape for your hands
155	neg	Also the scroll wheel on free mode is unusable, and on click mode is very clunky and inaccurate
155	neg	It's a very cheap and inaccurate wheel to control, and their gaming software gives no options to change this
155	neg	If you don't mind wireless options I would recommend looking at either the g602 or g604
156	pos	Update: My prior Chinese manufactured G502 Hero died on me after I dropped it a few too many times
156	pos	Took about a year and several drops from standard table height
156	pos	If you are boycotting China products, then you'll be happy to know that the G502 is now being manufactured in Malaysia
156	pos	Update: The entire process took about 14 days, but I did receive a replacement mouse under the two-year warranty for the item
156	pos	I am not sure what happened to my prior mouse; it could have been used as I didn't inspect it closely for fingerprint smudges or tampering
156	pos	Make sure that you do your due diligence regarding that inspection
156	pos	Ultimately, Logitech did the right thing and sent me a new mouse under the warranty program
156	pos	Other than the failure of the prior G502 Mouse I had purchased, this mouse is the best I have used to this date
156	pos	I hope it doesn't spontaneously burn out after the warranty period ends
156	pos	This mouse was fantastic
156	pos	The key word is: was
156	pos	After owning this mouse for a total of two months, it is no longer fantastic
156	pos	The mouse died on me without explanation
156	pos	There is no conceivable reason for it having done so
156	pos	It just suddenly connected and disconnected to my PC randomly before refusing to connect or power on ever again
156	pos	I tried multiple USB ports
156	pos	I tried everything
156	pos	Other mouses work
156	pos	This one does not work anymore
156	pos	And, unfortunately, it died before I could return it
156	pos	Here is a description of exactly what happened and my diagnostic attempts to correct the problem: "The mouse suddenly and inexplicably began intermittently turning on and off disconnecting and reconnecting from my PC
156	pos	The lights on the mouse were erratic and not working properly
156	pos	The mouse connected for a few minutes but the laser tracker was not functioning on the bottom of the mouse
156	pos	It would not work
156	pos	I tried all the USB ports
156	pos	None worked for the mouse
156	pos	I tried a new mouse
156	pos	The new mouse worked perfectly fine in the same USB ports
156	pos	The problem was with the G502 Hero mouse that suddenly died after I unplugged it the first time to try another port
156	pos	It never turned on again and remained disconnected
156	pos	Something short-circuited inside the mouse; it is a hardware issue
156	pos	"I will update this review should Logitech do the right thing and make good on their warranty
157	pos	After the LMB switch broke in my old G602 (which is the second time this has happened to me with Logitech mice), I decided to try a wired one
157	pos	The good: the mouse fits my hand quite well, and it glides very nicely
157	pos	The bad: the mouse buttons take almost no effort to click - maybe half the effort compared to G602, so I end up clicking both buttons instead of one pretty often
157	pos	Also, although I like being able to switch between the clicky and smooth motion of the wheel, the clicky mode is too loud, much louder than G602
157	pos	Finally, the back / forward side buttons are hard for me to tell apart by touch, and I have to shift the hand to reach the back one, which is not great as I use them in games
157	pos	Bottom line, I am returning this one and will look for something that fits my needs better
158	pos	I was using a Wireless G700
158	pos	It was a great mouse
158	pos	It was a getting a little laggy for me and i decided to upgrade
158	pos	There is a wireless version of the G502 but it cost a lot more
158	pos	The fact was that i left my G700 wired up most of the time
158	pos	So i bought the G502
158	pos	It is fantastik
158	pos	It is very responsive
158	pos	I liked the 4 button layout on the G700 on the left side
158	pos	That was my one reservation versus really only 3 on the G502
158	pos	I love the left thumb button on the G502 which the G700 did not have
158	pos	I do not know why they could not have kept the 4 buttons on the G700 and just added the thumb button on the G502
158	pos	I find the that i do not use the G6 and G7 buttons much yet
158	pos	Maybe i will in the future when i get used to this more
158	pos	It took me a little time to get used to the new software but it is ok
158	pos	It is a great mouse

159	pos	finally of several years out of warranty is finally breaking down
159	pos	Missing a foot, right button barely registers the click
159	pos	So, after digging through a whole bunch of sites about best mice - I found this mouse to be most consistently rated among several reviewers
159	pos	It's a little smaller than the old one, but fits my hand better, even though I have big hands
159	pos	I love the feel of the body, Very smooth
159	pos	The response of the mouse is fantastic, but I still am learning what setting to use
159	pos	Also getting use to the wheel, definitely a different feel from the old one
159	pos	Over-all I believe this was a good buy - I actually got this here at a really good discount
159	pos	I've used Logitech in the past - rollerballs, and my very old flight stick so I know quality is there
159	pos	I recommend this for the casual gamer - I have to try it with a FPS soon
160	pos	The first mouse that was shipped to me had a loose scroll wheel (a common problem, apparently) that was overly sensitive to left scroll clicks to the point where I couldn’t use the middle mouse button without accidentally pressing the left scroll button accidentally much of the time
160	pos	Amazon replaced the mouse and amazingly had the replacement at my door within hours
160	pos	The replacement’s scroll wheel is noticeably better, but then I noticed another defect on the first mouse that didn’t catch my attention initially
160	pos	The replacement mouse has four pads/feet on the bottom, whereas the initial mouse only has three—it’s missing the thin pad right below the G502 Hero logo
160	pos	But here’s the kicker: the pad on the replacement mouse was misaligned and sticking up at its smallest point
160	pos	I was easily able to pull it off and glue it into its proper place, but now the lack of replacement pads—which should come standard with mice in this price range—worries me
160	pos	The G502 Hero is a great mouse design, but unfortunately I’m not convinced it’ll last very long
161	neg	I have been through 3 of these G502 mice in the last year and a half
161	neg	All of them suffer from defective clickers
161	neg	The left and right mouse buttons will often extra click, when you only want to click once
161	neg	Or if you hold down the button it thinks you only wanted to click it once
161	neg	Claiming a warranty on the mice is a terrible process and takes months, and only after their support makes you jump through 100 troubleshooting steps, and require you to video record you destroying the mice
161	neg	This is such a common problem for G502's that it has turned into a JOKE
161	neg	Logitech should be ashamed of their disgusting product reliability
161	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again, I am moving over to Corsair for everything
161	neg	Stay away from Logitech products, you have been warned
162	neg	This was a replacement for an older Logitech wireless gaming mouse that's no longer available
162	neg	I have been buying Logitech products since the company started in the 1980s and have owned many Logitech mice
162	neg	I purchased this in October of 2019 as an upgrade to an older Logitech G700 which is no longer available
162	neg	I initially liked the mouse
162	neg	It has good set of features and I liked the overall design, however after a couple of months I began to have problems with intermittent operation of the right mouse button
162	neg	At times, when I held down the button it would send random click up and down events
162	neg	If I pressed harder they would often stop so it was obvious that the switch was malfunctioning
162	neg	I contacted Logitech and after troubleshooting the problem they sent me a replacement mouse
162	neg	Over the last couple of weeks the replacement has begun to exhibit the same problem
162	neg	A quick internet search reveals that this seems to have been a common problem with this model since its release which Logitech has not fixed despite a large number of complaints
162	neg	At this point it seems like a waste of time to request another replacement since it seems like;y that it too will fail
162	neg	I will think twice before purchasing another Logitech product in the future
163	neg	I wanted to replace my Corsair M65 after the left button sometimes does not work
163	neg	I've only used Corsair for about 10 years now and I remember Logitech being a decent company for gaming peripherals
163	neg	oh how the mighty have fallen
163	neg	It's extremely cheap plastic, I feel like this thing is going to break in my hands, I found myself treating it like a priceless artifact
163	neg	The buttons move around and feel and sound so cheap, just that typical cheap plastic sound you get from toys at the Dollar Store
163	neg	The weights don't fit well inside the mouse, I picked up the mouse to move it and the cheap bottom feel out as well as two weights
163	neg	I'd had enough of this mouse after a night's worth of gaming when the adhesive at the top used to promote frictionless movement started to peel off and scratch my mouse pad
163	neg	I immediately had enough, packaged it back up the way it came and started the refund process
163	neg	Corsair, if you're reading this, please please please just fix the left click issue and you still have the best gaming mouse on the market
163	neg	Logitech
163	neg	I'm speechless, I'm not sure how this could be one of the most sold gaming mice on the market
163	neg	With that much money you should be able to engineer a solid product
163	neg	I won't be going back to this company
164	pos	So I've had this mouse for I think just a little over a year and the mouse buttons are already dying
164	pos	I'll be holding the buttons down but inside of a game it'll be registering that I'm not, off and on
164	pos	I swapped to a backup mouse and the issue went away
164	pos	Example, FFXIV -> Pressing both the left and right buttons would 'stutter step' walk, and holding the right-button down to move the camera would stop/start randomly like I stopped holding the button down
164	pos	Doesn't matter how hard I held the button down either
164	pos	It was fantastic while it worked, but I have to dock two stars for not even lasting 2 years
165	pos	Right mouse button randomly sticks or feels like a "short throw" and doesn't fully engage
165	pos	It's damn frustrating for a mouse that costs this much
165	pos	Otherwise, it's a great mouse, comfortable, buttons 4 & 5 conveniently located
165	pos	The "shift" button doesn't get much use, it's rather awkward and nearly pointless
165	pos	The software is OK, but with one game it randomly swaps back and forth between Mouse-4/Mouse-5 and R/T
165	pos	leading to too many unnecessary deaths
165	pos	Overall, because of the expense and the failing mouse button, buy something else
165	pos	Logitech, you've lost another loyal, disappointed customer
166	pos	Day 1 review, so just my initial impressions
166	pos	Pluses: Build quality, weight, button feel are all on point
166	pos	Tracking seems accurate
166	pos	Meh:  It's narrow, not great if you have larger hands (fine if not)
166	pos	Weight is almost too much, even without the (seemingly) unnecessary extra weights (included) that you can install
166	pos	The 'thumb rest' (for right handed people anyway) is weird, though I think with more use it will be fine, maybe even a nice plus
166	pos	Misses:  The mouse wheel
166	pos	It almost feels like an afterthought
166	pos	It's a solid plastic piece, with larger dips that probably double as grip texture and the mechanism to create the stops or 'speed bumps' when you scroll the wheel
166	pos	It has no other texture, isn't rubberized or textured in a way that helps prevent slippage
166	pos	It feels too smooth
166	pos	Couple that with the clunky 'speed bump' mechanism and it makes accurately scrolling the wheel difficult at best
166	pos	Definitely not a high performance feature, and honestly it doesn't work particularly well for normal use
166	pos	Not sure yet if it's a game-breaker, but it's at best a serious oversight
166	pos	I'd love to love this, especially at the price point, but the wheel is such a constant issue that I'm not certain if it's something I can get past
167	pos	good mouse and has what most people need
167	pos	but its not all that great in the hands, my pinkie finger is pushed into a odd place that i dont care much forthe 2 programable buttons on the corner are not useable without taking youre hands off the mousethe metal scroll wheel has more noise then i would care for
167	pos	and the metal ring makes the wheel free spin
167	pos	the scroll wheel also feels chunky
167	pos	not for methe mouse also seems to have some heft to it without the weights installedand it feels cheep overallthe razer deathadder is a overall better mouse if you are looking for somthing  that feels great in the hand
167	pos	mine broke after 3 years but i can see why people put up with it
168	pos	I bought this mostly for FPS games
168	pos	I have to say, it's one of the most ergonomic peripherals I've used, very comfortable
168	pos	The DPI on the fly button is something I'm used to and consider necessary
168	pos	It's pretty good
168	pos	Left and right click are standard, not to tight, not too loose
168	pos	The scroll wheel feels way too loose, regardless of whether the clicker is on or off
168	pos	I am CONSTANTLY hitting the back button and navigating away from whatever page I'm on while browsing
168	pos	I don't really see the use of some of these extra buttons just because it may be awkward to use reliably when they're all on a hair trigger
168	pos	For the price, it's a great mouse and feels really solid
168	pos	That accidental "back" click is my primary annoyance, and I rarely use a scroll wheel outside of browsing online anyway
168	pos	Also appreciate that it only has one small light that will be covered by your hand while in use, and it doesn't shoot out some crazy lazer every time I pick it up
169	neg	I bought this mouse because a few reviews indicated it was both a quality product and comfortable for people with big hands
169	neg	While the former is true, the latter is only partially true
169	neg	I wouldn't call it uncomfortable, but there's something about the angle your hand rests that makes certain actions a little awkward, at least for big hands
169	neg	Trying to mash m1 quickly, for instance, is harder than previous mouses I've owned because pressing down on a slant causes horizontal movement, however slightly
169	neg	It's mitigated somewhat by the curvature of the mouse 1 button, but it's still present
169	neg	Another problem I have is that the DPI adjustment buttons are constantly being pressed by accident, one way or the other
169	neg	There might be a way to lock those down, but that complicates the accessibility of variable DPI, so it's one or the other
169	neg	The G Hub software is bloated and generally unpleasant to use, but required for full functionality
169	neg	After owning the mouse for about six months, the notorious g502 left-click issues began
169	neg	It was spotty for a little while, but now it can't hold a click at all, making it essentially unusable
169	neg	Overall, the mouse looks nice and feels pretty good, but the invasive software and the shoddy craftsmanship on the switches make it not worth the money
170	pos	It's a great mouse, it kills me that the scroll wheel sucks so much
170	pos	It's accurate, the weights system is great, the clicking feels awesome, it has a lot of customizable buttons, all in all it's pretty awesome
170	pos	The scroll wheel is hot garbage
170	pos	It's made of metal, which everyone here seems to love, great, I don't have a problem with that part
170	pos	First issues is that it's SUPER hard to scroll with it, scrolling takes a lot more finger strength than on a regular mouse and that's bad enough, you can turn off the click scrolling for smooth but then you have the problem that it's way too lose
170	pos	The biggest issue I have with it is how insanely sensitive the mouse is when it comes to left and right click on the wheel button
170	pos	This is one of the features I buy mice for because I use it all the time in games and for browsing, but it's INCREDIBLY sensitive on this mouse, I'm constantly click the left click on the scroll wheel when I'm just scrolling and a big part of it is that you have too apply so much strength to the scrolling that it makes you accidentally click all the time
170	pos	I can unbind the left click to avoid this problem, but why would I
170	pos	I literally bought the mouse for that feature
171	pos	I have a medium-sized hand
171	pos	Six and a half inches across
171	pos	Weight and SizeThe G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available
171	pos	However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it
171	pos	In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse
171	pos	This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features
171	pos	The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all
171	pos	The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed
171	pos	I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters
171	pos	Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse
171	pos	With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better
171	pos	I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)ProsRubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnetThe cable is built like a tank
171	pos	No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk
171	pos	The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant
171	pos	The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same
171	pos	Mouse clicks are very light and responsiveThe number of buttons makes it a productivity machineThumbrest is supportiveThe sensor is completely flawless, no odd trackingYou can flex on friends
171	pos	Anymore to be said
171	pos	ConsRGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand
171	pos	When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harshWhen shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattleThe mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dustWhile the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy
171	pos	It also gets in the way sometimes
171	pos	DPI button could be shifted back littleThe optional weights are almost completely uselessPerformanceThe mouse was great to game with, but not perfect
171	pos	The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well
171	pos	The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions
171	pos	The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons
171	pos	The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate
171	pos	However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse)
171	pos	I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse
171	pos	This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse
171	pos	Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons
171	pos	I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form
171	pos	FINAL VERDiCTDon't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it
171	pos	For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse
171	pos	Your experience will be much better
171	pos	But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out
171	pos	Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return
172	pos	I've been using a G702 for many years now, and the switches were starting to go, so it was time to upgrade
172	pos	Well, seeing reviews and knowing some people using this I decided to get it, so I got it and I can say that it's nice, but I like the G702 a lot better
172	pos	Before I go too far, most negatives are about double-clicking, I have not experienced that nor has my friend that is also running this mouse
172	pos	So far, I really do like this mouse, but I do have a few minor grips, and this is what seems to be just on the one I got and not on all
172	pos	But, the textured covering over the weights is dragging on the mouse pad, which means that the skatez on this mouse are too short
172	pos	It's an easy fix to just go out and buy new skatez, but, for a new product, I shouldn't have to yet
172	pos	** (Update, put on new skatez over the ones that came on there and it no longer drags
172	pos	)
172	pos	**Other things I am not a fan of is this mouse is good for smaller hands, I feel
172	pos	Also, the definition between the buttons are not very defined, and I feel you can easily click the wrong button
172	pos	If the mouse was a little wider, I think it would be a bit more comfortable
172	pos	This also may be because I am not use to it yet, but a little bump or something on the buttons along with being a little wider, those two small touches, I feel this could have been a better mouse
173	pos	Overall I'm happy with this mouse
173	pos	It connected easily enough and has a good amount of configurations available with the Logitech software
173	pos	Weights are easy enough to add with a magnetic closure plate to make it sleek
173	pos	Myonly complaint would be for the DPI
173	pos	The two buttons next to the left mouse click, are reserved for on the fly DPI adjustment
173	pos	You can either use them for that or disable them, they are not programmable
173	pos	Why
173	pos	Yes on the fly DPI adjustment is important for some, but why not make them programmable
173	pos	And, why are they so big
173	pos	For DPI adjustments two smaller buttons would have been fine
173	pos	Lastly, these buttons don't have a distinctive feel difference between the two or a separation that you can feel
173	pos	Each time I adjust, I have to look at the mouse
174	pos	This mouse was great the soon I got it
174	pos	3 or 4 months pass, no issue
174	pos	6 months, that's when it appears, the double-clicking
174	pos	And it doesn't seem that I'm the one who keeps getting issues, it's a flaw in the construction
174	pos	It's especially frustrating when trying to work and be productive because the double click causes a lot of issues with editing work or creating assignments
174	pos	And when you're gaming, you're at a major disadvantage because it double clicks more in games than in general use
174	pos	I play fps games most of the time (for example rainbow six siege) and when I try to shoot it stops shooting, it doesn't go full auto, Also for general use, when watching youtube whenever you want to pause it will sometimes put you in fullscreen
174	pos	If you are looking for a similar product to the G502 hero, you're better of with the G502
174	pos	Although the quality of the G502 isn't as superior as this, it at least is a functioning mouse
175	neg	Pros:- Looks cool- Compatible with the same lighting software I already use with my Logitech keyboard- Feels pretty solid/well constructed- I like that I can adjust the weightCons:- Only one, but it's a pretty big one for me: I think this is just me and the way I grip/rest my hand on the mouse, but I am unintentionally left and right clicking ALL THE TIME when I use this mouse
175	neg	It's especially annoying if I'm playing an FPS game or something where left clicking will fire the gun or toss the grenade I'm currently holding, in a game that has friendly fire
175	neg	yeah
175	neg	It feels like the left/right click buttons on this mouse are a lot longer than they were on the G5 (pretty much anywhere above the big letter "G" on the mouse will left/right click)
175	neg	I've been dealing with it and just trying to make a conscious effort to keep my hand off the mouse as much as possible, but I'm probably going to shop around for a different mouse and maybe give this one to a friend or something
175	neg	My old mouse that this one replaced was a Logitech G5 that I'd been using for over a decade, and I never had this problem with it
175	neg	Again, I think it's probably a great mouse, and it's just me and the way I grip the mouse (especially hard to adjust when I'd been using the same G5 for over a decade, I guess), but that problem is making the mouse borderline unusable for me
176	pos	I bought a G502 years ago, when the line first launched, and I loved it
176	pos	I used it for hours each day for those years, and I never regretted that purchase
176	pos	However, a few weeks ago the left mouse button started double clicking
176	pos	I tried it with different computers and reset the settings on the mouse but nothing fixed it
176	pos	It seems the switch is dying
176	pos	I considered repairing it (and I still might), but the cost of parts is about 1/3 of a new mouse and I would also need something more advanced than the Radio Shack soldering iron I have somewhere in a drawer
176	pos	So I bought the new G502 Hero
176	pos	It is every bit as good as the original
176	pos	In fact, they are practically the same mouse from the outside
176	pos	The blue accents are gone from the original, and the logo is different, but otherwise they are identical
176	pos	Of course, the sensor on the Hero is different, having a higher DPI range and requiring less power, but I haven't noticed a difference in my usage, because I typically stay between 1600 and 8000 DPI anyway
176	pos	My only complaint in all of this is the software
176	pos	I really wish there was a way to export settings from one mouse and import them to another, especially two mice which are so similar
176	pos	I had to recreate my profiles manually, which was a pain, but not enough to detract a star
177	neg	Mouse seems to track well and the g hub software is adequate
177	neg	My main issue with this mouse is how easy it is to accidentally bump the dpi change buttons while gaming
177	neg	My older G700s did not have this issue
177	neg	Also the tactile feel of the side thumb buttons is not as good as my older G700s
177	neg	The forward and back buttons are smooth and the feel between them is almost indistinguishable
177	neg	The only reason I switched is the older G700s mouse developed tracking issues after many years of faithful service
177	neg	I will seek out a better alternative as the inadvertent dpi switching is becoming an issue while gaming
178	pos	I'm not a professional gamer or reviewer first of all, and I am not paid for this review
178	pos	However, I have played FPS and MMORPG games on PC since the late 90's
178	pos	This mouse is way more than satisfactory for my preferences, and I am picky about weight, adjustable weights, feet that glide smoothly, supportive software, customization, lighting, scroll wheel functionality, ergonomics, and of course braided cable
178	pos	I'm a little old school so I prefer wired
178	pos	This mouse meets my criteria and expectations, I bought 3
178	pos	Compared to several other more expensive brands, with more complex names and software that actually causes OS issues at times, this works extremely well
178	pos	No brain buy here
179	neg	This thing has been an absolute nightmare since I’ve bought it
179	neg	Holding down the left mouse button and performing things like simple click and drag functions, were close to impossible as the mouse would without warning unclick or register the holding of the mouse as a double click
179	neg	This mouse has cause significant problems when navigating important networking drives for work, as a simple click and drag results in the mouse arbitrarily rearranging my networks as the dragging doesnt complete and suddenly I am moving large sections of my network to other parts within said network due to the dragging being interrupted by the intermittent clicking
179	neg	I found temporary solution by pulling up the left mousing button and attempting to flatten the plastic piece a bit, however this has now resulted in the whole left wing of the mouse snapping off
179	neg	I cannot explain how upsetting this entire ordeal has been for me
180	neg	I'm not the only one with this problem it seems, but the switches in this mouse don't hold up to even light gaming
180	neg	I've had it for 3 months minus a day, and already I have lost the ability to click and drag *at all*
180	neg	Not sometimes
180	neg	It's just borked
180	neg	I also sometimes register clicks as double clicks
180	neg	Overall the left click died far too fast
180	neg	I'll attempt to RMA it, but I'm guessing that these switches just don't stand the test of time
180	neg	Otherwise I like the thing
180	neg	Great ergonomics, great sensor
180	neg	If it could last a couple of years then maybe it'd be worth $50, but
180	neg	This is just straight up unacceptable out of a company as big as Logitech, and a switch that they say will last for 50 million clicks
180	neg	Granted
180	neg	it still clicks
180	neg	Maybe that test doesn't verify at what point the mouse starts accidentally registering double clicks
180	neg	Or when click and hold is lost
180	neg	Either way, no good
181	pos	____________________CONS_____________________weight:This mouse is too heavy for actual competitive gaming
181	pos	When you try to flick with this mouse, chances are you'll overaim and miss due to the leftover inertia the mouse had
181	pos	The fact that logitech would add attachable weights just  blows my mind
181	pos	I've been using this mouse for the better part of a year now, and looking back at it, I regret that I didn't just buy a steelseries mouse instead
181	pos	curvature of the mouse:This could just be a ME problem, but my hands are fairly average-sized
181	pos	This mouse's curvature makes it so that in order to get a comfortable grip, your pinky and ring finger are forced to hang off the side and drag on my desk
181	pos	If logitech added the thumb-rest bit, why couldn't they do the same for the pinky and ring finger
181	pos	reliability:This could also just be a ME problem
181	pos	I game a lot with this mouse, and so far it's held up great
181	pos	However, some days the left mouse button (lmb) and right mouse button (rmb) would just stop working properly
181	pos	For example, spraying a gun in CS:GO
181	pos	If holding down the lmb, it would stutter and would stop shooting mid-spray
181	pos	I've died countless times to this issue, and the same goes the the rmb
181	pos	I don't abuse this mouse, never dropped it from even above KNEE height, and that's coming from a dude who's 5'7''
181	pos	_____________________PROS_____________________extremely customizable:Installing logitech G-hub is little to no hassle, and making macros makes using this mouse extremely fun
181	pos	The feel of the material doesn't feel cheap at all (which for an 80$ mouse should be a given) and the curve of the mouse feels great on my hand
181	pos	visually satisfying:it looks sleek and, for lack of a better word, cool
181	pos	Nothing I could say could possibly change this
181	pos	cool scroll button:you can toggle it between going by intervals or just flat-out spinning like a wheel
181	pos	Pretty useful for any tasks that require spamming inputs really quickly
181	pos	_____________________CONCLUSION_____________________is it worth 80 bucks
181	pos	No
181	pos	You'd be better off buying a lighter mouse from steelseries, or maybe even a logitech g pro wireless when it goes on discount
181	pos	Point is, the g502 hero is one of the worse mice you can get from logitech
181	pos	Not worst, worse
181	pos	Please do yourself a favor and buy a different mouse
182	pos	Simplemente maravilloso, la primera vez que lo tube en mis manos y probe un Shooter con el me sentí desorientado, pero me acostumbre a el rápidamente, los botones para vajar y subir el DPI son la santa leche, me encanto el boton que suelta la rueda del rato, me sirve para desplazarme rapidamente entre contenido
182	pos	Calidad del producto-9/10Rendimiento en juego-10/10(buenisimo si bajas el app y configuras el DPI)Comodidad-8/10(le pondria 10/10,pero el boton de shift DPI esta muy lejos del dedo gordo y eso lo vuelve en su parte un poco inservible)Recomendacion:Si buscas un mouse que te sea util a la hora de jugar un shooter en el cual necesites usar muchos tus reflejo con el mouse(Rainbow six, COD, etc) este es tu mouse
182	pos	9/10
183	pos	Have had this mouse for a couple of years
183	pos	Overall I like it except for the mouse wheel
183	pos	When you are scrolling through things it tends to "jump" really far ahead or really far back and it is incredibly annoying
183	pos	You have to move kind of slow and deliberately and put some pressure on the whell when doing a lot of scrolling
183	pos	And it's doubly annoying when it's on "free" scroll where it doesn't click because every time you take your hand off the scroll wheel it either jumps backwards or it just keeps on scrolling and if I even bump my desk it starts scrolling
184	pos	Pros:1) "Logitech G Hub" desktop application allows to setup lighting effects, DPI sensitivity, button assignment2) You can adjust mouse weight by adding/removing metallic parts to the bottom of the mouse - it has special container for metal weights3) Comfortable claw grip4) DPI settings can be adjusted using buttons on the left on the fly5) Button behind the wheel changes between infinite scroll and a very rigid oneCons: noneSummary: this particular gaming mouse is on par with Razer Basilisk series v1/2/3
184	pos	I can easily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice gaming or regular mouse with additional comfort
185	pos	The Pros:The mouse itself is well built
185	pos	It has quite a few buttons that are somewhat useful in every day life
185	pos	Adjustable DPI settings are an interesting touch, though are troublesome without working software
185	pos	Overall, the feel of the mouse is good, especially if you have larger hands like me
185	pos	I love the dual mode scroll wheel as well
185	pos	That's probably my favorite feature
185	pos	The Cons:LG Hub software is garbage
185	pos	It installed but would not run on my Win 10 x64 PC
185	pos	It's a fairly fresh OS install without any other Logitech software
185	pos	I have tried re-installing several times without any success
185	pos	LGS installed and ran just fine however
185	pos	It's older software but it actually works
185	pos	There isn't any reason for peripheral software to be this troublesome
185	pos	It really doesn't do that much
185	pos	Instructions for the mouse are also quite poor
185	pos	It wasn't obvious what G Shift is for DPI settings or how to adjust the DPI settings with the mouse itself
185	pos	LGS software simplified this a bit
185	pos	Overall, I would recommend this mouse if you find it on sale for under $50
185	pos	The updated Logitech software is trash though
185	pos	Don't bother with it
186	neg	I went with the G502 to accommodate fairly large hands, and it's much better than most of the mice I've tried, but I wish it was still a bit wider
186	neg	The scroll wheel is very loud, probably even louder than Razer's typical sound which I already found too loud, and despite being very new, I'm already seeing the occasional case of the scroll wheel notches getting slightly off of the actual software response, which is what I was replacing my last mouse for in the first place
186	neg	Like every mouse I've tried, this one is good, but not great
186	neg	I had found the perfect mouse at one point, but it was discontinued and replaced with one that's terrible, so I'm using this one for now, and I'm happy enough with it
186	neg	Update: After about 6 months, this mouse has broken in some way that makes it unusable
186	neg	The sensor no longer tracks accurately and something as simple as clicking a link on a web page is nearly impossible due to the random movement it's adding to my motion
186	neg	I still haven't found a mouse that's actually good
187	neg	I used to own the original version of the G502 and has lasted me 5 years with no problems at all
187	neg	I decided it was time for an upgrade to the latest version for the RGB, but this newest version has been extremely disappointing
187	neg	Within a month my left mouse button developed issues that resulted in clicking when there is no input, clicks not registering when there is input, and double clicking when releasing the button
187	neg	I spent 3 weeks with Logitech support to try to get it RMAed and the process was just pain staking
187	neg	I ended up reaching out to Amazon and they very graciously sent me a free replacement and saved me the hassle of having to jump through the numerous hoops with Logitech
187	neg	My replacement mouse is already displaying the same symptoms of the first mouse
187	neg	Less than a month in and I get phantom clicks and unintended double clicks
187	neg	There was a time I swore by Logitech peripherals, but I think it's time to shop for a different brand
187	neg	If you're looking to buy this for gaming, I recommend you look elsewhere
188	pos	I'm a huge Logitech fan but this one is a failure, pretty much anything with the name HERO from them is a ZERO
188	pos	Look up G502 double click on youtube and you will have a plethora of videos to watch, that isn't people making a video to complain that people making a video to show Logitech the mouse they bought last month is busted and they are only doing it for the warranty
188	pos	Its a shame this is a product that is still for sale but if you do go against your better judgment and buy this, register for the warranty the same day you receive it
188	pos	You will thank me next month
189	pos	This mouse has a solid build quality and is comfortable for any grip style
189	pos	I prefer a palm grip but will sometimes use a claw grip and holding the mouse is comfortable either way
189	pos	The G502 is more on the heavy side for a mouse and I don't see a need to use any of the included weights
189	pos	The mass of this mouse could be an issue for some people, as they may notice some fatigue with constantly moving the mouse around
189	pos	I'd say the only issues I've had so far have been getting the cable trained to lay how I want it and acclimating to the scroll wheel being a smooth metal surface rather than rubberized
189	pos	Coming from a G500s, I miss the rubberized scroll wheel but not enough for this to be a major issue for me now that I'm used to the smoother metal
189	pos	The cable takes a few days to fully train, depending on what shape it needs to be
189	pos	Straightening it was simple enough and getting it to maintain a curve wasn't terribly hard
189	pos	Within a week, I had the cable situated mostly how I wanted it
189	pos	Gaming and general usage so far have been great
189	pos	The range of DPI settings mean I can set exactly the speed I want and the DPI switching buttons are great for people who prefer having a few options for movement and aiming
189	pos	The sensor seems to work on just about any normal desk surface
189	pos	I've used mine on a couple mouse pads, wood, and glass
189	pos	So far the only surface I had any trouble with was glass but that was even pretty mild, all things considered
190	pos	This is the best gaming mouse I have ever owned
190	pos	I love the software, buttons, and all the cool stuff you can do
190	pos	The top feature for me in particular is the scroll wheel, which with the press of a button lets you scroll freely instead of having it click in steps
190	pos	I can't go to any other mouse now since to my knowledge none have that feature, and makes me wonder why other brands haven't universally adopted the feature
190	pos	It is essentially, the perfect mouse except as others have mentioned, you are likely to start having problems with the left and right click 'double clicking' on press
190	pos	After hours of searching, I found a fix in a random youtube comment without having to pull the mouse apart by blowing out the left and right buttons, holding them down for 10s, shaking, twisting a bit, then holding down again and shaking some more somewhat carefully without being too rough
190	pos	It seems there must be some dust or grime that gets caught in the clicking mechanisms over time
190	pos	After that it was fixed and I didn't have problems again, but if I do I'll try it again
190	pos	Certainly not a perfect fix and why I knocked off 2 stars on quality of material, but its better than having to switch to a different and inferior mouse
191	pos	A fully programmable mouse with plenty of easy to reach buttons and a fun lighting scheme
191	pos	Sold
191	pos	Logitech still proves they are king of the hill
191	pos	The embedded software is easy to use and low maintenance
191	pos	The mouse feels great and has simple weights that can be added to increase the heft
191	pos	Lots of buttons that can be programmed for intuitive use
191	pos	1 star off for the DPI buttons being to easy to click in between the left click and the back click
191	pos	So all of a sudden having your mouse speed up or slow down means you need to train yourself as to how you position your fingers
191	pos	Beyond that minor qualm, it's a great gaming mouse
192	neg	i don't know who dropped the ball on the click sensors for this iteration of the g502 series
192	neg	i have owned 3 g502 heros in the span of around 8 months with each one having the ending up with the same problem, the right click will begin to freak out; registering several clicks with a single press/hold
192	neg	this makes aiming down sights in games impossible and has remained a consistent issue through out all 3 of the g502 heros I've owned
192	neg	the first one started showing issues 4 months after i bought it
192	neg	i purchased a second mouse to replace it, this time with a warranty
192	neg	that one started acting up 3 weeks later
192	neg	same problem, Spazzy right click
192	neg	i am now on my 3rd mouse
192	neg	i got i for free thanks to the warranty i got with the previous one, and it started acting up a month ago, can you guess what the problem was
192	neg	Yup
192	neg	Spazzy right click
192	neg	honestly i don't really care to buy another mouse, or any product from Logitech going forward
192	neg	the problems i had with this mouse were too consistent to be a coincidence
192	neg	it's a shame too, because this used to be a really good mouse
193	pos	I own a lot of 'gaming' mice and this is the best of the bunch, worth every penny
193	pos	Only issues for me is this mouse is bigger than I expected (doesn't work for my wife, who has smaller hands) and I don't like the placement of the buttons by the thumb
193	pos	I would accidently activate these buttons all the time when I first got the mouse, but eventually got used to it, and realized I had to place my thumb between the buttons and a little bit back from where I would naturally place my thumb
193	pos	Other than that this mouse is outstanding
193	pos	Buttery smooth mouse movements
193	pos	I love the programmability of all the buttons, I love the apps, you can adjust settings to a fine level of detail
193	pos	The craftmanship/feel is top-notch
193	pos	There is a huge difference between this mouse and other cheaper gaming mice, definitely worth the price if it's in your budget
194	pos	* I love that I do I not get occasionally most jumps, jitters or lag like I do with Bluetooth mouse
194	pos	As much as I don't like wires, I've never met a perfect wireless mouse (yet)
194	pos	* The cord is well thought out
194	pos	I don't even notice it most of the time
194	pos	* Smooth as butter
194	pos	Slides like a dream* I love being able to program the exact speed of movement I want (I'm insanely picky)
194	pos	* Not just great for gaming, but also great for photo editing
194	pos	I'm always doing very tiny meticulous details & no other mouse has been good for that except this one
195	neg	The mouse itself is okay
195	neg	But the LED for the logo which you can change doesn't show pure white color
195	neg	It has blue tone of color added to the white color and comes out in this weird color
195	neg	(I don't even know how I should call it)And the Logitec software doesn't give you much you could do with the LED
195	neg	One solid color, rainbow or off
195	neg	That's it
195	neg	No patterns or anything
195	neg	There's no pattern to choose even if you set it to one color
195	neg	So if you are planning to change the LED to white color, consider other brand
196	pos	I am not a hardcore gamer, so I do not take advantage of the full customizing features for this mouse
196	pos	However, I do love what I have customized with the settings for my regular day-to-day uses
196	pos	I like that I can add weights to the mouse
196	pos	The mouse is very responsive when I click around
196	pos	I did discover with this mouse the delight of having a scroll wheel that you can change how it scrolls
196	pos	Overall, an excellent mouse worth the price point of $40
196	pos	Don't pay over that
196	pos	Also, the pleasure of making the DPI setting faster than what the computer's DPI setting is maxed out at is great
197	neg	*Update* I got a replacement mouse, and after about 5 months of use, it no longer registers left clicks consistently
197	neg	This is a garbage product, especially since its marketed to the FPS market
197	neg	I'm unable to play FPS at all anymore; I can hold my button down using an automatic weapon, and it will fire a SINGLE shot
197	neg	This mouse has been a waste of time, money, and energy
197	neg	I'm not going to bother trying to get a 3rd mouse
197	neg	This is a garbage product
197	neg	I bought this mouse on March 29 of 2019, and its already having a lot of problems
197	neg	I enjoyed it while it worked, but it has slowly stopped doing that
197	neg	Sensor and most of the buttons work fine, but the left mouse button is not working properly
197	neg	It will either register a click, double click, no click, or 'unclick' when holding the button down
197	neg	Its sorely disappointing after only having it for a year
197	neg	So far its impeding my workflow and ability to game properly, and Logitech Support has been startlingly unhelpful (its still under warranty)
197	neg	None of the problems I'm facing are isolated or rare: google search results will tell you as much
197	neg	Lots of people on tech forums are exacting the same frustrations
197	neg	I ordered a Corsair Scimitar Pro to replace this
197	neg	After 15 years of using Logitech mice, ever since the launch of the gaming brand, with the G5, I've decided to go elsewhere
197	neg	If you're mulling this model over: look elsewhere
197	neg	Its an endemic issue for this particular model
198	pos	I play Call Of Duty Modern Warfare, COD WWII, Modern Warfare 2, Black OPS 4 and this mouse is very comfortable
198	pos	Many complain that this mouse is heavy, but it doesn't feel heavy to me
198	pos	I guess it all comes down to personal preference
198	pos	This mouse has on-board memory, which let's you save your configuration into it
198	pos	This is nice, since I don't want to always run the Logitech software, and it's good for when you use this mouse on another computer and don't have the software there
198	pos	Anyways, I only created one profile with it and I have my lowest DPI to 400
198	pos	That's what I use for FPS games
198	pos	Then I set another DPI to 1200, which I use for when I am browsing the Internet
198	pos	With this mouse, it's so easy to change DPI with the DPI buttons
198	pos	Since my DPI is already set, I am free to delete the Logitech software
198	pos	If you are gaming on a Linux computer, you can always set your mouse settings through a Windows PC or a Virtual Machine
198	pos	It's a plus that it has on-board memory
198	pos	The side buttons are very tactile and feel really solid
198	pos	Also, the left and right mouse click buttons have very low travel time and feel very responsive
198	pos	I got big hands and play claw style
198	pos	I highly recommend this mouse for anyone that has big hands
199	pos	i purchased this product in may of 2019 bc people were giving it good reviews
199	pos	the same people also tried to say the mouse looked "cool" so i should have known from there they were poor sources
199	pos	Tried it for a month and realized it was too small for my hands and the "sniper" button wasn't given much thought to its placement
199	pos	The build quality felt cheap especially when it came to the rattling of the mouse wheel
199	pos	So i bought the newer m65 corsair and put the g502 on the shelf as a backup if my corsair ever went down
199	pos	Well last month my corsair bit the dust and a new one is on the way
199	pos	Corsair has great CS from my experience
199	pos	Well since I procrastinated i had to use the g502 for the month and at the end of that month the left click feature started to double left click aprox
199	pos	2 out of every 5 attempts
199	pos	To sum it up, the mouse is ugly, cheap, looks like it was made for a child gamer to beg his parents to buy for them bc it looks futuristic and has a high DPI
199	pos	But anyone beyond the age of 15 knows both of those things are pointless when it comes to having a solid mouse
199	pos	BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, the left click feature started failing after a little over 2 months of use
199	pos	This mouse is good if you have tiny hands and like to have 50 different dpi settings accessible at your fingertips
199	pos	I have no idea why someone would need that many dpi settings or a 16000 dpi max
199	pos	I put in a request for a new g502 bc its still covered under warranty
199	pos	I will update this post once said company responds
200	pos	Logitech makes really good computer accessories
200	pos	I bought two of these for my kids for Christmas who are all into playing computer games
200	pos	They watch these professional gamers who are using items like this and as a result think they need it too for better gaming
200	pos	They were all excited when they saw I got them this mouse but after a few days of using it I could tell they were not all that impressed
200	pos	It lights up and looks cool, but it is ultra sensitive
200	pos	Even if you adjust your sensitivity or add some of the weights the mouse comes with it is still really sensitive
200	pos	Maybe my kids just aren't good gamers, but they prefer my cheap Logitech wireless mouse over this one
200	pos	For the price, I would not buy it again
201	pos	The Logitech G502 in my opinion, is one of the best mice on the market you would ever get
201	pos	Every button on the mouse is programmable, but there are 5 extras that you can use for DPI or macros
201	pos	You have to download either Logitech Gaming Software, or Logitech G Hub to assign the macros to your mouse
201	pos	The ergonomics of the mouse are really good
201	pos	I can keep a really good grip on the mouse, and its textured rubber on the sides help with gripping
201	pos	I have quite large hands, and it still works flawlessly for me
201	pos	Only thing is, depending on the person it might take some getting use to when you first use the mouse, as your hand might feel placed odd
201	pos	People typically categorize how you hold the mouse in three types, palm, claw or hybrid
201	pos	I personally use a hybrid grip on my mouse, for most control
201	pos	It has a really large range for DPI, but of course most gamers don’t use so high of a DPI speed, and it is only a marketing gimmick for your mouse to be that high
201	pos	The mouse has on-board memory in case of no internet or if you need to play somewhere other than your house
201	pos	It only saves your RGB profiles and your sensitivity/DPI profiles
201	pos	This mouse cannot save macros onto the onboard memory
201	pos	The RGB lighting of the mouse is lackluster, but that is fine by me
201	pos	It has lightning for the Logitech logo itself, and the DPI lighting on the side
201	pos	RGB for me is not a must, and is only a nice edition to have
201	pos	Now the most important thing, the weight
201	pos	This mouse weighs 125g, and comes with metal weights to make it heavier if wished
201	pos	Personally, I keep it right at 125 grams in order to keep it down, but for me it actually doesn’t matter
201	pos	Some people might steer clear of this mouse because of that, and if you like lighter mice, this one isn’t for you
201	pos	The weight actually comes in advantage for me, as the weight of the mouse balances the speed at which I move it
201	pos	There is one issue that is common for the mouse, and that is the dreaded double-click issue that occurs with the G502
201	pos	The switches for the buttons may begin to register two presses
201	pos	You can actually use the software to fix the issues, but that takes the use of macros away from you
201	pos	Overall this mouse is a godsend, and is what made me use Logitech for all of my peripherals
202	pos	I've had so many of these G502 mouses, reason being why so many is in the span of about 5-6 years
202	pos	The mouse is great for small/med hands, its ergonomic, feels great can adjust the weight
202	pos	The Logitech Gaming Software is also amazing, no issues
202	pos	set up macros, keybinds etc, change DPI on the fly of a button
202	pos	The only issue i have is a bit with the build quality its mostly plastic which is fine it has a decent feel for durability for a few months for me personally the side rubber grips get worn out so i end up buying a replacement
202	pos	But other than that i highly recommend it
202	pos	Overall 5 stars
203	neg	This product has a massive design flaw
203	neg	Logitech choose to go with cheap Chinese switches for this mouse and in a short period of time the switches are going to break
203	neg	This causes the LMB and RMB double-click for no reason, a lot of times while still holding the button down
203	neg	Logiyech is well aware of this issues yet they do nothing about it
203	neg	A recall to replace these cheap Chinese switches should be made by Logitech
203	neg	The ergonomics and the sensor are great but not enough to justify buying something only to last a few months or a year
204	pos	This is a great mouse
204	pos	I bought it for gaming, and it is ergonomic and the click of the mouse is just right, not too loud
204	pos	You can quickly interchange between DPI speed with a certain button, so it’s very convenient
204	pos	It has lots of buttons that make navigating your computer a breeze
204	pos	It also comes with some weights that you can put within the mouse to make it heavier or lighter based on what you like
204	pos	This mouse works for drag clicking and the scroll button can click sideways and downward, as well as two scrolling settings, you can make it scroll very fast and smoothly or have normal scrolling
204	pos	Definitely a great buy
205	pos	I've had this mouse now for about 3 weeks
205	pos	This is the first programmable mouse I've ever bought
205	pos	I was very iffy at first because there are so many buttons on most programable mouses so I wanted something that was simple but yet effective for low-end gaming
205	pos	I was pleasantly surprised at how easily I was able to program keys to the mouse via their software which didn't take very long to download
205	pos	I just keep the program up at all times and If I feel like changing a button I can do so in less than 15 seconds
205	pos	You could also close the program and open from your desktop in seconds
205	pos	I have smaller hands for a guy but the mouse still feels great
205	pos	If my hands were a little bit larger it would be perfect
205	pos	I haven't had any mechanical issues
205	pos	All the buttons work well (no double clicking)
205	pos	I love the feature of the mouse wheel where if you push the button in below the wheel, it either opens fully or restricts slightly the motion of the wheel
205	pos	Basically, the one motion is like that of a normal mouse wheel and the other motion scrolls nearly indefinitely depending how fast you spin the wheel
205	pos	It's really cool
205	pos	I noticed that compared to any standard mouse I've ever used, my precision and accuracy of mouse movements has been greatly increased when using this mouse
205	pos	I noticed this especially while gaming
205	pos	I haven't messed around with the weights, but you can add/remove weights to make the mouse heavier/lighter
205	pos	I'm just not interested in that and adapted to the default from delivery
205	pos	The lighting options on the mouse are cool but that's just supplemental
205	pos	It's everything else about the mouse that I like
205	pos	I mean, we don't really look at our hand while we are on the computer much do we lol
205	pos	Overall, It's a great mouse
205	pos	I was worried about double-clicking that I read in some other reviews, but I haven't noticed that
205	pos	I will update if I have any issues in the future (if that's a possible function here on amazon)
206	neg	Brand new out of the box, and the cursor when browsing, and my view when playing games jumps randomly around every 30secs or so
206	neg	It's extremely frustrating to say the least
206	neg	I contacted Logitech and I was told to clean the mouse, (again it's brand new), and if that didn't work to change a setting in the driver software
206	neg	Except the setting is from a much older version so can't do that either
206	neg	It's been 2 weeks and I already hate this thing
206	neg	Trying to do anything when your mouse flicks across the screen because you're trying to use it, is beyond annoying
206	neg	I'm not the only one either
206	neg	there's a lot of others complaining as well if you search it
207	pos	UpdateLogitech issues an RMA and I'll see how this one does
207	pos	At least it's supported
207	pos	_-------_The moose was great while it worked, it pairs well with Logitech keyboards and the color is consistent because why not have LEDs everywhere
207	pos	But somewhere in the added complexity of including stuff like that reduces the shelf life
207	pos	I've never actually had a moose "go bad" until now aside from the plastic wearing down or the coating on the outside beginning to peel
207	pos	This mouse seems to be lost as a mouse and I have to unplug and plug it in several times before it is recognised (the problem persists across a sea of ports and computers)It felt like a mouse and it moused very well while it functioned, but losing the connection in the middle of work is annoying
207	pos	Losing the connection during a game session is disheartening
208	neg	Right mouse button started to fail after about a year
208	neg	I'm not a heavy gamer
208	neg	Probably clock 10 hours a month at most
208	neg	I mostly use it for computer graphics work so it was incredibly frustrating when the mouse would basically unclick in the middle of a drag and drop or resizing of a window
208	neg	I was able to remap right click to another button, but for what I paid for it this is incredibly annoying
209	neg	First one was great till it had a double click issue, I assumed it was just me being unlucky and got a second one because it felt great
209	neg	And 1 year into it's life span it gets the double click issue again
209	neg	Updating drivers doesn't work
209	neg	Cleaning the mouse with condensed air works for a day and it double clicks again
209	neg	Just poor quality in whatever they put into the clicker
209	neg	I'll probably put my money elsewhere since logitech pretty much burned me
209	neg	Clarification on the double click issue, pressing the right side for me will double click every time you press it
209	neg	Sometimes sticking so you cannot drag any windows anymore
210	pos	Just got this yesterday so only had a small time to use it but must say its really great
210	pos	There are some good and some bad which I will get into in a moment
210	pos	When I got it my first impressions where "wow this box is small" so was a bit weirded out by it thinking I either got a wrong version of it or maybe it was going to be a tiny mouse but it was the actually correct size for my hand
210	pos	First time having it in my hand it felt right at home
210	pos	Even better the clicking is more accurate in games with minimal effort in comparison to my old mouse which was Corsair M65 Pro
210	pos	The scroll wheel broke on the M65 so was tied between M65 Elite or this and it got me thinking "well if the original M65 has scroll wheel issue the Elite might do the same" so with all the praise I decided to get this over the M65 Elite
210	pos	So glad I did
210	pos	Now onto pros and cons
210	pos	PRO:ComfortableEasy to use1 by 1 DPI in softwareMany buttons/button placements
210	pos	CONS:Mistakenly hitting the sniper button
210	pos	It takes little to no effort to activate it, so when I'm clicking left my thumb naturally hits it due to placement
210	pos	It's very impressive that the mistaken clicks are my only complaint right now
210	pos	Of course ill update this if anything else occurs
210	pos	I would recommend this product
210	pos	UPDATE 4/30/19: Had it for a few months i think but now it's causing an issue
210	pos	Random double clicks when i try to hold down and drag something on my screen, noticed it when i was playing a game, caused my character to drop it on the ground instead of move it
210	pos	Seems this is a big issue going on with ANY G502 models
210	pos	Found an article saying "disable Vsync and should fix it" did that and nope did not, even tho that was voted best solution on the official logitech site in 2016
210	pos	Something to be cautious about
211	pos	Update: I couldn't return the item because shipping internationally is very expensive, so Amazon sent a $30 refund and I could keep the mouse
211	pos	First, the box was damaged a bit (As shown in picture) but that's okay, when I opened it up the mouse was dusty and dirty, it clearly had been used and refurbished (The box was sealed)
211	pos	There were smudges and scratches beneath the mouse
211	pos	The mouse looks sick and all, but it's actually not comfortable at all
211	pos	After using it for an hour, the feeling of discomfort is ON
211	pos	The worst part of this mouse is customization, the software (Logitech G hub) doesn't let you customize the buttons, after a research on google, there's an older software (Logitech Gaming software) which does customize the buttons, but it's pain in the back, it took me an hour to figure out how this software works
211	pos	The scroll wheel is so stiff
211	pos	And that (Hyper scroll wheel) feature is cool but it's actually useless in games
211	pos	Overall I'm not happy with this mouse for its price, I have better choices for even cheaper prices
211	pos	I'm returning it and I advice everyone NOT to fall for it just cuz it has cool features that you won't actually use
212	pos	Got this mouse because of a recommendation from a friend
212	pos	He uses it for everything from MMOs to FPS games
212	pos	The mouse feels great in the hand and all of the programable buttons are easy to reach
212	pos	It also has additional weights to get your desired amount of drag resistance
212	pos	The build quality seems pretty good
212	pos	The scroll wheel is solid, the cable is braided, and the buttons all have a good feel to them
212	pos	The Logitech software is very good for setting up macros, mapping buttons, changing RGB settings, etc
212	pos	Overall it seems like a great mouse for the price
213	pos	First off, I love how it manages to have little weights that I didn't think I needed
213	pos	I keep mine heavy for better mouse control
213	pos	Plus, it's an excellent workout for your hand and arm movement
213	pos	And it's comfortable too when holding it
213	pos	The mouse response is good, plus the side buttons are an excellent feature
213	pos	Having those shortcuts on the mouse is perfect if your extended fingers on your other hand can't press a specific button on the keyboard
213	pos	Minor issues to keep in mind, it has a lot of open edges/corners that can collect dust and dead skin cells
213	pos	So be sure to clean it when not in use
213	pos	Steep price aside, I'd say it's a near-perfect mouse for your gaming and content creation needs
214	neg	There are 2 main reasons for negative reviews on this mouse
214	neg	1
214	neg	the hardware sucks, and brakes 2
214	neg	the software to use this for gaming sucks
214	neg	I actually got used to the G Hub software
214	neg	A lot of complaints around this but I have no issues with it
214	neg	I took a chance on this mouse and yep, the hardware broke in short order
214	neg	I am so surprised
214	neg	I have the MX anywhere 2 and MX anywhere 3 and they are solid and I stuff them haphazardly in bags for transport all the time
214	neg	This mouse has just been on my desk with light use and already has issues
215	neg	I bought this mouse in summer 2019, giving Logitech one last go after having at the time just lost yet another Logitech mouse to the double-click issue
215	neg	I thought maybe a $50 mouse would be made of some tougher stuff, but it began double-clicking occasionally after only 6 months
215	neg	A year later, it has gotten to the point that I am looking for a replacement
215	neg	I am also having issues with the scroll wheel failing to register when I attempt to scroll up, a problem I've never had with any other mouse before
215	neg	For those not in the know, the issue I'm talking about causes the mouse to register multiple clicks from one tap of the left mouse button, causing double-clicks when you intend to do single clicks, and randomly registering additional clicks while attempting to click and drag
215	neg	It doesn't happen on every click, but as the mouse ages, it happens more and more until it is eventually unusable
215	neg	This is caused by Logitech using cheap switches that break quickly, and despite years of people complaining about this, they have not done anything about it, I guess because it's a net win for them as long as the warranty has expired before the problem starts
215	neg	At this point I am convinced that the only way to avoid this problem is to find another brand for my next mouse
215	neg	That said, I gave this 2 stars because it was great for those first 6 months
215	neg	It would probably be a solid purchase for someone who feels confident enough to take the mouse apart and solder in higher quality switches, but that's not me, and I imagine, not most consumers
215	neg	Otherwise, maybe find a brand that is less shameless about their planned obsolescence
216	pos	This is my 3rd G502
216	pos	I had one at home for the longest time, then saw a good deal on the special edition model and grabbed another; at which time I took my older G502 to my work office
216	pos	Unfortunately the Special Edition started having sustained click & drag problems, making it difficult drag & drop or highlight items after around a year of use
216	pos	I have since then tossed that one away and replaced my home Mouse with another standard G502
216	pos	Both of my standard G502s have worked perfectly for me
216	pos	The ergonomics are great, the button features are pleasant without being over riddled
216	pos	I just consider this mouse to be perfect for me
217	pos	I've used and preferred Logitech mice off an on for over 30 years and at one time I liked the feel of the Microsoft Explorer mouse, but the Microsoft mice would die in under <3 years regularly, so I'm back to Logitech, but the wheel on my last G502 went afoul in under 3 years too - here's to hoping this one last longer so I don't have to start trying other brands again
217	pos	Yes, I do recommend Logitech products in general because they've been doing it right longer than most of the rest, but beware they aren't quite is sturdy as they once were
218	pos	I have been using mice since Windows 95
218	pos	This mouse comes with added weights as many do
218	pos	Not so sure I'll use them, time will tell
218	pos	As it is this mouse is very heavy which I like a lot
218	pos	More programable buttons than my last 3 button mouse
218	pos	That will be well used in World of Warcraft and Grounded the Game
218	pos	This manufacturer has a very good rep especially with me
218	pos	Quality
218	pos	I just got it today and it is: Be A Utiful
218	pos	Any problems and I'll update
218	pos	Rubber with bumpy grips on left and right, helps hold the hand in place
218	pos	The cord is fabric lined so it doesn't have a "memory" of staying in a position it shouldn't
218	pos	Not as wide as an M1Abrams and not as thin as T****'* ego
218	pos	I love it so far
219	pos	I've used other brands, but I've always ended up using Logitech ended up going back to Logitech
219	pos	This particular model has been one of my favorites and I use it on my main gaming desktop as well as my work laptop
219	pos	It has enough buttons to make it flexible without having so many as to make it overly complicated, especially for fingers that are not in the small glove category
219	pos	Price point calls for watching for sales, but quality, as advertised, delivery time, longevity of use, and ease of use make this one a winner
219	pos	I've used this model for several years and am completely satisfied
220	pos	The mouse itself is great, from a hardware standpoint
220	pos	Fastest sensor, max of 25k dpi, reliable switches, what's not to like
220	pos	Well, the design
220	pos	There are 2 buttons right next to the left mouse button, the most used button on a mouse, the 2 buttons adjust the dpi (sensitivity) of the mouse
220	pos	Because they are literally right next to the left mouse button, it is super easy to accidentally press on it
220	pos	I had to remove all other profiles from G Hub (Logitech Software), so that the 2 buttons are virtually disabled
220	pos	Or I guess you can also functionally disable them in G Hub
220	pos	Anyway, the rest of the mouse's design are alright, just takes some getting used to if you came from a Razer, whose mouses tend to be quite simplistic (except Naga)
221	pos	First of all, this is a really comfortable mouse to use
221	pos	I can't say enough good things about it - for the first 5 months
221	pos	At that point - almost as if there was a timer in it, the left mouse button becomes intermittent
221	pos	Especially for a gamer, this is critical
221	pos	You are at an extreme disadvantage when the trigger fails 50% of the time - until a few days later it is completely gone
221	pos	I do play a lot, I'll admit
221	pos	This is my fifth one, now
221	pos	I'm finally thinking of switching
221	pos	But it is so comfortable
221	pos	If only I didn't have to keep a backup
222	pos	I purchased this mouse in April 2020 to go along with the PC I'd just built to game my way through the pandemic
222	pos	For at least a year it was the greatest mouse I'd ever used, very easy to hold, customizable weights, lightweight accompanying Logitech software, the mouse looks great
222	pos	BUTBut then, I started having an issue that, though it may seem small, makes the mouse unusable in certain situations: My right mouse button developed a stutter
222	pos	Holding the RMB down will intermittently register multiple clicks
222	pos	It's absolutely unbearable for any FPS game where pressing right click scopes you in, and releasing right click scopes you out
222	pos	The result is that often, right click either doesn't scope me in at all, or it chaotically flies in and out of scope to terrible effect
222	pos	I like the mouse so much that I'm to give it another chance
222	pos	I know that there are others who have reported similar clicking issues, so it must be a manufacturing problem
222	pos	I will be purchasing my second-chance mouse along with a 4-year protection plan so I can replace it worry free
222	pos	If the second-chance mouse is problem free, I'll come back and give this mouse a 4-star review, because it really is a great mouse
223	neg	I absolutely love this mouse as a device
223	neg	The buttons are great, it feels good in the hand, it's very responsive
223	neg	What drives me insane is how awful the "GHub" software is
223	neg	It periodically updates and then randomly my mouse stops working until I spend 10-15 minutes fighting with the software to not default to a different profile or update firmware for a feature I don't need
223	neg	Today was my all time favorite -- a firmware update screen that said "do not unplug the mouse
223	neg	" After waiting an hour for something to happen, a quick Google search revealed that to do the upgrade YOU NEED TO UNPLUG THE MOUSE AND PLUG IT BACK IN
223	neg	Imagine writing a piece of software that says specifically not to do the one thing that fixes it
223	neg	Awesome
223	neg	As gravy for what a piece of junk this software is, I also have a Logitech G710+ keyboard that GHub doesn't even recognize
223	neg	I have to separately install and run the Logitech Gaming Software program
223	neg	This annoyed me for awhile but I've ultimately come to the conclusion that it's a good thing because Logitech has stopped touching that program, so it doesn't randomly break my stuff every month or two
224	pos	I use to have a G902 or 901
224	pos	I can't remember
224	pos	I had it for a couple of years before the bluetooth or whatever wireless technology it was using started to go on the fritz
224	pos	There were multiple solutions that led to multiple dead ends
224	pos	I was devastated because it was an amazing mouse
224	pos	It turns out, the problem was very common, and I was lucky enough to have it for as long as I did
224	pos	I ended up leaving a bad review on Amazon, and bad taste with Logitech problems in general
224	pos	I ended up buying a lot of cheap mouses (mice
224	pos	), but there was always something that couldn't compare to the 902
224	pos	After several cheap mice, I decided that if I'm going to spend this much might as well go for something like this
224	pos	I'm not disappointed in the slightest
224	pos	I love this mouse
224	pos	My girlfriend, who is a recent PC gamer convert, loves this mouse
224	pos	There is a wireless version of this, but I'm staying away from that until I absolutely think going wireless is something I need to do
224	pos	This mouse feels comfortable
224	pos	The customizable weights is a great idea
224	pos	The customizable buttons are also great, too
225	neg	Bought this a little over a year ago, started having issues with my left click button clicking multiple times with one click- very annoying and makes it impossible to use
225	neg	I found a macro online that fixed it for a little while, but it started doing it again
225	neg	Basically, Logitech uses cheap & poorly designed switches that wear out easily
225	neg	It's otherwise a great mouse, but it just wears out quick
225	neg	Lots of information online about this issue
225	neg	It does have a "3 year limited warranty", but it has been next to impossible to get support, it's very hard to actually open a ticket to start an RMA, and it sends you in circles on the website when you have this issue
226	pos	11 programmable buttons
226	pos	Most of them have great response time, click well, and aren't mushy at all
226	pos	A good amount of care went into this mouse
226	pos	DPI can be adjusted on-the-fly or if you're like me, those buttons can be used for other purposes like macros, in-game actions, etc
226	pos	The good: 9 high-quality programmable buttons, and the scroll wheel
226	pos	The scroll wheel can be toggled from having a "bumpy" mode to free-spinning using a mechanical button (can't be programmed cause it functions mechanically)
226	pos	Lights up
226	pos	Weight can be changed
226	pos	Profiles can be made for different games and applications
226	pos	DPI display (3 bars of light) allow easy checking of DPI
226	pos	Mouse can be tuned any way you want
226	pos	The bad: G-Hub sucks, but is necessary for most of the mouse's functions
226	pos	Scroll wheel tilt functions are a little more mushy, and it's hard to tell when they're activated
226	pos	Mouse looks "gamer" which may or may not be a positive for you
226	pos	The triangle patterns on both side of the mouse pick up dirt
226	pos	Pretty good mouse
227	neg	Don't waste your time or money
227	neg	After a couple of months of use, this mouse wouldn't function properly, the pointer is jittery and won't hold among other things
227	neg	So, I  called amazon and they first said they were going to replace it via the extra warranty I purchased, which I thought was ridiculous because it was a defective piece of merchandise
227	neg	I waited but it never came
227	neg	I called back again, this time Amazon said it should not have been a replacement through my Asurion policy, and said they would send me a replacement right away
227	neg	I received the replacement, and after a month-not during the time of the 1st or 2nd call to them did they say I would need to return the old mouse
227	neg	A month or so later, I get a email saying I needed to return the old mouse or they will charge me for the 2nd mouse, but don't send me a return label
227	neg	Then they send me an email saying to drop it off at a Kohls store-no box needed
227	neg	I am a handicapped person that lives on the 2nd floor in the apartment complex
227	neg	I do not have transportation and do not go out
227	neg	That's why I have Amazon Prime - for the delivery feature
227	neg	They just charged me $57 for the 2nd mouse and guess what
227	neg	The 2nd mouse is doing the same malfunctions as the first
227	neg	Needless to say, I won't buy this brand again and Amazon has definitely FAILED in its service through this whole process
227	neg	I purchase weekly through Amazon and don't believe that I or anyone else should be treated this way
227	neg	Now, I have to make a third time-consuming call that will aggravate me and make me ill
227	neg	AMAZON, IF YOU'RE READING THIS-AS YOU SHOULD BE-SEND ME A RETURN SLIP AND I WILL SEND BOTH OF THE DEFECTIVE MOUSES BACK
227	neg	And of course, you should refund me for both defective products
228	neg	The media could not be loaded
228	neg	Getting the mouse replaced under warranty, but not holding out hope, as this seems a common problem that gets worse with each mouse over time
228	neg	You can have this problem with either the left or right buttons, or both
228	neg	It will be noticeable when you get false double-clicks (i
228	neg	e
228	neg	when you meant to single click)
228	neg	In my case, had the problem from day 1, but initially thought I was accidentally double clicking & needed to get used to the mouse's button sensitivity
228	neg	But it got worse over time until it was clearly an issue with the mouse
228	neg	Logitech support first had me install their "G Hub" software and update the firmware of the mouse
228	neg	This seemed to correct the problem, but only for a couple weeks
228	neg	This does seem to be something that gradually deteriorates in the switch mechanism of the buttons, and a software fix can only do so much
228	neg	There is a website that can detect the fast/false clicks
228	neg	Logitech warranty support will want a video of you using this website that detects the false/fast clicks
228	neg	See video I've attached, but note they will want a handheld video where you show the physical mouse in your hand and the website on screen, no edits, etc
228	neg	(this is fair--they do have to protect themselves from fraudulent warranty claims)
228	neg	Google "fast double click test" to find the website
228	neg	The problem tends to come and go, and the likelihood of getting a fast/false click may depend on exactly how you are holding the mouse at that moment, which changes as you slide the mouse around or just shift your sitting position
228	neg	For the video here I happened to find a hand position where it was happening most of the time, and carefully kept my hand in that position and pressed the button the same way each time
228	neg	More often I get around 10 bad clicks out of 100
228	neg	Sometimes I get zero out of 100
228	neg	I'll update this review after some time with the replacement
229	pos	I have probably owned 15 or 20 different mice in my life and this one is definetely my favorite
229	pos	I had been using a performance MX but wanted to step up to something with programmable buttons
229	pos	I ordered a G602 (wireless) and I really liked the button layout on that one but I hated the fact that the DPI only went up to 2500 and it also seemed to cut out from time to time
229	pos	So I decided to order the G502 and give it a try
229	pos	What a difference
229	pos	I have slightly large hands, and even though this mouse has a slightly smaller footprint than the g602 it still fits my hand better
229	pos	I mean it REALLY feels great in my hand
229	pos	I tried it out with the extra weights, but I find that I actually prefer it without them
229	pos	Bottom line is this is definitely my favorite mouse I have ever owned by a long shot
229	pos	Well worth the $80
229	pos	Well done logitech
229	pos	I also love the logitech gaming software and the ability to adjust your DPI profile settings and such
230	pos	I had logitech mice for decades and I want to tell you that quality of Logitech is degrading over the years :( Sad but true
230	pos	The best wuality mouse from Logitech I had was mighty old MX300
230	pos	If you saw a circuit board itself you would be amased, it is still alive after ages of wuake 3 and counterstrike battles
230	pos	My mouse before this one was G500, good wuality compared to this G502, but not for ky style of play and holding the mouse, but quality much higher then of G502
230	pos	Now lets talk about G502, plastic is much cheaper feeling compared to G500, and regarding scrollwheel it is Awful
230	pos	First of all it grinds like a grinder and it has so much rattle when playing that I was forced to change the scroll wheel, transplanted it from G500
230	pos	G500s scroll wheel is perfect quality
230	pos	We will see how it copes with my play, but I am afraid it wont last forever like my trusty old MX300
231	pos	This mouse feels great
231	pos	The two buttons on the left side are a little too low
231	pos	They need to be slightly higher up so you don't accidentally click them
231	pos	My biggest complaint is the scroll wheel is free flowing
231	pos	It spins too easily and there's no click sensation
231	pos	Meaning when you're playing a game and you need to use the scroll wheel, for switch weapons for example, you're not going to have a good time
231	pos	It's next to useless, so I'll be returning this mouse
231	pos	If you never need to use the scroll wheel at all, this is a great mouse otherwise
232	neg	Update: After uninstalling G Hub and reinstalling LGS the mouse is now recognized in LGS
232	neg	While I have read elsewhere that it is not supported on LGS, it is working so I've added another star
232	neg	So far the mouse itself is good, the software situation is still a mess
232	neg	---If you used Logitech Gaming Software before, expect to start all customization from scratch for all your logitech devices
232	neg	Logitech Gaming Software (LGS) does not recognize this mouse
232	neg	It requires different software (G Hub) which also requires uninstalling LGS
232	neg	With G Hub, the company trashed working and mature software (LGS) in favor of non-functional or barely functional beta software
232	neg	After figuring out how to fix the infinite loading loop, you will still have to start over remaking all customizations and macros for all software
232	neg	There is no working capability to import LGS profiles to GHUB and no option to do this manually due to core design format changes
233	neg	I purchased it on April 2020
233	neg	I play wow and need to hold the right click to turn the camera view
233	neg	And this mouse failed me 5 days ago
233	neg	The right click can still work, but when you hold it
233	neg	it will drop the signal suddenly
233	neg	Usually those gaming mouse can hold around 3-4 years in my past experience
233	neg	Failed within half year is a totally new experience for me
233	neg	Beside this problem, it is a comfortable mouse
233	neg	However, it failed to deliver the basic mouse function
233	neg	I can only give it one star
233	neg	I will try to contact the customer service and will go back to update this post after
234	neg	The left click on this startes getting flaky about 6months after purchase
234	neg	It would randomly drop the click, so click-and-holds were frustrating
234	neg	Issue would come and go, but now it is unusable 15 months after purchase
234	neg	I've noticed the issue is related to click force
234	neg	A full force press causes the drop, while a minimal force seems to work fine
234	neg	My finger just isnt that calibrated
234	neg	Web searches report this issue is a design flaw in the switch
234	neg	Shame; i liked the rest of the mouse and always been a Logitech fan
235	pos	The updated software for the G502 Hero is Clunky, it also renders the "Logitech gaming Software" for older versions of the mouse useless
235	pos	The mouse randomly speeds up and slows down for no reason especially at first since they removed surface tuning in the hero [both core/spectrum had surface tuning options]I've gone back to my worn down G502 Proteus Core, it still gets the job done but after 8 years, probably will just buy another Proteus core instead
235	pos	Very disappointed, will be buying up discontinued proteus core/Spectrum Models
236	pos	Pros:- Easy to map new bindings to each button with the software available
236	pos	- Good solid feel to the mouse overall and about the same size as the razer 2013 deathadder (meaning it's decent for larger hands)
236	pos	- There are included weoghts allowing for adjustment based on personal preference
236	pos	I find certain mice to be too light, so the option for additional weight is personally greatly appreciated
236	pos	Cons:- You are required to download the software for this mouse manually and it isn't the easiest interface I have ever used
236	pos	Without previous software experience (mine being from razer synapse), it might be a challenge for inexperienced users
236	pos	- While I appreciate the mouse wheels ability to unlock completely, I waish there was a adjustment for the sensitivity of the mousewheel akin to that of the razer basilisk
236	pos	I use the mouse wheel for many things in gaming and it's a little janky at times
236	pos	- I know some people really like RGB style customization and this mouse is sub-par in those regards
236	pos	You have the options for quite a few colors, but you only ever see it on the logo about the size of your thumbnail and on the dpi setting adjustment lights
236	pos	Overall a very small area of the mouse that only reallys seems to be there for finding it in a poorly lit environment
236	pos	All in all:This mouse is a great choice for the most seasoned veterans of gaming and the new-comers alike
236	pos	It might not be a great fit for those with small hands, but it provides enoigh versatility to be viable in almost any genre of game (competitive or not)
237	pos	I use to shop for relatively inexpensive mice
237	pos	The most I would spend was around $25
237	pos	This mouse is faster and more responsive than my previous one, which was the Gamdias Ourea mouse
237	pos	The drivers were lacking and the software was unstable on my Amd x570 crosshair hero VIII Wifi motherboard
237	pos	Sometimes the mouse would stop being recognized in my windows 10 pro 64bit 20H2 system
237	pos	Every so often I would have to unplug and replug it back in
237	pos	I have not experienced that issue with this mouse {not even once so far}
237	pos	Software and drivers work perfectly and the support is excellent
237	pos	Highly recommend this mouse for all your gaming needs
238	pos	Got it to replace my MX518 that died
238	pos	I thought about getting another one but figured after using a MX510 MX512 MX518 since 1999 I would try something else
238	pos	This feels a lot like the MX5x series, but more refined
238	pos	Also has more buttons
238	pos	The software is intiutive and doesn't feel bloated
238	pos	Has everything you need to control RGB, DPI and other settings
238	pos	Glides effortlessly on the mousepad
238	pos	I love the option of customizeable weights
238	pos	Highly recommend for this price range
239	neg	This is a great mouse
239	neg	Very responsive and comfortable
239	neg	But expect to have to buy a new one every year because the switches for the left and right click wear out and start double clicking shortly after a year of normal use
239	neg	Mine actually started having issues before the warranty ran out, but Logitech doesn't make it easy to file a warranty claim
239	neg	Eventually got to file a claim which they make you verify the issue by clicking on a box on a site they host
239	neg	Issue is, you can only click a certain number of times before it's deemed defective or not
239	neg	Mine was having an issue, but not reliably enough to be caught by their check so I wasn't able to exchange the mouse
239	neg	The problem kept getting worse and worse and now that the mouse is out of warranty it's very frustrating to use and there's nothing I can do about it
240	neg	I am extremely disappointed with this mouse
240	neg	If you had asked me just one month ago what I thought of it, I'd say "Great
240	neg	"  It worked beautifully, it was very comfortable, and I liked all of the easy to access buttons on the side of the mouse
240	neg	Earlier this month, I started to notice that the right mouse button wasn't detecting when I clicked
240	neg	It seemed to do this randomly, and I'm still not certain if it makes a difference where I press down on the button
240	neg	It seemed like if I kept my finger dead center, it was a little more consistent
240	neg	Now even that doesn't work
240	neg	The only thing that seems to reliably get it to detect the click is pressing down VERY hard whenever I right click
240	neg	In addition, starting yesterday I ran into the same issue others have described where it double-right clicks with only a single click of the button
240	neg	It's getting to the point where a number of games are becoming almost unplayable, so I have to replace the thing
240	neg	Words cannot begin to express my disappointment
240	neg	I bought some cheap 20$ mouse with less than 4 stars in review and it was one of my favorite gaming mice of all time, lasted me at least a couple of years
240	neg	This mouse was more expensive and lasted a measly six months, if that
240	neg	To add insult to injury, I didn't buy the extended protection plan, and the time to replace it has run out
240	neg	So it looks like I'm stuck with it
240	neg	It is possible that what I've experienced is a freak incident
240	neg	It's possible that this was a "One in a million" scenario
240	neg	Maybe no one else will run into this, maybe I wouldn't run into it again if I bought a new one
240	neg	But it doesn't really matter, because in this case I'm the one
240	neg	I do not intend to buy this mouse ever again
241	pos	I've heard some people have had quality control issues, so I was worried when I bought it, but my mouse has been nothing short of stellar
241	pos	No double clicking, very "hefty" feeling (not heavy as in "I can't move the mouse quickly", but heavy as in "that feels sturdy and of good quality"), feels great to hold in my hand
241	pos	You can also add or remove weights from the mouse to control how light you want it to be, which I think is really cool
241	pos	I haven't programmed many of the buttons yet (I guess I'm lazy), but it does have the option for those shortcuts to be customized
241	pos	If you're hesitant, I would definitely recommend this mouse
241	pos	If you happen to be one of the people who gets a defective product like some others in these reviews (which, isn't there almost always that risk on Amazon
241	pos	), I'm sure you could get a replacement or a refund
242	neg	My friend and I both have the same mouse
242	neg	He is on his second mouse and told me that it is the worst mouse to buy since left click has a defect
242	neg	I am on my third mouse and confirmed with him that my third mouse has a defect on left click as well
242	neg	I continued to buy this mouse because I am used to it however I have finally found a suitable mouse to buy
242	neg	I will never buy another logitech mouse again
242	neg	DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES OR ANY PC EDITING
242	neg	This mouse will double click with a single click or when clicking and holding/dragging items it will not register or let the item go
242	neg	YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
243	neg	First off, this is a great mouse when it works properly
243	neg	Unfortunately when I lift off the pad to reposition during gaming it sometimes loses tracking for a moment and launches my view all over the place until it reestablishes tracking
243	neg	I've searched for solutions and it seems to be an somewhat common issue with the Hero sensor
243	neg	I've tried all recommendations including new mouse pads but it will still randomly do it
243	neg	My old Logitech Mx518 never had this problem
243	neg	Some people mentioned using the calibration feature in the Logitech software but this feature has been removed from Hero sensor equipped mice
243	neg	This tracking issue is a deal breaker for me and I've switched back to my old MX518 for now
243	neg	Could be an isolated issue
243	neg	As for ergonomics, I would love to meet the person who decided to put the 2 dpi selector switches right next to the left click button
243	neg	It's way too easy to accidentally hit these during gaming and I ended up having to unbind these in the Logitech app
243	neg	Luckily it also has the side buttons for thumb access that I was able to remind those to
243	neg	Gaming mice need a large left click button to accommodate different grip styles
243	neg	not sure how they screwed that up
243	neg	All in all
243	neg	I wouldn't buy it, the new hero sensors dont live up to the hype and were going backwards in ergonomics
244	neg	The right click on this mouse stopped functioning properly within 8 months
244	neg	It doesn't hold a click, which makes any game using the RMB basically unplayable
244	neg	I contacted customer support (the website is terrible)
244	neg	After two weeks of back and forth, providing a video of the problem, providing a picture with my ticket and serial, I get a message saying it's out of stock and to wait another 3 weeks
244	neg	So guess I need to buy another mouse since I've already waited longer than I would like
244	neg	And who knows when they will actually get around to it
244	neg	Definitely aint gonna buy another logitech mouse though, that's for sure
245	pos	This is my second g502, the first was the original
245	pos	This one is even better with the ability to change the color and the new cable
245	pos	First one lasted a few years of intense use
245	pos	It actually still works but middle button on the wheel started getting eratic and it was about time for a new one
245	pos	That one will be put to use on a spare system for casual use
245	pos	Won't be using that button much on that one
245	pos	I've used quite a few different mice over the years, most I can't even remember
245	pos	My favorite is between this and the original r
245	pos	a
245	pos	t
245	pos	9 I really liked the adjustability of that one, but wasn't sure about the new company making it quite yet
245	pos	With the thinner, lighter cable on the hero and the ability to change the lighting, it's near perfect for me
246	neg	I don't often play click heavy games like shooters
246	neg	I mostly play RPG's, Strategy games, or I use my controller, and I regularly using this mouse for general computing
246	neg	However, I am frustrated that after a little over a year, this mouse developed the same left click issues my last one (Logitech Wired Pro which also lasted a little over a year) did
246	neg	Whenever I perform a single left click, it often clicks twice and when I hold the left mouse button to drag (like you do all the time in a strategy game or moving files around) it will regularly disengage as if I lifted my finger, even though I am not changing pressure
246	neg	Nearly every time I single clicked a space in this text box, while writing this review, I selected the word next to the space like I double clicked or the entire paragraph like I triple clicked
246	neg	Compounding this issue is my long standing loyalty to this company
246	neg	I have a Logitech G213 Keyboard, a G935 headset with all the LED's synced, and I have a set of Logitech speakers on my desk that are 15 years old that sound great and still rumble the windows when the bass hits
246	neg	Even though the last mouse failed, I still bought another, thinking this time would be different
246	neg	I've been using Logitec products and recommended them to others for years (I work in IT), so It doesn't make me happy that these mice keep failing on me from the company that I love
246	neg	Seeing as other people are having these issues, I'm never wanting to get another one of these gaming mice again
246	neg	Might have to start transitioning all my gear to another company soon too
246	neg	Sad day
246	neg	P
246	neg	S
246	neg	I switched to an 8 year old Dell mouse I had lying around so I could finish writing and editing this review
246	neg	Zero issues
246	neg	Hopefully I can get this repaired via warranty
246	neg	I will update this review with how that goes
247	neg	Incredible hardware, but the software is f***ing s***
247	neg	It has an infamous problem where it gets stuck in an infinite loading screen after a fresh install or update
247	neg	There are countless Reddit threads that all detail the same problems and there are so many solutions that it could take days to figure out which one works for you on your computer
247	neg	I love the mouse and it's design, but when I can't change the color settings due to s*** software I do not give a single F*** about your product
247	neg	Take it from someone who has had this mouse since February, the software is deal breaking and Logitech can honestly go f*** itself since there are threads with this problem since 2018 and they haven't fixed it
247	neg	Go buy one of there many competitors and I'm sure you'll like it a lot more
247	neg	I plan to buy one soon but it hurts that I wasted $50
248	neg	My Razer mouse broke so I bought this mouse as it was within my low budget and would fit my large hand
248	neg	The reviews were also really good so I thought it would work well and last a long time
248	neg	The mouse is heavy and feels very premium
248	neg	It works just fine without any programs or special drivers, but I recommend the GHUB program since you can customize the sensitivity more precisely
248	neg	I was a happy user until about 6 months in when the right click button started to not hold down
248	neg	This normally wasn't an issue, but during games where you hold right click to aim, it made them unplayable
248	neg	I got a replacement pretty quickly and didn't have any issues until about another 6 months later when it started having the same issue
248	neg	I submitted a request for another replacement (or just a refund) and it took them about a week to respond
248	neg	Ultimately, I just bought another Razer Deathadder (the V2 model this time), which is what I had before and is what worked fine for over 3 years
248	neg	While I believe the original G502 was of high-quality parts and should last for a long time, this new HERO model clearly has problems with the switches and I wouldn't recommend it due to its reliability issues
249	neg	Right-click does not hold consistently, frequently unpressing/pressing the button while you hold it down
249	neg	It gets a lot worse if you right-click and drag
249	neg	Unacceptable for any game that relies on this
249	neg	Both left and right click buttons will frequently double-click when you single-click
249	neg	Happens maybe 1 in 9-12 clicks that wind up double-clicking
249	neg	Awful for moments where double-click confirms, or when you mean to click+drag and it double-clicks instead
249	neg	Side buttons work most of the time, but occasionally don't register when you hear them click
249	neg	Pointer precision and response is good, it's ergonomic, wheel works (for me but I've read others having issues with it) - everything else with the mouse is fine
249	neg	But this is absolutely awful for gaming anything that requires left/right-click precision and consistency

250	pos	Este es el segundo Mouse G502 que tengo
250	pos	El primero lo compré inalámbrico, pero cuando llegó tenía cable
250	pos	Amazon me reembolsó la diferencia y me quedé con el mouse con cable
250	pos	El G502 con cable resultó tan bueno y el cable tan flexible y cómodo que no pensé más en comprar el inalámbricoDe hecho el segundo que he comprado tiene cable también y es excelente
250	pos	Los puntos principales que hacen este mouse especial es la rueda de desplazamiento, la cual es super cómoda, y rápida;  la iluminación y los colores
250	pos	Lo recomiendo
251	neg	Oh where do I begin
251	neg	I've had the proteus spectrum and logitech gaming software for years now
251	neg	Everything is working great
251	neg	GREAT MOUSE
251	neg	So naturally when I saw this one with the same form factor just "updated" I jumped on the lower price
251	neg	This mouse feels great in my hand and the weights are a great option to fit this thing just right
251	neg	****They recently moved away from LGS to some ghub TERRIBLE software
251	neg	Incredibly unintuitive and clunky to use
251	neg	***I want to map my modifier buttons (shift, alt, cntrl) to the side buttons where my thumb naturally falls, like I do with my proteus
251	neg	YOU CANT
251	neg	They will map on the software but they will not register on any application, not even a word document
251	neg	I called Logitech customer support and after being on a call for over an hour and a half with a guy that had a chicken cock-a-doodle-dooing every 15 seconds he had NOTHING to tell me
251	neg	So he escalated my call and said someone will call me back
251	neg	No call after 3 days
251	neg	Called back, pretty sure I got the same guy and he "emailed the escalation team and someone should get back to you shortly
251	neg	" It's been over a week now with no call back
251	neg	Worst customer service I've experienced in a long time
251	neg	The funny thing is, if you google this there are many, mannnny reports of this and even some logitech professionals that have worked on this same issue from a while ago
251	neg	Still no fix
251	neg	Save your money
251	neg	I'm returning
252	pos	This mouse is comfortable and precise
252	pos	The G glows too, and you can change the color
252	pos	My only complaint is the positioning of navigation buttons
252	pos	I accidentally click the back because it is located next to the thumb rest, but I'm pretty sure that can be disabled, and it is useful in some games
252	pos	Sometimes I bump the dpi setting buttons against the side of my keyboard if I run out of room, but that's on me for not allowing enough space
252	pos	Aside from that, it's everything I want in a mouse
252	pos	My favorite feature is the mouse wheel is unlockable
252	pos	You've got your normal clicky mouse wheel scrolling, but you can unlock it to make the wheel free-spinning
252	pos	This is extremely useful in any game with a semi-auto weapon and a high fire rate (faster than you can normally click)
252	pos	You can use mouse wheel down as an alternative input to fire weapon, and it turns into a Gatling gun
252	pos	Good times
253	pos	I wasn't sure i would like this mouse
253	pos	it looks kinda like a space ship so was worried a bit
253	pos	I had a corsair glave for years and really liked it and was worried that this smaller mouse would be hard for me to get used to
253	pos	after about 4 hours I started to get used to and love the mouse
253	pos	As i continue to use it i have only found one issue I often find the scroll wheel when unlocked zoom in a out in games (some games do different things just took one for example) so I only unlock it to scroll down where i lock it again
253	pos	really like the mouse wish I had gotten the wireless version honestly
254	neg	The G502 feels great in my hand
254	neg	The software isn't anything special, but it works fine
254	neg	I've bought Logitech mice for about 2 decades now and they've always done well for me until now
254	neg	This mouse has a design flaw
254	neg	You can see it in lots of other reviews here and I want to add my story to the list
254	neg	I'm on my second mouse
254	neg	Both were bought new
254	neg	The first I bought from Amazon, the second from Target
254	neg	The first mouse survived 6 months
254	neg	The second survived 4
254	neg	For me the failure mode has been if I hold down the left mouse button, it can randomly register multiple clicks while the button is held down
254	neg	If you're trying to highlight text that means killing your selection and starting a new one
254	neg	If you're moving a file it means dropping the file wherever happens to be when it decides you're not still holding the button, if you're playing a game, it can mean double spending on an attribute point or on a weapon that you hold to charge it can mean randomly shooting early
254	neg	This problem isn't limited to the left mouse button, I've seen it happen on the right button as well where it continually flipped me in and out of sniper mode in games
254	neg	It's a shame
254	neg	I really like the mouse when it works, but a $50 mouse should last longer than 5 months (the average for my 2 mice)
255	pos	Polybutene grip will melt eventually and get sticky
255	pos	Mouse raddles when I shake or tap it
255	pos	Sounds and looks cheap
255	pos	I would have returned it if it didnt have an unlockable scroll wheel and it was not on sale
255	pos	Its a $50 mouse wireless or not build quality wise
255	pos	Mouse tracks well but tends to reset its settings on reboot
255	pos	Logitech really wants is software running in the background
255	pos	Software functionality is OK but they want you to make an account to download comunity created profiles
255	pos	I will NOT
255	pos	Mouse wheel is highest quality part
255	pos	And stop putting nylon cables on things
255	pos	They get dirty and kink and frey
255	pos	They need to be literally be washed evetually
256	pos	i had a deathrzor chroma which felt off, then swapped over to the g402 and felt amazing
256	pos	and then again i swapped to the g502 (hero, although the difference is extremely small and you can barely tell) and it felt even better
256	pos	mouse is a bit heavy even with only 1 plate (im using none) and is on the slightly large size, but i have no problem griping it even with my medium-small sized hands
256	pos	software works great with it, and it feels a lot more responsive in games than other mice
256	pos	its also cool to have people look at it and get confused by the alien shape
256	pos	free scroll wheel is extremely satisfying and i find myself unlocking it every so often to play with it like a fidget spinner
256	pos	locked mode is quite solid
256	pos	the extra button is not as convenient due to its location, but i use it to cycle through various profiles instead
256	pos	definitely a 5/5
256	pos	the only downside i had with this mouse is that the top left 2 keys are a bit harder to reach as well as the one on the top, but i usually use them for the likes of music\volume controlls becasue the other 3 are more than enough
256	pos	in addition, pressing mb3 can be quite difficult with it moving to the sides all the time, but ive gotten into the habit of using left-tilt mb3 instead, and i find it a ton more comfortable to move it to the side instead of trying to press it
257	pos	Bought this mouse to replace my old Logitech laser mouse that has been with me through frag and fail
257	pos	It's going to take some time to getting used to the new mouse and sensitivity
257	pos	it's very sensitive
257	pos	It glides easier and is more responsive than my old mouse, which should be a good thing
257	pos	but I was used to the old guy and his failings
257	pos	The forward/back buttons on the side are situated a TAD bit different than my old mouse, but like I said, it's going to take some time
257	pos	I'm still grieving from the loss of such an solid soldier and hope this mouse can live up to it's namesake
258	pos	I have been using this mouse for FPS games such as Insurgency Sandstorm, Ground Branch, and Tarkov since Nov 2020
258	pos	I've been lucky so far with the mouse scroll wheel still working
258	pos	I use a mix between fingertip and palm grips
258	pos	The extra mouse buttons helps with secondary roles like switching optics and fire select modes
258	pos	Very comfortable mouse to use and the Logitech app is very easy to use and navigate
258	pos	Mouse clicks are light and with a positive tactile click
258	pos	I would recommend turning off mouse smoothing on both games and in mouse settings
259	pos	This is my second Logitech mouse, i try to stay with logitech because of software
259	pos	my logitech mouse left mouse pointer button slowly stopped registering input
259	pos	at first it was here and there then got worse and worse eventually i had to buy a new mouse
259	pos	Now i own the logitech hero 502 and after a little over a year it has begun doing the same thing
259	pos	I am very careful with my hardware, i still use a logitech G15 in 2020 which is i dont know how old at this point, well over 10 years
259	pos	but there seems to be a repeating issue with these Mice that isnt a cause of carelessness or neglect by user
259	pos	I hope logitech takes a look at the mouse mechanical button situation and improves on it
260	neg	This review if for the Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Gaming Mouse
260	neg	Purchased this mouse a year ago
260	neg	Mouse has a great build quality, works well, feels good in the hand and is very responsive
260	neg	The software is easy to use and navigate
260	neg	I really like the mouse but days after I purchased it, the right mouse button was intermittent and not consistent(I'm not hard on my hardware and treat it with care)
260	neg	I use the mouse for a variety of applications but for gaming and FPS type games, a intermittent right click is not good
260	neg	All the other buttons work well and I like the click and response  of the buttons and the mouse as a whole, but not having a right mouse button that is reliable isn't good
261	pos	I bought one for my gaming setup and a week later got one for my brother
261	pos	This is just a great mouse for gaming and productivity
261	pos	You can save different profiles to the mouse and switch between them depending on what you are doing
261	pos	I have a gaming profile for my most played game and one for work with quick shortcuts to enhance efficiency
261	pos	The hyperscroll wheel is a beast at helping get through long PDFs and Excel files at work
261	pos	Also being able to switch sensitivity on the fly comes in handy too
261	pos	This has been a great addition to both mine and my brother's pc setup
262	neg	Nice mouse all in all
262	neg	More buttons than I've found uses for yet, highly programmable
262	neg	Better fit than most mice for large hands, but a perfectly sized mouse would still be a bit longer
262	neg	Down side, when I add the included weights to it, the magnetic panel on the bottom can't close
262	neg	The weights seem to have permanent fingerprint smudges on them that I can't wipe off, haven't tried cleaning solution and likely won't since they don't fit in the mouse anyways
262	neg	8/10/20 Update: I bought this mouse because my last one was double-clicking all the time
262	neg	Just over 1 year after purchase, this mouse is doing the same thing
262	neg	I'm really disappointed in Logitech with this mouse
262	neg	Their wireless mice that come with a keyboard typically last 3-4 times longer in my experience
262	neg	I now have to clear my schedule for an evening to disassemble this mouse and hope I can bend the spring back into shape so it doesn't double click every time I try to click once
263	pos	I love this mouse
263	pos	I have used many gaming mice: mad catz RAT 6, razer ouroboros, and corsair dark core
263	pos	All have been great mice but needed to be replaced over time from use
263	pos	This mouse is really nice
263	pos	Feels great and works well
263	pos	Pros:- Free/ locked scroll wheel is nice- Fully customizable buttons ( in software )- Rgb is not obnoxious- separate weights to customize for your mouse- great price when on saleCons:- for large hands my pinky has no where to sit but to hit the mouse pad ( most of my other mice have had a curve or plate to place my pinky)- no detachable wire / not usb c
264	pos	I have had the G502 since it has been released and have really loved mine
264	pos	Still works amazingly after now many many years
264	pos	These mice provided you don't nerd rage too much are fit for great longevity
264	pos	However the first gen of the G502 certainly had some quirks, mostly no RGB and the sensor always felt just a little bit off
264	pos	Now with the newwer G502 Hero, they have made the G502 essentially flawless
264	pos	The new mouse is basically flawless
264	pos	No issues with the sensor, rgb, or anything
264	pos	The only flaw left is that some people may want a wireless version and they even sell that now
264	pos	I'd be surprised if anyone is on the edge with this mouse, it's entirely worth buying
265	pos	Own a bunch of Logitech mice with the free wheel spinning feature, the problem with the G502 is that free wheel is a little TOO free
265	pos	The free wheel feature on Logitech's other mice (M705, MX Anywhere 2/2S, MX Master 3) won't move on it's own or rattle as bad when you flick your mouse around (the wheel is going to rattle a little with any mouse that has the free wheel feature), on the G502 is particularly bad
265	pos	Sometimes when I scroll down, stop the wheel and start moving the mouse around it would scroll up or down on it's own
265	pos	The grip on the wheel is quite bad too compared to Logitech's other mice I've used that have a rubber track around the wheel for better grip
265	pos	Other than this one negative, it's a great mouse overall
266	pos	This mouse will randomly move the cursor on it's own, so in a game you may experience random spinning, looking up, and looking down
266	pos	Gets very frustrating too getting into a gun fight and having this mouse screw you over
266	pos	Also had my key binds not work at all
266	pos	Pretty small mouse and quite heavy for the size
266	pos	Also if you have larger hands, this may not be the mouse for you
266	pos	It seems well built, but seems to have software and sensor issues
266	pos	The button layout on the side is kind of bad, you will have to reach for the bigger button because the forward and back buttons are set back
266	pos	The larger button is a bit too tall
266	pos	Sometimes the scroll wheel lags, currently have it set to switch weapons and sometimes doesn't switch right away
266	pos	I own the Corsair Scimitar and it performs flawlessly
266	pos	Wanted this mouse because the forward and back buttons are bigger and also for the left and right scroll wheel buttons
267	pos	I've owned 4 gaming mice to date
267	pos	Coolermaster, Steelseries, Razer, and another Logitech (this one is still alive +8 years)
267	pos	So even though I'm not an expert because I know there are people who have owned or tested more gaming mice I have enough experience to know if a mouse is garbage or not
267	pos	Pros:- Buttons
267	pos	LOTS OF BUTTONS
267	pos	- I love Logitech's software, so much better than Steelseries in my opinion- This mouse is very precise and accurate- The click
267	pos	The click this mouse produces is so much better than other mice I've owned
267	pos	- Adjustable weight- This mouse is heavier than some of my other mice but somehow the weight is distributed better
267	pos	Cons:- The weight, yes, I know I stated it's weight is distributed very well
267	pos	However, the mouse could've been a 5 star for me if they could chomp a few grams off
267	pos	I highly recommend this mouse and to be honest any other mouse made by Logitech they're really good quality products and they're built to last
268	pos	This mouse was great, until it started having a left click problem
268	pos	Occasionally when using left click it sets off several rapid clicks at once, and would do the same when the mouse button is held
268	pos	No problem I thought, this has a 2 year warranty
268	pos	Except there is a problem
268	pos	Their support policies imply their customers are automatically dishonest and put a large burden on their customers to prove otherwise
268	pos	Aside from standard troubleshooting steps I was asked to go to a website to test the mouse clicker, no problem
268	pos	It was registering plenty of extra clicks
268	pos	Then I continued reading, and saw they wanted video evidence which met certain requirements:"Video needs to show the website on the screen and the mouse (physically and not just the cursor) together with a handwritten note of the ticket number at the same time
268	pos	"This blew my mind
268	pos	They wanted me to do this while recording it all with my phone
268	pos	So I express my dissatisfaction with this and note that not everyone even has the means to do this, took a screenshot of the website and attached it
268	pos	This convinced the agent to go ahead and replace the mouse anyway, but even so the additional demands are frustrating
268	pos	I am being asked to destroy the product and provide photo evidence before they send the replacement
268	pos	So I have a mouse that is frustrating to use but at least it is better than no mouse, and they want me to destroy it before they send me a replacement
268	pos	I'll have no mouse for days
268	pos	The requirements for the evidence:Before the replacement product will be released, we request that you permanently disable your current product in a safe manner and provide us with pictures of the complete, disabled product from three different angles, one of these pictures should clearly show the product details such as PID/SN, and include a handwritten note with your case number (XXXXXXX) in each of the photos
268	pos	I again expressed my dissatisfaction and that I need to use the mouse until the new one arrives
268	pos	If I end up having to do this I'll be buying a new mouse from a company with better support before I follow through with disabling the mouse and getting the replacement I should have already gotten
268	pos	EDIT: The agent went ahead and shipped the new mouse without requiring evidence of disabling the old mouse
268	pos	I could have waited a day to see their response but I was pretty frustrated
268	pos	While it is a shame I had to complain to get around these requirements they still accommodated me, so I've given back 3 stars for a 4 star rating
268	pos	Not counting my experience with customer support I would have given this mouse 5 stars
269	pos	I've owned this mouse for about a month or so now and haven't had any issue yet
269	pos	I've got pretty big hands and this mouse feels great to me
269	pos	All the buttons are easy to reach without feeling like I have to stretch or pull my hand back
269	pos	The ghub software is easy enough to work with
269	pos	It didn't take me more than a few minutes to get the buttons assigned how I wanted them
269	pos	Also, I've noticed a few reviews that complain that the scroll wheel "breaks" and keeps on spinning
269	pos	There is literally a button below the scroll wheel that changes the scroll wheel mode between standard scrolling and infinite scrolling
269	pos	If you think your scroll wheel "broke", just hit the button
269	pos	Some people have complained about double clicking developing over time
269	pos	I haven't had the mouse long enough to get that problem, but if it ever does I'll come back to edit this review
269	pos	Overall, nothing but positive feedback from me
269	pos	I don't think you'll find a better mouse at this price point
270	pos	Got it for the amount of buttons and was surprised by the level of customization
270	pos	Equally surprised was how quickly the bloody thing start double clicking - 2 months
270	pos	Was very annoyed and disappointed until figured out how to replace the switches to Japanese ones
270	pos	Not terribly difficult, just extra work and cost for no reason - $3-10 extra
270	pos	All in all works fine now, but Logitech need to get its sources together; Chinese switches are garbage
271	pos	I'm on my third mouse, I'm too spoiled with the functionality of these gaming mice Logitec has
271	pos	The button setup on the G502 is so easy to hit with your index and thumb
271	pos	The only issues that make these unreliable, is there is a defect that causes the left click to double click
271	pos	So dragging windows, or playing games etc
271	pos	can be frustrating at times
271	pos	There are ways to self fix it, but it requires opening the mouse, which I wont do
271	pos	They are cost effective though and I've only had this defect happen once
272	pos	I had been looking at more costly alternatives for some time
272	pos	I had many mice before this one, but I have to say that this one has won the gold medal so far
272	pos	I have set my dpi to 450 with ease and usually, that remains so, though some issues with the software have had me go change it back through the time I have had it over all this is not a big issue
272	pos	The quality feels nice, the clickiness is responsive, the setup is economical, and the bottoms are efficient
272	pos	Definitely consider this mouse for shooters
273	pos	I love this little guy
273	pos	I love the ability to switch to different dpi on the spot or its ability to work on almost all surfaces — including bed sheets with lines on them or glass surfaces
273	pos	My only wish/want was that there were more areas this mouse could light up with RGB
273	pos	It’s just a couple of spots, sadly
273	pos	Also, the profiles can have a hard time sticking and being saved
273	pos	This can be a bit frustrating with having to adjust your options every so often
273	pos	I love the response and action on the buttons
273	pos	I especially love the ergonomic positioning of the additional buttons and the ability to program all the buttons to macros or keyboard strokes
273	pos	If you’re looking for a little bit of flair with your mouse and the ability to customize your buttons exactly as you want, this mouse is a great option for competitive and MMO gaming
273	pos	Just a little more light in the next revision
273	pos	Please
274	pos	I love my Logitech mice and this one performs very well too
274	pos	The software is simple and it tracks great on my mouse pad
274	pos	I would be great for gaming or detailed editing work
274	pos	My main problem with this mouse is that it is too small for most grown men or adults who would wear size large gloves
274	pos	This negates any ergonomic benefits because you have to grip it incorrectly
274	pos	If you have large hands and ergonomics are important to you, I would suggest looking for something larger
275	neg	I had to return this twice to amazon since they both came in used, so I bought mine elsewhere but this is a review of the product and not amazon
275	neg	The mouse itself has good build quality, crisp clicks and a good amount of programmable buttons
275	neg	A nice touch is the infinite scroll wheel ability, but I do not like the side to side feature of the middle mouse button
275	neg	This causes the middle mouse button to rattle when moving your mouse quickly and it feels off
275	neg	Another major issue for me is the weight, it is way heavy for an FPS mouse
275	neg	Finally, the ergonomics is very counter intuitive
275	neg	The sniper button is way too close to the thumb, and the left grips follow the shape of the thumb, which is what you don't want as it can slip out of your hand easily
275	neg	I am a palm mouse gamer and this is definitely not suited for palm
276	neg	Everything about this mouse is 1st class except the scroll wheel
276	neg	The wheel is extremely well made but it is solid metal and slippery
276	neg	I have to press down pretty hard to keep it from slipping
276	neg	This means no middle mouse button
276	neg	If Logitech were to use the wheel from the 903 this would be the perfect mouse
276	neg	Update 11/30/2020: I could not live with it any longer and ordered a new mouse
276	neg	The G502 is fantastic but the mouse wheel makes it very difficult to use
276	neg	It is just too slippery
276	neg	For normal browsing it is fine but for anything requiring precision it does not work
276	neg	This is especially problematic when gaming
277	pos	The mouse is a bit smaller than I expected and some of the button locations make it really easy to hit buttons you didn't mean to
277	pos	I like the adjustable weights
277	pos	I was much happier with the size when I found a good weight for me
277	pos	The software, G-Hub is hot garbage
277	pos	It's 50/50 whether it detects a program launch if you have a profile set up for that program
277	pos	Setting up custom binds is pretty straightforward, but not simple
277	pos	I had trouble getting some key combinations working as expected
277	pos	The RGB lighting is also a little confusing to set up and doesn't integrate with HP/Omen RGB controls
277	pos	That's disappointing
278	pos	Bought this as a replacement for a G500 that did good service for about 9 years until a spring failed and it started double-clicking randomly
278	pos	I bought a Steelseries Rival 5 based on reviews, and let me tell you, it's a piece of junk next to this G502
278	pos	Not only did the Steelseries Rival 5 lock up randomly when connected to my KVM switch (a problem I've never had with a Logitech mouse), it also had generally inferior build quality and was missing the free-spin button for the mouse wheel
278	pos	Overall this is a great mouse
278	pos	Very happy
279	neg	I loved the feel of the mouse
279	neg	It fit my hand well
279	neg	I liked being able to adjust the weight of the mouse
279	neg	The software was alright
279	neg	My largest complaint is I bought my original mouse about 1
279	neg	5 years ago
279	neg	I had to RMA it about 8 months in because my right and left mouse clicks were having problems
279	neg	The replacement I have is experiencing the same problems now about 7 months later
279	neg	I do not play games nearly as much as I used to
279	neg	My previous Logitech mice lasted years of heavy gaming for hours each day before experiencing the same issues
279	neg	Disappointed at the quality
279	neg	I'll be trying a different brand to see if it lasts longer than 7 months
280	pos	A decent mouse for the money, lots of buttons
280	pos	For normal computer use, it's outstanding
280	pos	My one complaint with it applies to every single gaming mouse I've ever used:  the mouse wheel doesn't have enough resistance, so when you use it as a button while gaming, it tends to roll forward or backward too, which has unintended consequences in 99% of games
280	pos	It'd be nice if just ONE manufacturer made a stiffer wheel, or a special lock button for it
281	pos	I had a logitech mouse a long time ago, and it was amazing, as was the customer service when it eventually broke
281	pos	When it was time to get a new mouse I tried various brands over the years
281	pos	HyperX, Corsair,  Razer, and a couple others of the most popular brands which I don’t remember
281	pos	Nope
281	pos	Logitech makes solid gaming mice
281	pos	This is the best gaming mouse I’ve owned since My last logitech mouse
281	pos	It just feels good
281	pos	At this point, I think I will only buy logitech mice for the rest of my life
281	pos	Just nothing but quality
282	pos	Wish the mouse wheel had a firmer scroll when it's not on the option of free flow
282	pos	And it kind of clunks the top most weight around when I make a flick da wrissss
282	pos	Just a noise though, not an actual problem
282	pos	Definetely took my accuracy in games, and put it where it should have been this whole time
282	pos	Use to miss shots all the time because my 10$ wireless mouse obviously didn't have the hero sensor
282	pos	Got use to the extra buttons over time and it's made fortnites building concept more convienent for me
282	pos	And the software is easy to learn from Logitech
282	pos	Programming buttons on the mouse to act as other keys from the keyboard, or even multi-key shortcuts
282	pos	Plus the 3 different profiles in the programming option makes it easy to switch from my fortnite dpi, to my casual internet browsing dpi, as well as my button lay out being different on all 4 profiles
282	pos	Totally worth the 80$
282	pos	But if you're on a budget, and need to see that extra 30 bucks, the previous version is going to be practically the exact same thing
282	pos	Enjoy
282	pos	Because you are buying this mouse
282	pos	😉
283	neg	I've been using this mouse for 1
283	neg	5 years now
283	neg	Worked great in the beginning but just got worse over time
283	neg	For a while it wasn't switching to the correct profile for the game I launched so I'd have to manually switch it but that behavior eventually stopped, I assume after updates
283	neg	For the last four months or so, it will randomly change the DPI under the different profiles I created
283	neg	Not happy with this thing and will be shopping around for something else
284	neg	Rated 50 million clicks my butt
284	neg	There's no way any of these mice would have passed that test unless shortcuts were taken
284	neg	Like many have posted here, after a while the mouse starts clicking 10 times for every 1 click you do
284	neg	It starts to effect both left and right clicking
284	neg	I can't even drag files on my comp anymore because it drops them or opens them up because it's registering me clicking 80 times
284	neg	-_- As advise, I heard that the model before the G502 Hero didn't suffer the same click issues
284	neg	They must have gone with a cheaper manufacturer
284	neg	I used to have a Logitech headset as well (G930/$115) and it died just as quickly
284	neg	I won't be buying anymore Logitech products anymore
284	neg	They are as crappy and short lasting as Razer
285	pos	I've been using a cheap $5 mouse for years
285	pos	Has it gotten the job done
285	pos	Sure, it's worked just fine
285	pos	But this is a serious upgrade and it's well worth every penny spent
285	pos	It has huge configurability with the buttons, which is a definite plus but one I am least likely to fully utilize
285	pos	The big benefit to me is the adjustable weights
285	pos	That is absolutely huge and a factor that I hardly ever considered
285	pos	Additionally, having the native ability to switch mouse sensitivity on the fly is amazing
285	pos	Overall, this mouse is incredible and there is nothing so far I can report to dislike about it
285	pos	Highly recommended
286	pos	It's a Logitech mouse, so it seems to be sturdy and functions well so far
286	pos	I've had it for 3 days now and only have 2 problems
286	pos	First is the size, it's the new "normal" (smaller) size mouse that doesn't fit as well in larger hands, can't see this in the pictures
286	pos	Second is the mouse wheel spins freely
286	pos	This is neat for scrolling through long pages quickly, but I haven't found anything else that the usual stiffer mouse wheel isn't better for
286	pos	But watch out using this "gaming" mouse for gaming, unless you want to be zooming in/out or swapping weapons constantly
286	pos	UPDATE: Turns out there's a button on it to stiffen the mouse wheel to not spin freely
286	pos	The only documentation with the mouse is the warning in about 20 languages, an ad, and the "instructions" with a picture of the usb cable and a usb port telling you how to plug it in
286	pos	Otherwise, it's a great mouse
286	pos	If you don't have larger hands then the size probably won't be an issue for you, but be warned about the scroll wheel before you make your decision
286	pos	Definetely still worth the money
287	neg	I play a browser based game called diep
287	neg	io
287	neg	its high action and you are constantly aiming the cursor at enemy tanks
287	neg	There is no time the cursor is not moving on this game
287	neg	For some reason my G502 wired mouse pauses slightly were i have to pick the mouse up and set it back down
287	neg	Its horrible for diep
287	neg	io since the slightest pause of the mouse cursor in the wrong spot could be instant death
287	neg	Ive been changing settings and trying everything I can
287	neg	But I'm to the point I want to return it
287	neg	Hoping the wireless version might be better
287	neg	Or maybe just a faulty wired version
287	neg	Whoo knows but I feel like throwing the damn thing into the wall when I get to level 45 and get killed cause my mouse stops and the precision shooting is compromised
287	neg	UHGThe reason for two starts is the mouse works great for everything else
288	pos	The G502 series are the top-selling mice on planet Earth (I dunno about other places)
288	pos	This member of the 502 family, the Logitech G502 HERO, takes a great mouse (G502 Proteus Spectrum RGB Tunable) with a great heritage (G502 Proteus Core) and makes it even greater
288	pos	The HERO sensor offers even sharper tracking of your smallest input (up to 16,000 DPI vs 12,000) and OMRON switches for ludicrous durability (50M vs
288	pos	10M)
288	pos	The Logitech G502 mice have always offered excellent balance between feature set, material & build quality, recognizable branding, and fair pricing
288	pos	Why should I pay more or settle for less
288	pos	Why would you
288	pos	(I am a non-affiliated customer/fan)
289	pos	This thing is pretty darn good
289	pos	Rock solid construction
289	pos	Very responsive without being touchy
289	pos	Able to set the G keys to be any key I want them to be
289	pos	Easy to do macros for gaming
289	pos	DPI settings can go as high as you need to have full movement on screen with minimal movement on the mousepad
289	pos	Im going to be ordering 3 or 4 more of these because I hate having to learn a new mouse if it goes bad later on down the road
289	pos	I doubt it will fail any time soon cause I have a G13 game pad from Logitech and its been working perfectly for the past 6 years
290	pos	Great mouse with one serious design flaw
290	pos	After several months of use, left mouse button starts to register multiple click even though only one click pressed
290	pos	This can be very frustrating when you need do an drag function, like dragging files to different folder or highlighted text
290	pos	This is a well known issue that has been forward to logitech and I'm hoping they fixed this defect in their newer release because ignoring the defect, this mouse is quite good
291	pos	I spent a ton of time researching a new high DPI gaming mouse for my setup
291	pos	I even went as far as visiting local stores to ensure that the mouse works with my hand
291	pos	Mice and keyboards are one of the most subjective items to rate or recommend, because everyone has different tastes
291	pos	As a result, I think it's worth taking the time to visit a shop that will allow you to demo what you're looking for
291	pos	Once you figure that out, and want something that's great for claw gripping, and versatile enough to match other styles, look no further (unless you have a crazy budget and can afford the light speed wireless version)
291	pos	The only downside is that the software is required if you want any of the features
291	pos	This is not an issue if you have a modern computer with enough RAM
291	pos	However, if you have an aversion to background programs, maybe look for something that doesn't require software (Steel Series)
292	neg	This is my second G502 Hero mouse
292	neg	I've bought 2 of these things because I've been a life-long Logitech fan
292	neg	This mouse is amazing, until it isn't
292	neg	With both of the mouses, the left and right click would release randomly while I would have the button pressed down
292	neg	Making it impossible to aim in FPS titles
292	neg	At first I thought it was just a bad mouse the first time, but when I got a second one the same exact thing happened
292	neg	Something is wrong with the build quality or the parts they use inside of this mouse
292	neg	It worked great for a couple of months, and then the problems started
292	neg	Shop somewhere else
293	neg	The mouse itself seems fine
293	neg	It's reasonably comfortable and adjustable weight
293	neg	There are some production issues where it ends up double clicking but Logitech will do replacements on them
293	neg	The problem is the Logitech G Hub is absolute garbage software
293	neg	Apparently Razer is pretty bad too but good god this thing sucks
293	neg	Unfortunately you have to use it to store profiles and things and it is crap
293	neg	Issues I've had include losing profiles, not switching profiles, hanging on firmware updates, graphical problems in the software, crashes, and just a general terrible UI and UX design
293	neg	Don't count on future updates fixing the software either as I've had this mouse for over a year and it's a crapshoot whether a software update will make things worse or not
293	neg	So yeah
293	neg	The mouse is fine, the software is crap
293	neg	I'm considering getting something different and never going back to logitech sadly
294	neg	I've purchased this thing for 3 times in a Row, I've been a fan of Logitech products for years but I guess this is the end
294	neg	This thing will let you down with double click issues within the first or second month of use, so you better look something else, save your money
295	pos	Its 4 star, would I get it again
295	pos	No
295	pos	Cons:-The mouse wheel is ridiculous, it spins like crazy, I struggle to model 3d or animate anything with this mouse, like just a touch and your camera/scroll is all the way up or down, so I'm at odds
295	pos	(I rarely use the mouse wheel for gaming, but if you do, that's just you, haha
295	pos	)-Programmable almost perfect but I'd like a triple click button for gaming, its possible, I just have to do some coding, and that's just the problem, I don't want to code at this point in my life, I just need a mouse, there's a limited set of options to program, the people need more options, so my advice, is just get a mouse with a x3 click option or whatever specific thing you've experienced with the mouse you trying to replacePro:- It feels great, great enough to get past the cons, especially if a mouse wheel from the fast and furious is your thing
295	pos	-Its RGB lit with a minimal design
295	pos	so your thumb could cover all fancy custom light settings
296	pos	Compare against several Razer mice and other Logitech mice, this is my favorite for gaming
296	pos	Ergonomics are perfect(assuming you don't need it to be ambidextrous)
296	pos	Three thumb keys and two extra index finger keys are perfect for assigning vital actions in a game
296	pos	Adjustable sensitivity
296	pos	Smooth or lock to click scroll wheel is a must have in every mouse
296	pos	I have three(one for my PC, one for guest PC, and one for work machine in office)
296	pos	The first one is probably 3-4 years old now and still works perfectly
296	pos	Highly recommend getting the Razer hardtop/plastic mouse pad with this
296	pos	It doesn't work with Chroma, but it's butter smooth and never frays like a fabric pad would
297	pos	To put it simply, this mouse seems perfectly fine in terms of form and function
297	pos	I haven't had any noticeable issue with buttons and software or tracking, regardless of application
297	pos	The only issue is that the design of the mouse makes it some what annoying to clean
297	pos	Besides the crevices that are all over the place, especially around the buttons, the sides also have textured rubbery grips
297	pos	Dirt and grime and accumulate within the textured triangles and can be very annoying to clean unless you are wiping it down daily
298	pos	I had the first gen G602 before this and the only thing that ended up failing on that was the left click, but that was after about 4+ years of constant use
298	pos	This mouse is identical to that one with an RGB light(which I just disable anyway) and a slightly different colour scheme for the removeable cover for the weights
298	pos	But this mouse is absolutely perfect for me
298	pos	The thumb wrest on the side is perfect
298	pos	The thumb buttons are also in a really good place, I never find myself accidently hitting any or finding I can't reach one, with the exception of the button furthest forward, but I never use that anyway
298	pos	Also the smooth scroll is great for scrolling through long websites light twitter or the like
298	pos	As someone who has had a version of this mouse for years and have had no issues with this one, I definitely recommend this too anyone looking for a good mouse
299	neg	Seems like a nice mouse
299	neg	Has software/hardware issues
299	neg	G logic software won’t recognize my mouse unless I uninstall software, and plug in the mouse as I open the software again
299	neg	Restarting my PC resets this
299	neg	This makes me not be able to control my DPI
299	neg	I play CS GO and the dpi mouse settings are placed in such a bad area, without being able to lock out settings, I constantly accidentally change my dpi settings
299	neg	Super annoying
299	neg	Returning
300	pos	This is the best mouse I've ever used
300	pos	hands down
300	pos	for productivity, for gaming, anything
300	pos	The sensor on this thing is so amazing - I've used even other gaming mice, some more expensive than this, and this sensor blows them out of the water, I think likely due to the frequency at which it communicates with the computer (which is 1000 times per second)
300	pos	the mouse is just so precise - aiming in video games is much steadier, and it helps me so much with productivity because i can move the mouse so quickly and not overshoot whatever I'm trying to click
300	pos	it's also ergonomically so comfortable - my hands are quite large (can easily reach 10ths on a piano if that means anything to you), so a lot of mice feel a bit small to me
300	pos	This mouse's shape somehow fits my hand comfortably, and the rubber sides make for a very nice grip
300	pos	there's some extra things that aren't crucial to me but are nice, such as the RGB, adjustable weights, and scroll wheel free/notched toggle, but they're certainly appreciated
300	pos	tldr: this mouse is the one
301	pos	This mice is just so comfortable to hold in my hand
301	pos	I'm switching from the G900, which sadly broke from my recent move and I lost its side button pieces, which I needed for a game function
301	pos	Having the option to have more than 2 extra programmable buttons never appealed to me before, but now with the particular game I'm playing, it just makes my life easier
301	pos	The grip on the mice is perfect for me, I can move this thing on my entire pad without a break, smoothly
301	pos	It just glides
301	pos	Another thing never appealed to me was the weights
301	pos	I never understood its purpose, until I had the option to have them
301	pos	I popped them all in, and played around with the mouse for an hour or two, and honestly, I like it more than I thought I would
301	pos	They're staying in
301	pos	If you're for some reason a new Logitech user, be sure to download the Logitech Gaming Software to program the buttons and lighting effects
302	pos	I've always loved Logitech products and peripherals, from headphones to mousepads, so when I saw this one on sale for half the regular list price, I knew I had to jump on it
302	pos	Like any good gaming mouse you can customize the weights in the bottom compartment, it's soft and pleasant material, features a ton of customizable buttons and DPI control as well as the free scroll mechanic (both hilarious and useful for someone like me who frequently works on and edits VERY long documents)
302	pos	Customizable color RGB through the G Hub app as well
302	pos	Gaming feels like a breeze with everything more precise, the buttons more responsive, and a clear rise in quality from my last model
302	pos	I recommend this mouse to anyone who prefers a wired model and is looking for something to game with
303	neg	I've been using the G500 series for several years now and replaced an older G502 with this new one
303	neg	It seems that Logitech's quality has slipped
303	neg	There is an issue with the motion sensor on this mouse that causes the cursor/character to stick when turning while having the right mouse button clicked/depressed
303	neg	I have cleaned the mouse, cleaned the mouse pad, swapped out mouse pads, and the issue persists
303	neg	Not to mention at one point the G500 series mouse were easily configurable, DPS and button wise
303	neg	But now the new G Hub software has you locked and the presets for the various games aren't what I want
303	neg	Editing of the built in profiles seems to be unavailable
304	pos	Sensor is not bad, even if there are better out there in 2022
304	pos	Quality of material, for the price, its more than acceptable
304	pos	Ergonomics, this mouse is mostly for PALM grip
304	pos	IF you have any other type of grip style, I would stay away
304	pos	Big cons IMO, the scroll wheel is absolute garbage
304	pos	Possibly the worst I have ever experienced on a mouse above $20 bucks
304	pos	Buttons do not feel solid in any way
304	pos	QC just isn't there IMO
305	pos	This is probably the best mouse I ever used
305	pos	Although it has more buttons than the previous mouse I bought, but I did prefer the layout of the buttons more than this one
305	pos	I feel this mouse is ideal for shooters while the one I used prior was more rounded to almost any mouse I used
305	pos	That being said, this mouse has weights that give it a heavier feel which I love
305	pos	The other mouse was very light weighted and felt cheap
305	pos	This is built like a brick and works amazingly
305	pos	16000dpi is beyond what I have ever felt for a mouse so I keep mine around 4000dpi
305	pos	It gives a nice speed to the mouse
305	pos	Lastly the mouse is fully custom with lighting with full rgb
305	pos	Custom buttons and uses the new Ghub software
305	pos	Although I feel that logitech has some issues in their software dept
305	pos	So far this has been really great
306	neg	I used it for two weeks and found that right button would always work, so for that allow I returned it
306	neg	Can say I really liked it beyond that anyways
306	neg	The dpi buttons are in a bad places as I was always hitting one with my left figure and the adjustment of dpi was bad
306	neg	I the slowest was far to slow for me and the next up was to fast, so I could get it in a comfortable place
306	neg	The design of the mouse is not great as it is rounded on the right side so I was always lifting the mouse when moving right and losing movement on screen
306	neg	Also if you don't have anything but a small hand the mouse is most liekly going to be to small for you
306	neg	Overall can't say I really liked anything about as even the look is kind of ugly
307	neg	Bought the mouse back in May 2019, noticed issues with the right mouse button within 3 months
307	neg	Potentially a firmware issue, could be hardware, but regardless its common in this mouse and will come up with a quick google search
307	neg	Most noticeable is that the right mouse button will bounce when pressed
307	neg	This will manifest in either the mouse double clicking with a single press, or not being able to maintain a held press without registering additional clicks
307	neg	For gaming, this makes the mouse completely unreliable - You will not be able to confidently ADS in fps games, and you will not be able to pan your screen in games with right click drag
307	neg	The quality of the mouse switches do not live up to the rest of the mouse - every other feature has been great,but at the end of the day I need a mouse that can right click
307	neg	I would not recommend this mouse to anyone, and would point instead to the Razer Basilisk, which was built to profit off the success of this mouse ironically, but has access to optical sensors and Razer build quality
308	neg	I have had this mouse for almost a year and a half and am now experiencing an issue where single clicking results in multiple clicks on my left mouse button
308	neg	It won't stay pressed which makes highlighting text and dragging across the screen impossible and infuriating
308	neg	This is not the first time I've had issues with Logitech mice
308	neg	Will not be purchasing them ever again
308	neg	Positives: Comfortable to hold, weighty, nice to the touch, cool lights, lots of features
308	neg	If it didn't have this issue, this would be a 5 star product
309	neg	Purchased on August 7, 2020, writing review on July 30, 2020
309	neg	This mouse served me well for about 6 months
309	neg	after that, it started acting up with some random double-clicking and click+hold interruption
309	neg	While its prime it was a great mouse as the software that accompanies it is quite handy with customizable DPI for different applications and quite a large range of choice, but I call it quits today when my automatic fire click and hold was interrupted several times in the same game causing me to lose two perfectly good ambushes in Siege
309	neg	Great mouse, just be ready to shill out another 50 every 6 months to a year maybe
310	pos	First off, just going to vent about QC:First mouse I got the lights stopped working after about a month
310	pos	Second mouse had two issues, the right click button sometimes double clicks so if I am scoping in playing any FPS game, it will scope out or jitter
310	pos	Super annoying
310	pos	The second issue is the pad on the bottom of the mouse kept getting caught  on my mouse pad
310	pos	Must have been poorly placed or something
310	pos	Like a tiny piece of the plastic sticks outwards and scratches the mouse pad
310	pos	Using the mouse:I want to preface this by saying I use palm grip
310	pos	If you use claw grip you might have different (better) results
310	pos	Anyway the ergonomics are actually trash
310	pos	Some of the "extra" buttons are too easy to accidentally press
310	pos	This happens from time to time when you are playing games and your arm gets stiff and you adjust your grip
310	pos	Boom accidentally touched like 4 buttons
310	pos	The biggest offenders are the left and right mouse-3 inputs (where you tilt the mouse wheel in one direction) and the 3rd mouse button on the side
310	pos	The 2 extra buttons on the left mouse button are just too out of reach of the index finger
310	pos	Definitely have better experience using those buttons with claw grip
310	pos	Conclusion:Unfortunately at this price point you won't find much else that is better
310	pos	The only other ones are just random Chinese products that have low quality sensors, even if they look flashy
310	pos	Hence my 3-star review
310	pos	Thanks for reading
311	neg	I purchased this device for my gaming PC to have a quality gaming mouse
311	neg	I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase
311	neg	The mouse will randomly disconnect while I am in the middle of using it
311	neg	I originally thought it could possibly be my USB ports on my PC or something of the sort, but after trying to use it on another computer the problem continued
311	neg	The mouse will disconnect for about a second from my computer and reconnect again right after, but in the middle of gaming that is not acceptable
311	neg	The mouse feels amazing in your hand and is easy to control using the Logitech application, but if the product disconnects like it is, it cannot be used for gaming
312	pos	I’ve been looking for a nice gaming mouse, and if you are too, you can click Add to Cart
312	pos	The Logitech G502 Hero works absolute wonders
312	pos	For starters, the weight customization is amazing
312	pos	You can change how heavy the mouse is to fit your own needs, and it comes with plenty of extra weights
312	pos	It has bright LED’s on the mouse, which can be customized for different colours and effects
312	pos	There are 3 buttons on the left side of the mouse, for the thumb; 2 buttons next to the LMB; and one button in the middle (besides the scroll lock)
312	pos	It has a nice clicking sound and it’s easy to click fast on it
312	pos	It connects to the computer via a braided usb cable
312	pos	It also has a very nice scroll wheel, and overall it feels very sturdy and well-made
312	pos	Now about the software
312	pos	Logitech GHub is a simple install for this, and it is very user friendly
312	pos	You can make macros, shortcuts, change lighting, and remap buttons on the mouse with ease
312	pos	You can also sync the lighting to your Logitech Keyboard
312	pos	I have had no issues with it thus far, and it is likely my favourite accessory to my computer
312	pos	Now compatibility
312	pos	I am using a 2019 Macbook Pro, and the mouse works with all features
312	pos	It does not lose any features compared to Windows, which occurs with many mice
312	pos	TL;DR-Pros•Well-made•Weight customization•Easy and fast clicking•Remappable Buttons•LED Customization•Fantastic software•Perfect compatibility with Macbooks-Cons•I can’t give it a six star rating
313	neg	Another casualty of war
313	neg	I purchased this mouse in April 2020 and now it's the end of January 2021
313	neg	Just under a year old and the double click/click and drag fail has begun
313	neg	From what I've gathered, it's a well known hardware issue that pertains to the switches
313	neg	The problem is clicking, holding and dragging
313	neg	The click releases and then clicks again while dragging
313	neg	There's been posts of customer's having this problem right out of the box
313	neg	The only way to resolve it is by ordering different switches, voiding your warranty, and attempting to replace them yourself
313	neg	The mouse feels good and the option to add weight is nice but not necessary
313	neg	I like the RGB and extra buttons but the mouse wheel feels a bit derpy
313	neg	I did end up getting used to that though
313	neg	What you can't get used to is the broken primary and secondary buttons releasing while click holding
313	neg	Someone on Reddit mentioned a macro fix and it has helped many but it has not helped me
313	neg	This is a hardware issue
313	neg	I thought maybe it was firmware but no
313	neg	I have updated and still not working properly
313	neg	I'm very upset with this and I will be contacting their customer support for a replacement
313	neg	What an inconvenience
313	neg	2 stars for being a beautiful paperweight in one year
314	pos	The weights are a cool concept (although I ended up only using one, usually I like light mice)
314	pos	The main con: The unlockable scroll wheel sort of moves a bit/creates a rattle if you move the mouse quickly, whether locked or unlocked
314	pos	It really is not very noticeable when using, but that is my only issue with the mouse
314	pos	Otherwise, all of the side buttons are placed very nicely to be able to use while gaming without having to really move your hand
314	pos	It glides nicely
314	pos	The build quality is definitely good for the price point but not as good as some of the more expensive logitech mice
315	neg	a bit on the bigger side so its a little harder for me to hit the dpi button but its doable
315	neg	build quality is good and egos are great
315	neg	logitech app works greatEDIT: After just seven months the left click button is now constantly double clicking
315	neg	It's impossible to play games or even drag a window from one monitor to another
315	neg	I tried to contact customer support and they want a video of the mouse clicking and several other steps before they will even consider taking it back
315	neg	I probably sound a little entitled but I'm not the only person who has had this issue with this mouse that's less than a year old, the onus should be on logitech to prove that their product that is know to have this fault is working, not on me to prove its broke
316	neg	I want to start by saying I love love love this mouse
316	neg	Feels nice in my hand, love the weight adjustability option
316	neg	Overall I've just gotten really familiar and attached to it for no reason
316	neg	For just every day use and playing my favorite games, this worked wonderful
316	neg	for a while
316	neg	Unfortunately, I have now experienced the constant click/double click issue
316	neg	I bought this mouse back in September 2020, it's now June 2020
316	neg	I first noticed the click issues, minor at first, around April
316	neg	When I clicked and held, expecting to shoot in R6S, it would shoot one bullet, then pause, and maaaaybe continue intermittently
316	neg	Usually I'd have to click again and by then it was too late, I was dead
316	neg	At first I thought it might be how I was gripping and clicking on the mouse button
316	neg	As time got on it has gotten worse and expanded to the right mouse key as well - I can no longer aim down my sight consistently, it either doesn't register, or puts me in only to take me immediately out, no matter how I click or grip the mouse
316	neg	During the time I've had the mouse, I've been using it daily for several hours - so I'd consider it heavy usage
316	neg	It served me well for a large majority of my time
316	neg	To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or takes its sweet time and clicks however many times it wants while dragging
316	neg	This creates a lot of issues with my gaming so I will be purchasing a different mouse to replace this one :(
317	pos	I want to start by saying this was bought as a replacement for my other (2018) G502 that I myself broke while cursing the developers of a certain franchise
317	pos	First and foremost, this mouse is incredibly well constructed
317	pos	I mean, to take a beating like it did and STILL function was something a Corsair/Razer mouse could never dream of achieving (I would know)
317	pos	Second, lets bring some attention to the mouse wheel
317	pos	For me, it's always the first thing to go on a mouse, this one was the exception
317	pos	Even after the beat down it STILL functioned flawlessly and I cannot believe it
317	pos	Also, a free spinning mouse wheel with a mechanical toggle switch was for sure something I didn't realize I needed in my life at the time
317	pos	Third, this mouse is incredibly budget friendly, especially when it's on sale
317	pos	To be honest, I don't actually know how Razer and Corsair compete with this thing on the market
317	pos	Fourth, the adjustable weight may not seem like a big deal but if you're newer to PC gaming it'll offer you some versatility that others overlook
317	pos	If you've been looking for a sign to switch gaming mice, this is it
317	pos	You will not be disappointed
318	neg	The mouse overall was decent while it lasted
318	neg	However the software for the mouse is pretty poop
318	neg	There were numerous bugs with the software, manually starting the Logitech app every time I boot up was pretty annoying after awhile
318	neg	The software also struggled to read games that weren’t associated to steam, and I would have to manually map my buttons every time I hopped on them, like valorant (has since been fixed) and a few other non steam games
318	neg	I purchased this mouse in March and the left click broke in July
318	neg	a gaming mouse that has lasted me around five months, for a few hours a day
318	neg	There is no external damage to the mouse, nor has it ever been dropped
318	neg	The same day the left click broke the rgb decided to go out
318	neg	When I plugged it into a different port the port then shorted and broke the usb3 ports on the front of my computer
318	neg	There’s a reason it’s on sale all the time
318	neg	This mouse is probably worth the $40 if you’ve got money for a second one in a few months
318	neg	-Update: Amazon will be sending a replacement, after numerous attempts to get into contact with Logitech
318	neg	Does Logitech support just have a phone that rings all day in a noise proof room
318	neg	I’ve sat on hold with them for 30+ min three different days on a single week, no answer
318	neg	I’ve even left a message with a problem and callback number, that was two weeks ago, no answer
319	pos	The first Hero I bought had "unintended scrolling"
319	pos	What I mean is the scroll wheel was so off-balance the wheel would always rotate itself so the same spot was down
319	pos	I learned to never take my finger off the wheel, but this got old, so I returned it for the older model Proteus
319	pos	That one came, but the USB cord was so deformed coming out the front of it the mouse would stand-up on the mouse pad
319	pos	I tried to just straighten the cord, but it kept deforming and causing high friction against the mouse pad
319	pos	So I returned that one again, and the 3rd mouse was another Hero that is acceptable
319	pos	This scroll wheel stays in place as long as I don't bump the mouse
319	pos	So yay, I finally have a nice mouse
320	neg	This is the first and only mouse I've experienced this with and I've owned a lot of mice (primarily logitech)
320	neg	It fits comfortably in my hand and ergonomic but it's frustrating when you need to right click and drags something
320	neg	Opened a ticket with logitech support and was on the phone for 1 hour with support following their standard procedures
320	neg	Finally I was able to initiate a return and they wanted some standard information about the product but then they wanted a video showing my hand on the mouse while trying to right click and drag something to prove that the item is defective
320	neg	They also wanted me to send a picture of the serial number along with a written support ticket number on a piece of paper
320	neg	I have to say this was the oddest RMA I've ever done for a $50 product
320	neg	Support also claims that the replacement is not in stock and usually takes 2-3 weeks to get
321	neg	The mouse came fast and packaged perfectly but I only got about 5 minutes of use out of it before the mouse wheel broke
321	neg	This mouse uses some kind of pinwheel sensor for the scroll wheel that instantly becomes blocked and causes the the scroll wheel to ruin anything you're attempting to read with an uncontrollable up and down scrolling spasm that goes on for several seconds after you stop touching the scroll wheel
321	neg	I saw people mention it but didn't think it would be that big of a deal but this is terrible
321	neg	It causes an instant migraine
321	neg	Shame on Logitech for using this faulty design
322	neg	Could just be me but I didn't like this mouse
322	neg	After my son loaded some crazy setup in the memory it started acting up
322	neg	When I finally figured out how to use the software to clear the internal memory it would work normally again but then any other pc I plugged it into started having the same crazy problem(constant backspace)
322	neg	that would require another mouse to be able to download the software and set it to clear the internal memory to get it to work right again
322	neg	The mouse wheel was either to tight or if I used the free wheel it was to loose
322	neg	After fiddling with it I finally just threw it in the trash and replaced it with a $20 mouse
323	neg	Bought this mosue as a upgrade to the original G502 as this one goes up to 16K dpi while the older model maxed at 12K DPI
323	neg	Not more than 4 months after I got it I started noticing the right click would "double click" when clicked once or it wouldn't hold a click either
323	neg	Now 9 months later and the left click is going out too, whenever I click on the top of a window it double clicks for me maximizing the window
323	neg	This was never an issue with the original 502s, which i've had one last for a couple years before showing any signs of stopping
324	pos	My hand is 6 inches from palm edge to middle finger tip
324	pos	The mouse fits my hand well but not quite as high as I like to be really comfortable for a claw style grip
324	pos	That doesn't detract from the the options I use most
324	pos	I love the dpi-on-the-fly buttons right up by my left finger and the free spinning mouse wheel at the touch of a button
324	pos	I didn't think the provided weights would be enough but they actually work well
324	pos	I work 10+ hours a day with a lot of mouse use and this is a great mouse
325	neg	Purchased in July 2020, it is now April 2021, so give or take 9 months of use
325	neg	For about a month and a half now, the left mouse button doesn't click properly, sometimes it doesn't single click, often it doesn't hold a click (i
325	neg	e
325	neg	when making multiple selections, or holding down your fire button in a game)
325	neg	Amazon says the return and support window are closed
325	neg	Filing a warranty claim with Logitech is a last resort
325	neg	Kind of sad when your product has a shorter lifespan than the average magpie
326	neg	I had this mouse for about a year and some change, and I loved it
326	neg	Absolutely loved
326	neg	Unfortunately, the left mouse button started double clicking when I was single clicking or attempting to click and drag
326	neg	This made work and gaming impossible (double clicking an item in the game I play is a different action than single clicking), so I figured I'd replace it
326	neg	I bought the same brand as a replacement because I loved the mouse so much, and it had such a great review score so I figured it was a one-off fluke
326	neg	Within 2 months the new mouse had the same issue
326	neg	It was only then that I read the one star reviews and noticed how frequent this issue is
326	neg	I am only writing this review in an attempt to help the amazon review reach a more realistic score for such a flawed product
326	neg	If it had happened once I would have thought it me being unlucky
326	neg	But two of the same mouse had the same issue in such a short amount of time
326	neg	Now, I am looking at new mice again, and will be forced to switch brands
327	neg	Logitech has used (and continues to use) cheap switches in this mouse, which results in the mouse working fine for a few months, then your left and right buttons will begin to fail
327	neg	If you're holding down the left click, trying to move something around your desktop or charge up a shot in-game, the switch will register a quick release and re-click
327	neg	This issue is called double-clicking and is well documented with this mouse
327	neg	Logitech's customer support is also pretty terrible, so you won't get any help from them for several weeks, if ever, and the replacement devices will have the same bad switches
327	neg	Skip this mouse
327	neg	It's not worth the headache
328	neg	Everything worked fine for this mouse except after few months of use, the right click hold started to fail to stay on hold
328	neg	Not being able to hold right click consistently is a HUGE problem in FPS games as I don't use toggle ADS and other features like secondary fire needing consistent right click holds
328	neg	I kept firmware updated via their program and attempted to troubleshoot but problem still persisted
328	neg	If you google this product's name with right click, you'll see that many other people have the exact same problems as I have
328	neg	I'm surprised how this product is still highly rated
328	neg	Anyways I'm leaving this product 1 star due to unable to refund
329	neg	The mouse is otherwise functional, nice shape and feel
329	neg	However, when I downloaded the driver for High Sierra, the icon has an X through it indicating incompatibility with the OS
329	neg	There were some settings I wanted to adjust that could not be done in the Mac's native mouse dashboard
329	neg	I went to Logitech for customer service and the chat is a robot that sometimes crashed mid conversation
329	neg	And when I finally submitted 2 tickets, I never heard back
329	neg	That was 1 week ago
329	neg	Granted there was Christmas in there but still at least 3 business days passed
330	neg	the ergonomics are not great, it is very flat and long compared to other ergo mice i have
330	neg	It does not lend to easy use of holding and manipulating because of the flat profile
330	neg	It also seems very imprecise on cursor movement
330	neg	compared to a 3 year old MS mouse and a 5 year old Logitech wireless mouse, it does not move to desired spot as cleanly and accurately
330	neg	Which is disappointing, because I would think a wired mouse would actually perform better in this function
330	neg	I personally find the adjustable weight to be kind of pointless
330	neg	The only positive is the easy to program buttons
331	pos	I bought this mouse to replace my worn out Roccat Tyon gaming mouse
331	pos	I had never used a modern logitech mouse, much less the G502
331	pos	I decided to give it a try based on the reviews and the price
331	pos	I love the ability to add or remove the extra weights as needed
331	pos	The Logitech G hub software is easy to find and download, this is the app that allows to easily change advanced settings like LED color/brightness, and most importantly to customize the programmable buttons
332	neg	The mouse itself is fine
332	neg	Customizable and good remapping, but where it fails is the "Gaming mouse" portion
332	neg	The whole concept of a gaming mouse is to make it as ergonomic as possible
332	neg	Several of the key buttons fail to do so spectacularly
332	neg	While the mouse wheel being 2 different buttons for left and right pushing is a nice feature, I feel like there is a lot lost in some of the other buttons with how you need to basically curl your finger into your hand to reach them
332	neg	It makes it rather difficult to use the buttons seamlessly since you basically have to reposition your entire hand to reach them
332	neg	It was a nice try, but style does not beat efficiency
333	neg	I wanted so badly to like this mouse
333	neg	Unfortunately I just couldn't
333	neg	The mouse itself functioned pretty well, but the scrollwheel was a little unpredictable due to its many bells and whistles
333	neg	First off, it was really easy to hit the wheel left or right while scrolling, which could make my browser switch tabs
333	neg	It was also difficult to click the wheel without it registering as a lateral movement
333	neg	Lastly, I couldn't get past the shape
333	neg	The odd curves were really uncomfortable and caused some pretty intense cramps in my hand after little use
333	neg	Overall, this was one of the more poorly designed mice I've used in my day, which is unfortunate as I really respect Logitech
333	neg	Depending on your grip style you may find it more comfortable, but there's no getting past the weird wheel
334	neg	I owned the predecessor of this mouse for a very long time (before a "hero" version existed) and loved it
334	neg	I didn't even look around for other mice before buying this one
334	neg	The mouse itself seems to look pretty much the same, but the software is vastly different and worse and makes configuring the mouse miserable
334	neg	Some of the app's features flat out don't even work, like muting audio input
334	neg	The app's interface is also awful
334	neg	There are only a few settings but almost a dozen different screens with mostly redundant information and options
334	neg	Everything is just disabled if you prefer on-board settings
334	neg	You cannot directly edit an on-board profile, which was a core functionality of the previous app
334	neg	It may be better if you wanted to use the 'game profiles' feature but I think that's a sad excuse to permanently run a spyware program that scans all your installed programs and processes just for your mouse settings (just use the games' settings
334	neg	)
334	neg	The old app and onboard setting had its issues but actually worked, so I find these problems to be pretty glaring
334	neg	Update 2/22: this mouse has intermittent jumping issues and the software has not improved
334	neg	Will be buying a replacement from another manufacturer and if I could return this one still I would
334	neg	Very disappointing
335	pos	Logitech's return to greatness comes in the form of a well priced, well designed mouse
335	pos	The only flaw is the software, which borders on spyware for just how much information it requires to be able to edit your sensitivity
335	pos	Very strange, very awkward to use - Profiles swap whenever you change windows or run a game, for example - I eventually had to not only disable profiles entirely but set all four of my mouses DPI settings to 2400 just to get it to stay stable
335	pos	Some games didn't detect profiles correctly and others would lose their profiles when alt-tabbed, making shooters like Battlefield a nightmare to play
336	pos	I bought this mouse as I wanted more sensitive and accurate mouse operations
336	pos	After a year use, I don't think this mouse can be suitable for simple operations such as drag & drop
336	pos	After I want to drag something and press left button, it keeps losing the "grab" while dragging
336	pos	In addition, a single & long click is considered as double-click for some reason
336	pos	I never had this kind of problem with any other wired mouse
336	pos	Maybe it's because the mouse is for gaming
336	pos	But I wonder how gaming can be done with these issues
337	pos	Solid mouse at first but after 8 months I've noticed the left click to fail
337	pos	I cant click a tab and drag it
337	pos	It takes a few attempts
337	pos	I'll try to pause a video and it double clicks it making it full screen
337	pos	I thought it might be the double click timing being too fast so I manually adjusted it in the Win10 setting
337	pos	Didn't help, the problem persists
337	pos	Kind of a shame that this $50+ mouse doesn't last as long as my last LG mouse that was some cheapo kind that came with a keyboard for less than $15
337	pos	Edit: So I should add now that after contacting support and going through the troubleshooting they sent me a brand new one
337	pos	Took about three weeks from contacting their support to getting a replacement unit
338	pos	I have long fingers and needed a larger mouse to stop the claw grip required for smaller mice
338	pos	DPI setting flexibility is great
338	pos	Tracks very smoothly and I like the weights
338	pos	A heavier mouse feels better for some reason
338	pos	LED lights look cool even though I haven't messed with them yet
338	pos	Number and layout of buttons is adequate and something I'm still getting used to
339	neg	30 minutes waiting for customer support from Logitech and nobody picked up the phone
339	neg	Mouse is randomly double clicking both left and right
339	neg	When playing games it wont hold the clicks when aiming down the sight, the same happens when shooting you hold the left click and it randomly releases by itself
339	neg	Update:  I had to fix it myself I added some pictures in case some of you wanna try to replace  the switches
339	neg	I used those
339	neg	Good luck
340	neg	Initially this is a really great mouse
340	neg	It has very smooth control, finely tunable speeds, easy to access buttons, easy to understand lighting controls and DPI schemes
340	neg	However, while the product performs superior to even my Steel Series, it lacks the quality
340	neg	After a year of use the left click started sporadically working
340	neg	The click and hold fails often now
340	neg	The left click is the primary tool on this device, and as such, it failed too early
340	neg	I looked around on forums and others have experienced the same concern
340	neg	It isn't a driver issue, it is a quality of material issue
341	pos	Initially I received a used mouse, but the replacement one arrived quickly and works great
341	pos	This is a bulky mouse for sure, but it's ergonomic, smooth as glass, and comfy
341	pos	The scroll wheel lock is an awesome feature, and while the locked-wheel is a bit more clunky than I'd like, the unlocked wheel rolls around with ease
341	pos	Such a nice feature
341	pos	I also like the fact that this mouse isn't COVERED in the RGB-gamer-aesthetic too, you don't even have to use Logitech's spyware software, this mouse works right out of the box
342	neg	Update: The tracking comes and goes
342	neg	This is extremely disruptive to my gaming
342	neg	Cannot find any sort of fix
342	neg	Lowering the review to 1 star
342	neg	An hour into using this product, it's tracking has suddenly improved
342	neg	I do not know if it will remain consistent in this, but until it funks up again, I'm changing my review score to a 3 instead of a 1
342	neg	If it doesn't mess up at all, I'll be inclined to raise the review to 5 stars
342	neg	Unlike their predecessor, the hero version apparently doesn't give the option to turn off surface tuning
342	neg	This won't affect everyone
342	neg	but if you have the wrong mousepad, this mouse will not function properly for you, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it, except go buy new mousepads until you get one that works
342	neg	It will lose tracking frequently on the wrong surface, and the only option is to change the surface you use until you find one it deems suitable
342	neg	Edit: 8 months in, the gaming mouse is shot
342	neg	The left and right buttons won't hold consistently anymore, will have to replace the mouse
342	neg	If I had larger hands and pressed closer to the far tips of the buttons, it might not be so much of an issue
342	neg	might
342	neg	As it is, the mouse is useless to me now
343	neg	I bought this to replace an aging Logitech G500s that's been having issues lately
343	neg	The build quality of the G502 is nice
343	neg	Unfortunately I couldn't really use my new mouse because Logitech's G Hub config software just
343	neg	doesn't work on my PC (fully-updated Windows 10 Pro)
343	neg	It opens a completely black window that doesn't do anything
343	neg	Going by Logitech's forums and the LogitechG subreddit, it seems like G Hub is widely known to be really terrible and buggy
343	neg	The G502 is unfortunately not compatible with the older Logitech Gaming Software
343	neg	It's appalling to me that this premium gaming mouse from a long-trusted company like Logitech ships with software that is so poorly made
343	neg	I returned this mouse and got a Razer Basilisk, which works
344	neg	I've owned this mouse for a few days over a year and have gotten a lot of good use out of it
344	neg	Unfortunately, yesterday it started having an issue where it registers a single click or a click and drag as a double click
344	neg	I use this mouse for CAD, graphic design, and gaming so this issue is quite debilitating
344	neg	After doing some research online it seems that this issue is endemic to several Logitech products
344	neg	It would be one thing if this was a cheap mouse or if I'd owned it for a long time, but I shouldn't have to be looking to replace this expensive of a mouse after a little over a year
344	neg	Update: I ended up going through Logitech and utilizing their 2 year warranty
344	neg	I received a free replacement today about 3 weeks after starting the process via email
345	pos	I thought this probably one of the best mouse since its for gaming but I guess not
345	pos	This is a wired USB mouse however it lagging and sometimes not working its freeze like out of battery
345	pos	I then snapped different USB plugs but same problems occurred
345	pos	Therefore the problem is not my computer USB plugs but the mouse itself
345	pos	I bought this mouse to match my Logitech keyboard but I guess I make a mistake or got a defective
346	neg	Thankfully the 2 year warranty covered replacement, but at this point, what does that matter
346	neg	You're paying top dollar for a 'gaming' mouse and the buttons start to short out after less than 3 months of use
346	neg	I'm a gamer that games probably an average of about 2 hours a day
346	neg	I don't play intense FPS, I don't aggressively click or abuse my mice
346	neg	My last mouse lasted me literally 5+ years
346	neg	I've now gone through 2 of these in less than 6 months
346	neg	I'm not sure how this mouse is so highly rated if this is such a blatantly obvious manufacturers defect
346	neg	Go with a different brand
346	neg	Yes, the mouse is flashy and fun and has a lot of features, but go with something made with better quality materials
347	pos	I have very small hands, and the struggle is real when it comes to finding a gaming mouse
347	pos	This mouse, is still fairly large for me, but compared to a lot of other gaming mice out there, the contours and just the shape of it allow my hand to feel more comfortable holding, resting on it, and using it
347	pos	Pros: Comfortable
347	pos	Adjustable weight
347	pos	High quality build
347	pos	Customizable dpi presets
347	pos	Customizable rgb backlighting
347	pos	Cons: Still fairly large for my hand
347	pos	More buttons than I need (which is probably a pro for most people
347	pos	lol)
347	pos	The software must load for your rgb settings to take
347	pos	I think my biggest dislike is the convoluted and confusing software (Logitech Hub) that doesn't really give you clear instructions on how to use it
347	pos	Overall, I'm very pleased with this mouse choice so far
347	pos	There is a lot for me to learn regarding the Logitech Hub software if I ever care to dive deeper into it
348	pos	Great mouse with many options
348	pos	Can use macros and set buttons to do anything
348	pos	Has RGB options too
348	pos	Makes gaming easier with greater detail (compared to my old mouse)
348	pos	Very comfortable rubberized outer shell
348	pos	Good heft to it without even installing weights
348	pos	I'm able to leave the side lights on, and leave the logo on a breathing type pattern, so at a glance I can tell what my DPI is
348	pos	You can also make it only light up for a few seconds after input, but then you have to tap it to check
348	pos	Really nice options
349	pos	First I will say this is a quality gaming mouse
349	pos	It's well built, glides great on a hard mousepad
349	pos	buttons have a nice feel
349	pos	BUT if you have a wide hand (my palm is about 3 3/4 in wide) and use a palm gripping style this mouse is not for you
349	pos	I find it to be too narrow, both my middle and pinky fingers are dragging on the pad any my index is constantly activating the +DPI button when I am pressing button 1 (this was so bad I disabled the +DPI button altogether)
349	pos	I tried to like this mouse: worked and gamed with it for a week, but it's going back :(
350	neg	I purchased my G502 back in March, when it looked like I'd be working from home a lot more
350	neg	I needed a new mouse, and I game a lot, so my research led me to the G502 Hero
350	neg	I was very happy with it for the first three months; customizable buttons using the Logitech software was a breeze, and I loved the feel of the device
350	neg	Then, after four months of daily use, I noticed the mouse was double-clicking by itself sometimes
350	neg	Other times, the mouse would release a click while I was trying to drag something, which led to a lot of misplaced files, and unintended highlighting of text
350	neg	There is no rhyme or reason as to when these events happen, or in what application - it just randomly happens
350	neg	I'm very unhappy with the quality of the hardware here, despite the device's many positive aspects
350	neg	Since I'm already past Amazon's return cutoff, I'm going to have to file a warranty claim with Logitech, so that should be fun
350	neg	I'd advise buyers to avoid this mouse, because this appears to be a widespread issue
351	pos	It is labeled as a gaming mouse but it is a great mouse in general for every day use
351	pos	It is ergonomic, comfortable and smooth while moving
351	pos	It feels practically weightless while moving across the mousepad and it is the heaviest mouse I own
351	pos	The scroll wheels is one of the best I have ever used, it has two modes, a free scroll and a normal scroll
351	pos	Free scrolling is practically friction-less, and that's a good and bad thing
351	pos	Good when you like to scroll easily and sometimes bad when you move to another window and it keeps scrolling but that's mostly user error fault, not of the mouse
351	pos	The customization is crazy
351	pos	You can configure the 11 buttons to do all different things, not just the default mouse options
351	pos	I find this useful as I am always switching back and forth between the keyboard and mouse and sometimes I need quick actions on the mouse, this mouse can do that
351	pos	You can do keyboard shortcuts such as Alt+F4, or have it "click" a certain key to do something
351	pos	See the attached image
351	pos	Overall a great mouse and I highly recommend, the quality and feature-set is unmatched to any other mouse I have used
352	neg	I just needed a replacement mouse
352	neg	Should have went with a $10 device, but no-o-o-o
352	neg	I can't find a way to turn the lighting off
352	neg	I figured out how to slow the pointer down from ballistic speed
352	neg	Getting the wheel to roll in human units is vexing
352	neg	Just pack the manual in with the mouse
352	neg	Your LGHUB software is impossible to read
352	neg	(When did light gray on dark gray become acceptable
352	neg	) I guess it's my fault for being 70 years old
353	pos	I've had this mouse for a year now and I have no complaints whatsoever about it
353	pos	The software works great and I'm not an RGB fanatic so I really appreciate the simple accents on the mouse that I can customize
353	pos	I also love how I can make different profiles for different applications, mostly games, and how customizable the whole mouse is
353	pos	I have to say tho, this is probably not a mouse for people with small hands
353	pos	But for me, it fits comfortably in my hand has stood up to some abuse really well
353	pos	As far as the adjustable weights go, I think they are great but not a deal-breaker
353	pos	Overall, an amazing mouse that I could confidently recommend to anyone who wants a high-quality mouse or one with the extra buttons
354	neg	Like many others around here I have had a lot of issue with this mouse
354	neg	I have owned Logitech mice in the past and all of them I just exchanged after a few years because of a newer/cooler model
354	neg	My old Proteus Core worked for 3 years without issues until I replaced it
354	neg	Same with the Logitech iFeel Optical (bought that 2 decades ago and never failed on me)
354	neg	It is a real shame that Logitech clearly decided to ignore the issue plaguing this mouse
354	neg	I like the ergonomics and the features (I really like mice with "sniper" buttons), but if the mouse doesn't last 6-12 months its just not worth
354	neg	Logitech did replace the mouse, but it started having issues as well after 8-12 months
354	neg	Same thing with the Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum
354	neg	Loved that headset (Battlefield 1/V sounds amazing
354	neg	Love the directional/positional audio) but it is plagued with issues as well
354	neg	I really hope Logitech steps up their game for future products
354	neg	They need to build things to last like they used to do a few years ago
355	pos	I've owned Logitech products for years and have always been very happy
355	pos	This mouse is no exception
355	pos	All in all it's a great mouse, built well, look good
355	pos	However there are a few things I want to point out
355	pos	First the mouse wheel is metal with no rubber "Grip" like my last 2 mice
355	pos	This makes scrolling the wheel a bit uncomfortable and it FEELS like it's imprecise
355	pos	The second thing is based on a comparison to my old Logitech MX  Master which was a  bit larger with a better surface for resting your hand
355	pos	With the MX your hand could simply rest on the mouse, supporting it almost entirely with little effort
355	pos	With the G502 it's narrower and more "humped" so that I am forced to GRIP it the whole time and after just a bit my hand gets sore and cramped
356	pos	Another great gaming mouse from Logitech
356	pos	Light, good amount of buttons and a temporary DPI change button
356	pos	Very responsive, and a good amount of cord
356	pos	Once connected and with G Hub installed, you can customize and change the mouse G color as you want
356	pos	Tracks fine so matter the DPI
356	pos	G Hub has gotten better and makes it easy to fine tune the mouse
356	pos	Bottom pops off easily if you want to add weights
357	pos	I had been using a g500 for almost 10 years
357	pos	I loved that mouse as someone who uses a full palm grip and has larger hands
357	pos	When the buttons finally started to give me the double click failure I looked around for a solid replacement
357	pos	I was recommended the g502 from multiple people and read about it as a replacement on multiple sites
357	pos	I pulled the trigger and grabbed one because my other mouse was not really functional anymore
357	pos	The mouse does good clicky things, all the buttons feel solid and the mouse is responsive
357	pos	The thumb rest is great well positioned, but the mouse is too narrow overall for a good palm grip
357	pos	I also use a write pad with my mouse and so the sharp falloff combined with the narrow body mean that only half my palm is actually on the mouse
357	pos	I either have to scrunch my hand up to keep my hand off the pad or drag part of my hand around
357	pos	I think this mouse is probably an amazing mouse with someone with smaller hands, or someone who prefers a claw grip
357	pos	However, if you got some wide hands like I do and use a full palm grip you might want to keep looking
358	pos	Solid mouse for any gamer, very accurate and easily customizable
358	pos	Works amazing with my Xbox One and my PC
358	pos	Software is very intuitive and great to use
358	pos	Buttons are easily programmable and useful for games where having immediate access to a command is crucial
358	pos	Would recommend 100%
358	pos	To address “used” mouse deliveries, this mouse came in brand new packaging, mouse looked like it was sent straight from the factory although weights were not really clean (manufacturing and packaging processes usually make it look this way) but felt brand new so i wouldn’t hesitate purchasing this as it is a great buy
358	pos	For those thinking your scroll wheel is broken if it spins freely, theres a button that you can press and it switches it to free spin mode or normal mode so don’t fix it if it ain't broke
358	pos	Only problem is getting off your PC after :)
358	pos	One of my favorite mice of all time
359	neg	I had the previous version of this mouse which I loved, so when it finally died after years of use I figured this was the next logical step
359	neg	Sadly I can't say the purchase experience has been all that great for me
359	neg	While I still love the features this mouse provides it didn't even last a year
359	neg	Within 6 yo 8 months it began experiencing a stutter on the right mouse button which spread to the left as well
359	neg	Looking online it's a pretty widely known issue, which they even put out a firmware update to attempt to fix
359	neg	When that didn't help I contacted customer support to potentially get a replacement, they were, to my surprise, absolutely no help
359	neg	They instructed me to clean the mouse and provided a link to a webpage that would count "rapid double clicks" and requested that I get video footage testing the mouse
359	neg	However the webpage doesn't pick any unusual behavior up, but the mouse displays the same behavior across multiple games
359	neg	So long story short I'm stuck with a sort of reliable mouse
359	neg	Needless to say I'm likely to buy another mouse but I'm not so sure it'll be another Logitech at this point
360	pos	I would love to give this mouse a 5, but there’s just a couple small things
360	pos	It is just a tad too small, but then I have relatively big hands, so if it doesn’t fit like a glove that’s okay
360	pos	The rest of the mouse could be a little more metal, as most of it is plastic
360	pos	Over all I recommend this, it’s a very nice clicky mouse wheel, so swapping to the desired secondary/ primary/ heavy on destiny is easy
360	pos	If your hands are longer than 9
360	pos	5” from thumb to pinky spread out, if look for something else
361	pos	Let me start this of by saying oh my the buttons
361	pos	Coming from a simple left/right scroll mouse this was a shock to me especially relating to how I hold this mouse
361	pos	With the ridiculous amount of toggles you are met with an endless array of control mapping as long as the program/game registers those as applicable binds
361	pos	(some do not unfortunately and will register that button to a key on your keyboard as well overwriting it’s original bind) The mouse itself is quite hearty but has a solid feel to it and features the endless scroll function on the mouse wheel
361	pos	Also the sensor is wonderful and can be adjusted up to 16000 dpi which no ordinary human would need
361	pos	One flaw I would like to point out would be the feet on this mouse
361	pos	They really hold the whole 502 hero package back feeling cheap and overall lacking quality commonly found on mice within the “gaming” genre of peripherals
361	pos	If you have larger hands and like the feeling of a hefty mouse this is a valid contender as I’ve come to enjoy using it very much
362	pos	I am the office monkey
362	pos	I thought it will be cool to use a mouse my 17 year old nephew suggested, but I forgot my age
362	pos	In the haste of being a new age nerd, I bought a heavy mouse meant for gamers with cool leds
362	pos	Never understood the need for LEDs
362	pos	It’s a smooth mouse and heavy heavy one (not like of your dumbbells 😀 though)
362	pos	I love it
362	pos	It wakes up my Mac mini whenever I want and moves smoothly across the display
362	pos	So in summary, a great mouse for a gamer and a very good one for everyone else
363	pos	I bought this as it was recommended for people with larger hands in a number of reviews, but it is definitely made for smaller hands
363	pos	My hands are not really that big, but my thumb doesn't even fit into the thumb groove
363	pos	Using this, I'd have to switch from a palm grip to a finger grip, so I'll keep looking
363	pos	Also, when you set the mouse wheel to "click" mode, it really is difficult to scroll the wheel up
363	pos	Down works fine, but my finger just slips over the wheel when scrolling up
364	pos	I am becoming a big fan of logitech this mouse looks Fresh feels fresh is everything you'd expect I hear the pros gamers dont use these types for FPS games but I'm having no issues owning call of duty lobbiesI have long fingers and I use a claw grip I'm very satisfied
364	pos	I also use this often why playing Xbox one with my pc friends on cod modern warfare
364	pos	My only complaint could be a positive for a lot of people is that there is a DPI switch directly along the main right click button drives me crazy but I think I'm getting used to it
365	neg	I can concur with other reviewers that this mouse over time develops left click issues
365	neg	Namely in my case dragging windows is a point of endless frustration as this mouse constantly drops the window
365	neg	Double clicks have been noticed as well
365	neg	I really really liked this mouse and when the first one went bad after about a year of use, I thought I might of just been unlucky, and bought a second one
365	neg	Lo and behold here I am a year later wishing I'd just bought a different Mouse
365	neg	I've been using Logitech mouses for 15+ years and these two mice are the only ones I have had an issue with
365	neg	They won't get me a third time
366	pos	This mouse is extremely well made
366	pos	I quite like using it
366	pos	I currently use this mouse with a Xim Apex on my Xbox One X
366	pos	It is highly customizable and it feels great in your hand
366	pos	The texture on it is excellent
366	pos	It fits in my average sized hands perfectly
366	pos	I can click all the buttons with ease
366	pos	It is a bit on the heavy side; however, this is not a bother to me
366	pos	It's still light enough to turn on some bots
366	pos	The software for this mouse really is not that bad either
366	pos	I see a lot of other people complaining about it
366	pos	It's easy to navigate and customize the mouse
366	pos	I am not sure what their issues with the software is
366	pos	All in all, I love this mouse for gaming
367	neg	It is way too complicated for the various modes- I am still trying to figure out the DPI modes, and then the left click starts failing
367	neg	Won't hold fire, won't fire 100% first click
367	neg	So I tested it by drag selecting text and clicking to place the curser in the middle of text, same crap my Corsair started doing after a year
367	neg	So I know I have been gaming like crazy due to this covid crap, but for $50 I expect a gazillion clicks
367	neg	Could do without umpteen levels of DPI variation- the Corsair was much, much easier to use
367	neg	Going through Logitech warranty now
368	pos	Been a Logitech mouse owner since the mouseman optical in 2002 playing Battlefield 1942
368	pos	Since then I've have the 510, the 510, MX, MXLazer, G5, G7, then I gave up on Logitech for a bit because they changed the familiar feel and shape of the mice I loved
368	pos	Then these came up and I gave one a go
368	pos	That was it, welcome back to my gaming setup and everyone I know's setup too
368	pos	These mice are the perfect shape, rgb, weights
368	pos	what's not to love
368	pos	They last too
368	pos	It's hard to sell a new mouse to someone that never gets rid of one that works, but I'm totally satisfied and bought a second for a backup just in case
368	pos	And my new kitten approves
369	neg	Terrible, I will never get another one
369	neg	It stopped working after 3 weeks
369	neg	I tried all of the troubleshooting tips, (e
369	neg	g
369	neg	rebooting, delete driver, re-install driver, move to different USB port)
369	neg	I put my old razor mouse back in and it works fine
369	neg	So no more Logitech garbage for me
369	neg	I am very pleased that Amazon did refund my money though
369	neg	So kudos to Amazon for the refund
370	pos	Cant say much about this mouse in detail, as I’m not too keen on this like mouse accuracy, DPI, and other things, but if I could guess, I’d say this mouse does those things perfectly fine
370	pos	It has such a massive DPI range for anyone looking to fine tweak it, a G Huh app that can reassign buttons and functions and even change the backlight on your mouse
370	pos	It’s a very stacked mouse, especially when you consider all that you’re getting, people hate the whole wired niche but, I hate having to find new batteries so there’s that lol
370	pos	The build quality and weight is truly what makes this feel like no other
370	pos	It is
370	pos	SO
370	pos	premium, to me
370	pos	It has this metallic feel or maybe plastic, but GOOD plastic and it really feels like what upgrading from a Dualshock 4 to a Dualsense is (if you’re a playstation gamer, you know exactly what I mean) The build quality is an enigma and makes playing in this thing for hours a breeze, truly feels ergonomic
371	pos	The mouse is good, but breaks after a few months
371	pos	If it does break, the hoops Logitech customer service wants you to jump through are ridiculous
371	pos	I have returned enough computer parts for failure and have never had to jump through this many hoops, which include trouble-shooting the mouse yourself (everything from using an air compressor  to uploading new firmware, and more)
371	pos	They also wanted a video of the mouse acting up
371	pos	I have a 4-year warranty and may wait until the factory warranty period is over when it's easier to return
372	neg	please know that I am not sure if this issue is common, I purchased this mouse for my young cousin to play on his computer for Christmas
372	neg	to our surprise he keeps complaining that the left button does not work properly and that it makes a really weird noise
372	neg	I tried to help him and see if I could fix the issue as it is obvious and unfortunately we cant
372	neg	this is unacceptable as this was what my little cousin wanted for his Christmas gift
372	neg	truly feel taken advantage off
373	pos	I have to admit, the fact that there are so many buttons on this mouse made it seem incredibly dumb
373	pos	When would I ever use all of these buttons
373	pos	Well, I still don't but they're not why I like this mouse
373	pos	The scroll wheel is honestly a life changer
373	pos	There's one button on the mouse that changes how the scroll wheel works, switching between normal scrolling and infinite scrolling
373	pos	The latter is definitely beneficial for someone like me who looks at too many spreadsheets every day
373	pos	10/10 product, the size and shape are great and don't feel cheap and my god that scroll wheel
374	pos	its definitely a great buy considering how long my electronics usually last, iv had corsair, razer, roccat, and hyperx
374	pos	I'm no stranger to Logitech considering iv been buying their products for a long time
374	pos	With this mouse iv finished my set of full Logitech peripherals
374	pos	great settings to fit my reactive gaming needs as well as matching aesthetic to my keyboard
374	pos	definitely worth the money
375	neg	This is my second G502 hero
375	neg	The first one lasted almost 2 years
375	neg	I thought maybe I had wore the clicker out
375	neg	or I use it on my laptop and I travel often and it had got damaged on a trip while packing it up
375	neg	So I bought a new one
375	neg	This new one has never left my desk is under a month old up to date on updates tried it on a different computer and can not get it to stop left clicking
375	neg	It is the exact same problem I had with the first g502 hero
375	neg	Will not be getting another one glad it happened before my month was up
376	pos	I was skeptical at first, coming from a Steel Series Rival 600 to this G502
376	pos	But I was shocked to find how comfortable it feels in my hand
376	pos	The weights too are a great feature and easy to install compared to the Rival 600
376	pos	Only thing I would of liked Logitech to change is to have the Logitech hub install when I plug the mouse in
376	pos	It also feels like it doesn't slide well on my mouse pad but I think it is due to being slightly dirty from spilled Redbull LOL
376	pos	This is definitely a good mouse, feels very clean when aiming and very comfy
377	neg	CON # 1: The shape of the this is unusual
377	neg	I do not recommend this mouse if you rest your wrist on a wrist pad because it lifts your palm a little off of the mouse
377	neg	The main point of stable contact on this mouse seems to be the palm
377	neg	The mouse is too narrow to hold the mouse between your thumb and ring and pink fingers
377	neg	Without a wrist pad raising up your wrist this mouse will work okay
377	neg	CON # 2: The scroll wheel is a very smooth metal surface
377	neg	You have to apply a little extra pressure or your finger will just slide on top of the scroll wheel without turning it
377	neg	Logitech's marathon mouse has a nice rubber grip on the scroll wheel; not sure why they didn't use the same here
377	neg	I need a mouse with the free scrolling feature that only some Logitech and Amazon Basics mouses have at this time, but this mouse needs some design fixes in my opinion
378	pos	Love logitech products
378	pos	They're usually top quality and work very well
378	pos	This is a good looking mouse, top quality and works very well
378	pos	The issue I have is that it's heavy
378	pos	Can't imagine anybody Adding additional weight to it
378	pos	If there was a rest for the pinky it can handle additional weight but as is it doesn't
378	pos	The additional weight comes into play when making fine movements with just the fingers
378	pos	Using the mouse using the whole wrist is no problem but split second few pixel adjustment is difficult
378	pos	If this is the only mouse I'm sure people will adjust to it but those who own Mambas, ROGs, wireless charging pad mouse or any other high dollar, very low weight tournament grade mouse will find this mouse too heavy
379	neg	purchased 3/14/2020
379	neg	start noticing left click/drag tends to double click after about 2 months use
379	neg	today is 6/4/2020, problem is more persistent, pretty much will not drag/click hold on left mouse click
379	neg	running latest driver, using Logitech G Hub with profile, mouse cleaned so no dust/derbies inside
379	neg	Decided to google this problem and did what i could based on all reddit/forum advises and nothing helps
379	neg	But one thing is consistent, this problem is a common issue with this mouse and support is minimal from logitech, i have a ticket put in now through their site as they note a "2-year limited hardware warranty" for this product as of 6/3/2020
379	neg	According to some people this issue is due to a "switch" that needs to be replaced/soldered, but if you do this you will void all warranty
379	neg	Just google the problem yourself and decide if this is the right mouse for you
379	neg	I really should've stuck w the razer deathadder instead of trying this out
379	neg	****UPDATE 2/15/2021:currently on my FOURTH replacement from Logitech
379	neg	left click failed on all 3 after about 3-4 month of normal usage, no heavy gaming done
379	neg	essentially, if you click and hold on a double click site that logitech provides for mouse tests for when you report a mouse issue to them, the click counter will keep rising
379	neg	Left click does NOT hold after a few month of usage
379	neg	while my friend recommended this mouse to me and has not had an issue, I'm currently on my FOURTH logitech hero as of yesterday
379	neg	replacement takes 3-4 weeks time and it is tedious
379	neg	I do not recommend and cannot recommend people getting this mouse as this product is EXTREMELY unreliable
380	neg	I do enjoy this mouse, how ever the first one I received the left mouse button wasn't functioning at all
380	neg	Got another one rather quickly
380	neg	This one was great, it did everything I wanted it to and even the extra buttons to setup proper profiles was perfect
380	neg	Now six months after my left mouse button is acting up and likes to unclick it self
380	neg	I really do like this mouse but this is becoming such a headache
380	neg	Update-6/1/21Third mouse I've now received and I got 8 months out of this one instead of the usual six months
380	neg	Now it's an unclicking issue when you hold M1(left mouse button) instead of a double click
381	neg	Purchased this back in March 2020 to replace my about 10 year old Logitech MX518
381	neg	I really did love this mouse at first, the feel, the responsiveness, programable buttons and RGB pairing with the G Pro Keyboard was a nice additional touch
381	neg	I've used the mouse for MMO's and first person shooters alike and loved the performance in both
381	neg	Then came the dreaded click problems, first being noticeable with my right click not sticking when being held down and only registering a single click
381	neg	Second problem came with the left click not registering or semi registering when pairing with the right click, which made this unusable in any FPS game
381	neg	Really disappointed Logitech hasn't addressed this problem and is choosing to ignore it until next product cycle
381	neg	I've been a Logitech peripherals diehard for years, this will be the mouse that ends that
381	neg	I don't want to RMA a mouse every few months to year because the basic feature of clicking stops working
382	pos	It's a real shame, I love this mouse, personally it fits perfectly in my hand and I love the way it feels but after about 6 months of use, the right mouse button started double clicking
382	pos	It was only occasional at first, and sometimes would stop doing it if I clicked the mouse button in a different way, but over the past few weeks it's getting worse and worse
382	pos	I play a fair bit of Rainbow 6 Siege and it's so frustrating to go around a corner to aim at someone's head, only for it to randomly stop aiming and re-aiming sporadically
382	pos	In just this past week now my left mouse button is starting to become unusable, for example I could be using a fully auto weapon and click left mouse button to shoot, only for it to shoot one bullet
382	pos	Even more frustrating is I can't even drag my browsers from one monitor to the other because it just doesn't detect that I'm holding the mouse button down, it acts like I'm only clicking it
382	pos	It just sucks cause I love the way the mouse feels so much but it's just becoming so unusable
383	neg	I'd been a fan of Logitech mice for a long time but these new 500 series are pure garbage
383	neg	I have a 305 and a 402 logitech that I still use on other PCs but I decided I needed a new mouse for my new gaming PC
383	neg	So I bought the 502g despite seeing a lot of flak online for these being basically bricks after a short time of use
383	neg	I trusted that even if the 502g had issues certainly revisions had fixed the issues with double clicking and left click failure that many had reported before
383	neg	It took a mere 3 months of light use on my gaming mouse to become nearly unusable
383	neg	Which I'm sure to an average gamer would be a month or less
383	neg	Don't buy it, you will regret it
383	neg	Listen to the naysayers, the product is just of a purely inferior quality
383	neg	I could have got a cheaper mouse that I know would have been reliable and served my needs but I spurlged because of my respect for Logitech quality and I was let down
383	neg	I will be much more critical of my purchases of logitech mice in the future which sucks because I never even had to think much about it before
384	pos	I like it a lot
384	pos	Ergonomic, easy clicks, scrolls, size, customizable buttons with working software
384	pos	I didn't buy for gaming, only to use for home and work
384	pos	The only drawback is the scroll - it's too loose like what other reviewers said
384	pos	You apply a little force and it scrolls on and on by itself - needs to be tightened a little
384	pos	I'd prefer loose than too tight but still needs tightened a little
385	pos	I’d assumed this would be be similar to my trusty old g602 that finally went to mouse heaven, but it is substantially smaller and lacks the ergonomics of its older brother
385	pos	I trued to make this work for a few months to see if I’d adjust, but I finally caved and bought another 602
385	pos	The quality seems great and the mouse is sleek and responsive
385	pos	It just hurts to use after a long session and my response time was definitely suffering
386	pos	I received an used G502 today and have to say this is the first time this happened to me
386	pos	Please check those pics:It may not that clear to see the linear scratches but it's obvious that the bottom rubber part was peeled off
386	pos	I doubt it was not re-packed well since they were not at the same place when I opened the box
386	pos	I tried my best to shoot those scratches, they are easier to be noticed on real
386	pos	They sent me another replacement even before I return this old one back
386	pos	So I gave 2 more stars for this item
386	pos	I will return the used one back once I received new replacement and make sure it's new
387	pos	Ultimately, I'm very satisfied with this mouse
387	pos	My number one complaint is that the scroll wheel isn't rubberized and is metal, so my fingertip tends to slide on it too easily (especially on cold/dry days)
387	pos	However, I looooove the de-click button
387	pos	That almost makes up for the slippery wheel
387	pos	Ergonomically, it's so-so
387	pos	Feels a little small in my hand and slightly awkward
387	pos	I tend to accidentally click the precision buttons when trying to click primary
387	pos	But all-in-all I'm pretty pleased with it
388	neg	I have used this mouse for about 7 months almost every day for work purposes and/or gaming before it broke down
388	neg	Just like a lot of people have mentioned, it will ultimately result in double click issues (very common)
388	neg	This is when you click left or right button and it registers more than once
388	neg	For example, I may want to highlight something, but while I am holding down the left button, it will register a click again, making it lose the highlight before and highlighting a new one from that instance
388	neg	In addition, this mouse is more suitable for those who do a full grip and have larger hands
388	neg	It is slightly heavier than a normal mouse
388	neg	Regardless, this mouse is great in features such as weight adjustment with several mouse buttons
388	neg	Something to note is that even with all the weights adjustment off, it is still heavier than some of the smaller logitech mouse
388	neg	It is a great mouse, only if you want to buy a new one every year or so
388	neg	It does have a two year warranty, so I am waiting on that
388	neg	Make sure NOT to buy from a 3rd party seller in order to receive the warranty
389	pos	are you right handed
389	pos	do you only need a few buttons on your mouse
389	pos	if yes, this is a great choice for gaming or other usage as well
389	pos	very comfortable for my claw grip
389	pos	the weights let you get exactly the feel you want
389	pos	the sensor is very sensitive and responsive
389	pos	i recommend to use the manufacturer's software utility to set the mouse to hardware memory mode and save your preferred settings there
390	pos	I purchased this after my G700 and it's wired counterpart gave out and I'm pretty disappointed
390	pos	The mouse is on the small side for a gaming mouse
390	pos	With all the weights installed the weight it's OK
390	pos	The scroll wheel has the $10 mouse notchy feel, so bad I'm just using free mode something I never do
390	pos	The button placement is pretty good
390	pos	Even with the lighting off it draws too much power to run off the USB hub in my keyboard, so it needs a powered hub or plugged directly into the PC
390	pos	I will put it this way, I just ordered the parts to rebuild my older gaming mice, just a left mouse button failure on both
390	pos	This will become a backup mouse
391	pos	I love this mouse
391	pos	I doubt that it is for everyone but I purchased two of them
391	pos	One for home, and one for the office
391	pos	This mouse comes with weights and the bottom comes off so you can add them to your liking
391	pos	I only added 2 weights but I could easily see someone else not wanting to add any at all
391	pos	I like a fast mouse but I find that when I have a light-weight mouse it makes it a bit more difficult to be accurate when pointing
391	pos	I didn't expect to like it as much as I do but after using it at home for months I had to get one to use at work because a standard office mouse just isn't cutting it
391	pos	The scroll wheel can be unlocked and can spin freely
391	pos	This is great for scrolling all the way down on a PDF or just getting to the bottom of a page on a website
391	pos	Its far from the most premium feeling mouse but I have to say its definitely not cheap feeling
392	pos	I now own 2 of these and they are without a doubt the best mouse I've ever had
392	pos	The first one I bought is still working nearly 3/4 years later
392	pos	It does have some click issues here and there, but I did travel with it for a couple years without a case
392	pos	New one is just as good
392	pos	Adjustable weight is super dope too
392	pos	This thing goes on sale frequently for like $30 can't beat that buy for the quality
392	pos	1000% recommend
393	pos	I got this mouse and like, it has a METAL SCROLL WHEEL
393	pos	And it feels nice
393	pos	And there's a button to lock or unlock free spin mode
393	pos	Then it has this cool thumb button for changing the DPI to a preset
393	pos	It's a "sniper" button, and if you hold it, and it is set up for a lower DPI preset, you can use it to help aim better when using sniper rifles in games
393	pos	The DPI up, down, and sniper buttons can all be reconfigured anyway if you don't need DPI adjustments
393	pos	And I would not say that any of the buttons are particularly 'in the way'
393	pos	It's a full-sized mouse and good for those with large hands or larger fingers
393	pos	Also the scroll wheel has a left/right tilting click for horizontal scrolling, which you can also remap
394	neg	DO NOT BOTHER WITH LOGITECH WARRANTY
394	neg	They will make you jump through several hoops to "prove" the product is broken then will tell to piss off because "a replacement is not available at this time"
394	neg	I've never been so insulted by a company this much
394	neg	Looks like a really common issue is that the middle mouse button "click" will just break after a month or two of use
394	neg	Kind of an important function when you're gaming
394	neg	EDIT: Tried to get this repaired through Logitech warranty/support and they have been absolutely godawful
394	neg	DO NOT BUY FROM LOGITECH
395	pos	This mouse has weights for you to customize how heavy you would like it
395	pos	There are also customizable buttons for you to program
395	pos	Gaming with this mouse is very smooth and my hand doesn't typically get tired
395	pos	I have small hands (f) so I would prefer the mouse to be a little smaller, but for an average person - and male - this fits great
395	pos	I like that this version is a corded version because I don't need to worry about my mouse dying, but if you prefer wireless this mouse has that option as well
396	pos	Not a fan of Razer mice, or any of their gaming products
396	pos	(I like the Razer phone II)  So I may be biased
396	pos	Hated the Corsair mouse I tried
396	pos	Not sure about the weights, I feel like a good gamer adapts to the gear they have but it has to work, be precise, reliable, durable and feel right
396	pos	Fit and feel, just like a good hand gun
396	pos	Took a day to adjust I think
396	pos	Picked up a second for the office
397	pos	The only thing I can complain about is how the gaming profiles work on this mouse
397	pos	When you only set one profile and disable the other ones, if you press the G9 button (default for switching profiles) nothing should change since there aren't any other profiles but the DPI leds brightness do change to the default value regardless of what brightness level you had before
397	pos	It fixes itself once you open the software and click on the led color tab
397	pos	For this situation happening every time I pressed the G9 button by mistake, I disabled the G9 function and left it blank
398	pos	The scroll wheel placement is about 1
398	pos	5 inches away from the edge of the mouse so my middle finger needs to be bent at all times to utilize it which is actually uncomfortable
398	pos	There isn't enough resistance on the wheel it self and its hard to tell how many tics you go through while scrolling even by feel or sound, this makes it less then ideal for gaming if its hot keyed and this is a gaming mouse
398	pos	and to push the scroll wheel down for an additional hotkey function, it doesn't plunge downward enough for my liking
398	pos	I would not recommend using this as a gaming mouse but it would be decent at best for everyday use
398	pos	If you have large to xl hands this is not for you
399	neg	This mouse is way way to complicated to use and frankly don't have the time nor do I want to spend the time deciphering how to use this damn thing
399	neg	The buttons are all too close together so when you are playing anything you will be sure to change the DPI mid game and lose it
399	neg	The sell this as a gaming mouse yet you cant play anything more than 5 minutes without accidently changing the DPI setting to some ridiculous speed
399	neg	Tried downloading and installing the software and it fails too
399	neg	Just trash
399	neg	I wish product designers would realize that people do not live in your world and look at these things all day long
399	neg	Don't expect people to just know how to use a product that is so complicated and has a horrible user manual
399	neg	I pay good money for a premium product I cant even enjoy because it takes a college course to learn how to use
400	pos	I was rocking a madcatz R
400	pos	A
400	pos	T 7 forever, till my cat got the mouse
400	pos	literally
400	pos	Chewed through the cable and I’m pretty sure the don’t make those mice anymore
400	pos	So I opted for the Logitech, it’s a great mouse, almost similar to my old one but different button layout
400	pos	So I’m still getting used to it here about 2 months later
400	pos	But it’s a great mouse, I love the free spin selection on the mouse wheel
400	pos	That thing spins forever and a day
400	pos	Anyways, it’s a great gaming mouse
400	pos	I use it in Dayz all the time as well as elite dangerous
401	neg	I have had this mouse for 6 months and for the first 4ish months it was a great mouse
401	neg	I love the buttons and that it fits my hand great (which is hard because I have smaller hands) but about 2 months ago the left click started acting up
401	neg	I can't highlight text or move windows, I try to close one internet window and end up closing multiples all because no matter how lightly or quickly I push the left click it ALWAYS double clicks
401	neg	This mouse should have lasted a hell of a lot longer than 6 months, specially with how much it costs
401	neg	I'll be going out today to buy a new one and will definitely avoid getting another Logitech
402	pos	While I was getting a list of keyboards from the very helpful Logitech people, I asked about programmable mice
402	pos	They recommended the G502 Hero and the G502 Lightspeed
402	pos	I went with the G502 Hero
402	pos	I am not sorry that I did
402	pos	It is a very nice mouse
402	pos	The only thing I am still not sure about is if I should have gone with the wireless Lightspeed model
402	pos	That is the difference between the two mice
402	pos	I have the corded model
402	pos	I wanted to avoid any connection problems
402	pos	So, this mouse is well made and nice to hold
402	pos	The buttons are placed well for average hands
402	pos	I cant fault them for my hands, as I have unusually large hands and fingers (my ring sizes are in the 20's and 30's)
402	pos	I am used to having this problem with all mice however
402	pos	It is one reason I like the trackpad, but trackpad's are not good for gaming
402	pos	I really must say how much I like the G Hub software, it really works well with MacOS, knock on wood
402	pos	Let's hope it continues to do so
402	pos	They really have the competition beat by miles, it just works so smoothly with MacOS
402	pos	Oh yes
402	pos	The weights
402	pos	I thought these were just a gimmick when I read about them
402	pos	I stand corrected, they completely change the feel of the mouse
402	pos	I have decided I like all the weights loaded, it has a good solid feel that way
402	pos	Highly recommended
403	pos	the value you can get from it is great
403	pos	unfortunately most of the buttons aren't recognizeable by the pc, you have to give most of the mouse buttons a input while use, my advice is using the numpad keys
403	pos	the mouse is not Ergonomic build well, if you have meduim to large hands two of your fingers would be on the pad/table or in the air by force it
403	pos	in the pictures that looks a wide mouse but it was built like that you can't fit your whole hand with it
403	pos	a bit disapointing, but still overall good with my purchase on sale for that mouse, mostly because of the features and quality built
404	pos	Not for large hands
404	pos	Way too many accidental right clicks when side to side aiming
404	pos	even just web browsing on ytube
404	pos	Logitech g602 with the thumb wing for life
404	pos	This is a great mouse, but il be tossing it in the drawer
404	pos	I added all the weights, but I'm still too jittery and jerky with aiming when compared to the g602
404	pos	The weight of my fingers is enough to depress right click
404	pos	Look somewhere else unless it's for a kid
405	neg	The product page advertises 25,000 DPI but the product delivered clearly says it only gets up to 16,000 DPI
405	neg	I’ll update my review after a few months of use but the 2 star review will stay until then for false advertising
405	neg	I saw what looked like the same mouse at Target at the same price but because of the drastic difference in DPI I assumed it must have been an earlier model and ordered and waited for this product to arrive instead
405	neg	Slimy business practice
405	neg	I’m pretty disappointed
406	pos	It's of course a great gaming mouse and it's hard to go wrong with this mouse
406	pos	The ergonomics are almost perfect for my hand
406	pos	The only issue holding it back from a 5 star review is material quality
406	pos	Compared to my old mouse it feels cheap
406	pos	Granted it is about 15 bucks cheaper but still I would have liked to see better quality
406	pos	It also doesn't slide as smoothly on my mouse pad and it has thrown me off to a small degree
406	pos	Just my subjective opinion though
406	pos	I'm also not a big fan of the software
407	neg	In total it had been a great mouse for the price
407	neg	But the reason this is a low star review is because the when the mouse feet on my unit came off and the sensor started randomly flicking upward
407	neg	I emailed Logitech about this back and forth waiting days at a time for each responce they sent, continuously kept asking for more details after I had explained everything
407	neg	Also I called the support number and waited for hours at a time for no one to answer
407	neg	In total this was a waste of the money I spent on it, and I cant even take advantage of my warranty
408	pos	I got this mouse because it was recommended for large hands
408	pos	It's too small for my borderline medium to large hands
408	pos	The claw grip looks comical and the palm grip puts my thumb on the sniper button
408	pos	For me, there is simply no good way to hold it and have decent control
408	pos	I gave it 4 stars because it's of a high build quality and the sensor tracks great
408	pos	I won't be able to use it because of the size and I don't recommend anyone with large size or bigger hands to get this mouse
409	pos	I had just entered the PC world and was playing on a basic Logitech mouse
409	pos	Didn't take long to realize I needed to upgrade
409	pos	Overall,l this is a very solid step up
409	pos	From the numerous customizable buttons, weight variation, and RGB lighting, your mouse will look good, feel good, and play good
409	pos	For my personal playing style, the weight adjustment is the best feature
409	pos	Some like a lighter mouse but I like mine a little heavier
409	pos	The weights under the mouse made making the adjustment to my liking quite seamless
409	pos	The RGB lighting is not the best
409	pos	There are plenty of mouse options that offer cooler-looking light functions, but for something that is just cosmetic, it was not a deal-breaker
409	pos	Overall, the RGB is no bad at all, it's just not great
409	pos	I give this mouse a solid 9 out of 10
409	pos	I would have liked the weights to be just a little heavier, and the RGB to be more intriguing but for the simple task of gaming, the mouse is great
410	pos	I had a Razer Naga that had a good life, but after about 10 years, it was having some issues
410	pos	Before I had that mouse, I recall the Logitech I had and loved the scroll feature it had
410	pos	A friend of mine said that it was the best mouse for playing Spore due to going from planetary to galactic in an instant
410	pos	Now that I’m back in school and using digital books, I felt the need for that scroll wheel
410	pos	I still wanted extra buttons, but realized I didn’t need the num-pad on my thumb
410	pos	This mouse checked all those boxes, and for a good price
410	pos	Additionally, there is a button on the mouse that lets you switch how the scroll works, which is nice at time
411	neg	I’ve owned multiple gaming mouses from different brands, and I’ve never felt so uncomfortable using this mouse
411	neg	The scroll wheel doesn’t feel accurate/natural
411	neg	There are two buttons on the left mouse button, while this could be super convenient for someone that needs them, I don’t
411	neg	I feel like there is very little wiggle room for my finger and it’s too easy to misclick things
411	neg	I’ve tried to use it for a week or so and get used to it, but this mouse just not feel natural to use for me
412	neg	The mouse worked fine for approximately one month before it suddenly stopped functioning
412	neg	I tried different computers and settings, all to no avail
412	neg	I contacted Logitech support and they asked me to change a number of settings on my computer, none of which worked
412	neg	The mouse was dead
412	neg	I was asked to send a photo of the serial number and mouse, etc
412	neg	to them
412	neg	Several days passed and I was sent a response from a different customer support person basically telling me to repeat the steps and again send in the photos
412	neg	One week later, same thing, different person
412	neg	Back and forth emails were getting nowhere
412	neg	Finally, another person said that the warranty replacement was being processed and I would hear back from them within 72 hours
412	neg	That was one month ago
412	neg	As you can see, “customer support” is code for stalling until the customer gets fed up and stops trying
412	neg	Kudos to Erma M
412	neg	, Mel C
412	neg	, Rhon Garcia in customer support for their attempt to save Logitech a couple of bucks at the expense of customer satisfaction
412	neg	My family has used multiple Logitech mice in the past
412	neg	Good luck with that now
413	neg	So i recommend to any user that reads a happy 4/5 star review of this mouse, either is by a user who doesn't play games or reviewed the mouse to early
413	neg	This mouse has double click issues within less than 1 year time frame typically
413	neg	The switch is poor quality
413	neg	i highly recommend looking into a the new viper optic switch though the mouse material looks like crap
413	neg	Anyway other comments, when i tried to RMA this product if that's what your thinking you'll do when this fails
413	neg	well they might do it for u after you take a full spread video of u clicking the mouse on this stupid html page for double click issues
413	neg	Personally i'm not going to do that when u look at several reviews of this product and every user out there that has this mouse for any time has terrible issues with this product
413	neg	Material/shape of mouse and weight options are good
413	neg	overall colors and coolness factor great, drivers were meh
413	neg	Logtiech click quality is the problem with this mouse
413	neg	I've had my wireless MX series for 3 years still don't have this issue
413	neg	Anyway good luck if u decide to buy and actually regularly game
414	pos	Luego de que se descomponga un G700s (funcionó desde el 2013-2020) he pasado por muchos, pero muchos experimentos
414	pos	marcas y modelos, de palma, de garra, con peso y sin el
414	pos	hasta que finalmente dí con éste modelo, que el tiempo me dirá si es igualmente duradero como el modelo reemplazado
414	pos	Es ergonómico y cómodo
414	pos	Me ha gustado tanto la ergonomía que he comprado otro para tenerlo de reserva en el caso que se deje de fabricar
415	pos	I originally bought one of these back in 2014-2015, when it had no RGB, only a single blue light, and the blue strip on the bottom left where your thumb rests
415	pos	Had it under warranty through Microcenter and switched it out for the Spectrum edition, with the RGB around 2016-2017
415	pos	Recently bought this Hero back in February of this year, just in case
415	pos	Glad I did, since it seems my older one is starting to develop a double-click on the right click
415	pos	Since using the new one now, I can definitely tell the old one had more wear and tear obviously, with a more loose scroll wheel
415	pos	But wow, a mouse you pay 50-60 USD for that lasts you that long
415	pos	I'll never use any other mouse honestly
415	pos	The scroll wheel feature alone is hands down what makes this mouse better than any other mouse
415	pos	Every other good feature, the sensor, the 4 profiles, on-board memory, good cable, etc are just bonuses stacked on top of each other
416	neg	I bought this mouse to replace a $15 chinese mouse that worked perfectly for 3 years
416	neg	In less than 3 months I started having problems with the left mouse button randomly double clicking and not being able to click something and drag it without dropping it
416	neg	5 minutes of research on the internet and I find that many are having the same problem because they got faulty switches and used them anyway, selling them 50% off to lure people into the trap
416	neg	This product was a horrible purchase, and has eroded many years of trust I had in Logitech products
417	neg	They look great, they feel great and I have no complaints on how they respond when they work
417	neg	But every single one of them breaks after 6-10 months and all have the same problem
417	neg	The left-click either double-clicks or just acts as you depresses the button (you can notice this during drag-and-drops, when the click is released half-way)
417	neg	This is the last Logitech mouse I will spend the money on, and I have owned pretty much all generations of multi-button mice
417	neg	While CS will most likely send me a replacement for the mouse, since it is in warranty, I find it to be too much of a hassle to have to keep RMAing them
417	neg	This is a mouse that was purchased in Nov of 2019 and broke in Apr of 2020
417	neg	UPDATE 7/28/20: The mousse that was shipped to me as a replacement (received on 5/15), started doing the exact same thing with releasing the held button on its own
417	neg	This mouse lasted 2
417	neg	5 months before going bad
417	neg	At this point, I will stay away from any Logitech mice as they seem to not be really lasting long anymore
417	neg	It is just a waste of money and time
418	pos	The mouse is great quality, I love the weights you can add or remove from the bottom
418	pos	I love logitech period
418	pos	Here's the problem though and why I gave it 3 stars
418	pos	There's two DPI sensitivity buttons next to your left mouse button
418	pos	I mostly play shooters and I understand that this idea was probably meant for quick switching DPI and it's a great idea
418	pos	But I think it failed in execution, I found myself accidentally clicking both these buttons just trying to aim down sights and shoot and then my camera would freak out and I would die
418	pos	The simple solution is to unbind both these keys so that they do nothing and that works but at the same time they're just annoying being there
418	pos	The mouse is too small for my hand, if you have a big hand you'll find that you have a difficult time gripping this thing like I do
418	pos	(Length and width wise it's too small for me) There's a sniper button next to your left thumb, and yet again another great idea but that happens to be where I like to grip my mouse and I find myself clicking that button on accidentally constantly
418	pos	All in all great mouse for people with small hands
418	pos	Great ideas, but poorly executed on all the extra buttons
419	neg	I was really disappointed with the design of the scroll wheel
419	neg	Why anyone would give this mouse more than one star is beyond me
419	neg	You can't use a light touch of your finger to move the scroll wheel, either when using the wheel as the third button or trying to scroll with it
419	neg	You have to mash down hard with your index finger (or thumb) in order to use it as your third button, and you have to mash down and push hard with your index finger to turn the wheel (when not in free-spin mode)
419	neg	Oh well, back to my $10 Microsoft mouse
420	neg	Unfortunately, this mouse does not respect mouse sensitivity customization correctly
420	neg	The default setting for this mouse is incredibly sensitive, and hard to work with
420	neg	Logitech Hub supports the ability to change said sensitivity, unfortunately, every time a user logs off / in to the computer, or restarts the computer, the sensitivity settings are not respected, and I am forced to manually go back into the Hub, and shift the sensitivity a tiny bit (and then back), so that the driver is able to once again pick up the setting I wanted
420	neg	After searching for solutions to the this on DuckDuckGo, I see that others have had similar problems for over a year, and there does not appear to be any solution
420	neg	Even though I have had success with other Logitech products, I regret buying this mouse from them
421	neg	It was an incredible gaming mouse however out of all the mice I've ever owned this one I have been the most gentle with and it is the only mouse that has ever broke on me, it's had the least amount of use and abuse put of the tons I've owned
421	neg	The problem is that after some time lmb starts to lose its ability to detect touch, clicking and dragging stopped working, it would unclick itself and then re click itself as I held down
421	neg	This also sometimes led to double clicks if I clicked something and held my finger down between
421	neg	5-1sec
421	neg	This
421	neg	makes it entirely un-useable as a gaming mouse and anything more than web surfing, cannot drag files anymore or anything
421	neg	Talked to one of my friends and they had a similar issue
421	neg	Not sure if I'll buy another one or get a razer one instead but a lifespan of 1-2 years (warranty only covers 1 year) makes sense now
422	pos	I love the L/R click switches very responsive without much force, and the G hub customization options with profiles migrated from Logitech gaming software app
422	pos	The cord is very long and braided that's a plus, and the sensor is very much a upgrade from my G602
422	pos	I like the unlockable scroll wheel a very cool feature along with the dpi shift
422	pos	Great option with added weights for your preference
422	pos	I highly recommend especially at the price it is right now its pretty unbeatable
423	pos	Was using a G602 I got from a friend prior to buying this
423	pos	I had been looking into a wired mouse for a while now and decided that this was the best one to get
423	pos	Got it about a week early and once I started using it, I realized just how much of a difference 2000 to 4000 dpi can make
423	pos	I immediately became better at any shooting game I played and the mouse didn't lag at all as a plus
423	pos	The design is great and has a great feel on my hand
423	pos	The RGB is also a nice touch to go with the rest of my set up
423	pos	Would highly recommend
424	neg	Wished i could of use this mouse it seams very nice
424	neg	However the thumb clicks on the side is very very low so when a grab the mouse my thumb is resting on the side buttons and it makes it unusable for me since while gaming i am hitting one of this buttons and causing to cancel of what im doing and do what i have assign on it
424	neg	Wish the side thumb buttons were a bit higher up
425	neg	The physical mouse itself is very nice
425	neg	Fits well in my hand, comfortable to use, nice button placement for the most part
425	neg	However, I had a ton of issues with this mouse cycling profile, switching to onboard memory, randomly disconnecting, forgetting bindings and reverting to default settings mid game
425	neg	I uninstalled and reinstalled drivers and the Logitech software
425	neg	I tired it on different USB ports and different computers
425	neg	Nothing fixed the issues
425	neg	I was about to return the mouse and try a different product and manufacturer all together despite really liking the physical product
425	neg	Then I found out that there are two different Logitech platforms that can be used to configure Logitech peripherals: GHub and Logitech Gaming Software
425	neg	I had been using GHub initially
425	neg	At the advice of a random internet stranger, I uninstalled GHub and installed the alternative Logitech Gaming Software (LGS)
425	neg	Mouse works great now
425	neg	No issues whatsoever
425	neg	The experience left me with pretty mixed feelings overall
425	neg	I'd say the mouse would probably get a 4/5 star with the LGS software
425	neg	The button placement of the back/forward could be a little further forward or adjustable, but I have slightly larger than average hands
425	neg	For most this would probably be a non-issue
425	neg	The GHub software brings my rating down to the 2/5 star
426	pos	Bought this mouse about a year ago and recently ran into the issue of it clicking repeatedly as opposed to holding down the left mouse button
426	pos	Small problem that creates quite a bit of frustration
426	pos	Mouse held up for a year and wasn't abused in any way and just slowly got worse
426	pos	Bought mine for $50 if I remember correctly, so I'd say I got my money's worth out of it, but still disappointed in it
426	pos	I had a cheap $20 mouse that lasted 4 years *after* I super-glued the plastic part of the LMB back onto it after a decent amount of abuse and never ran into issues that impacted game-play or work
426	pos	TL;DR - Got about a year out of the mouse before it started to break without rigorous use
427	neg	Over my years of gaming and just general pc use i have never had a issue with Logitech but this mouse is horrible
427	neg	It doesn't click everytime or if your holding both down to walk lets say in WoW it stops walking and a pain to get get moving again
427	neg	I was never worried about logitech products but i am buyer beware now
427	neg	UpdateWell all i can say is the G502 Hero i bought didn't even last 5 months
427	neg	It made WoW unbearable to play
427	neg	When you hold both clicks down, instead of running all i get is a step and stop
427	neg	If you play WoW you know that's a death sentence when you can't get out of the stuff you're standing in
427	neg	I wish i would have read all the reviews before purchasing the G502 Hero , there is definitely a Real problem with it
427	neg	Now that i bought the Razer Ballistic V2 no issues whatsoever  , but i do miss the weight of the G502 Hero
428	neg	I bought this mouse after a previous Logitech gaming mouse's wheel broke
428	neg	The previous mouse lasted me 5 years, which was way beyond what I could've asked
428	neg	This one lasted 6 months
428	neg	The good: the ergonomics are great and the mouse manages to fit my monster-sized hands
428	neg	I love the tune-able weights
428	neg	The laser is quality and what I expect from Logitech's gaming offerings
428	neg	The wheel's free-spin mode is awesome
428	neg	The bad: After 6 months, the mouse doesn't generate a steady "click-and-hold" signal anymore, and sometimes a single click generates several rapid clicks instead
428	neg	I can work around the multi-click issue in OS settings, but there is nothing that can solve the spotty "click-and-hold" signal besides pressing the button down with a vice-like deathgrip, which surely worsens the underlying hardware problem
428	neg	Now, I am rarely able to successfully click-and-drag something
428	neg	Beyond frustrating for the asking price
428	neg	The problem is intermittent, though - when I wrote to Logitech's support about it I could no longer reproduce the issue and my ticket was closed
428	neg	I should mention that support wants fairly herculean effort on the part of the user to demonstrate to them that you have an issue, which felt insulting considering the sheer volume of Logi products I use and have recommended to friends and colleagues
428	neg	Seems to me that the switches being used in Logitech's mice may now be cheaper than what I'm accustomed to
428	neg	Probably going to buy from a new brand, now
429	pos	This is the most comfortable mouse I've ever held
429	pos	The mouse itself is a little on the heavier side but it's perfect for me even without the extra weights
429	pos	The extra weights are a really nice touch
429	pos	The mouse is beautiful the rgb in the G can be changed to any color on the colorwheel, sniper button is a really good thing to have when gaming, I need to get used to using it though
429	pos	The dpi buttons are set up in a good place, easy to reach when needed
429	pos	The app is easy to use to set up all the defaults, though some things are a bit confusing
429	pos	Overall an amazing mouse, couldn't have asked for better
430	neg	The mouse is an awesome looking mouse that has a lot of customizability
430	neg	I bought my first one back in Aug of 2019 and it was great
430	neg	for about 6 months
430	neg	That's when I noticed an issue with the way the mouse clicks and drags
430	neg	First the left button would double click, then the right button wouldn't maintain a constant click
430	neg	(i
430	neg	e
430	neg	when you hold it down
430	neg	) So I filed my first support ticket
430	neg	They sent me a replacement in about 3 weeks
430	neg	I then bought one for my GF thinking that it was a one off issue
430	neg	About 4 months of using the replacement I got another issue with both buttons AGAIN
430	neg	Ok I thought, another support ticket
430	neg	They again sent me a replacement
430	neg	My friend asks for a mouse recommendation and I tell him "If you get my mouse 'it works when it works
430	neg	'" He goes out to buy it
430	neg	I might be VERY unlucky, but it's gotten to the point where I have to say something about it
430	neg	My 2nd Replacement Is again doing the double clicking
430	neg	My GFs mouse is also double clicking, as well as my friends mouse
430	neg	This mouse is a TEMPORARY mouse
430	neg	It will not last more than 6 months without issues
430	neg	If you can pick it up for about 20$ then it's worth it, but for the 60$ I originally paid for it
430	neg	No way
430	neg	I might be unlucky, but 100% of the Hero 502 mice I seen, all 5, start double clicking within 6 months
431	pos	On my mac, this mouse would suddenly skip to high resolution all by itself, making the cursor zoom around the screen
431	pos	Also, I had to program the "back" button for internet browsing, but after awhile it would suddenly "forget" the setting and I would have to reload the config program again to reset it
431	pos	It was so frustrating I finally stopped using it
432	pos	This is actually our third purchase of this model
432	pos	We have one at each computer and this order was to replace one of the very first released models for this brand
432	pos	Not because it stopped working either, just cause the cable was looking a little gnarly over the past 7 years and I wanted it to be nice and smooth
432	pos	We stored the old mouse in the new box to use if any of our current give out, but I don't see that happening any time soon
433	neg	As others have seen, this mouse will give you click/double-click issues after normal use in about 12 months
433	neg	It is VERY frustrating, you will double-click unintentionally due to hardware defects in this mouse
433	neg	You will also be unable to click/drag
433	neg	The mouse will do unintentional actions which are difficult to undo
433	neg	I am scrapping the mouse since it's "limited" warranty is expired
433	neg	Very disappointing from Logitech
433	neg	DO NOT BUY this mouse
434	pos	Previous mouse was a Razer Mamba Wired
434	pos	This mouse has a specific button near the thumb to reduce the DPI to the lowest setting only while your thumb is pressing it, thus dubbing it the 'sniper button'
434	pos	I am usually at 1000 dpi while playing but with the scope + the sniper button it lets me dial in
434	pos	Something I've never had on a mouse
434	pos	Took me a couple days to get used to the new button layout, as I have been using the Razer Mamba for about 9 months now
434	pos	I can add weights, making it feel more solid
434	pos	I can already tell this mouse is going to be amazing, just also switched to the Logitech G533 too from the Razer Kraken as a larger overall switch from Razer to Logitech (Price and Quality is simply more worth it with Logitech as in the same price will get you more quality with Logitech)
434	pos	Also the scroll wheel release button is SUPER unique; lets the scroll wheel fly
434	pos	Watch some YouTube Videos to make sure your familiar but for 50$ its a mouse worth buying 100%
435	neg	I bought this mouse to replace one with a button1 click issue
435	neg	double clicking, wouldn't keep the button active while holding it firmly down
435	neg	And guess what
435	neg	this mouse started doing the same thing after 5
435	neg	5 months
435	neg	random loss of button one while holding/dragging
435	neg	I used the computer much of the day, every day, but I'm sure I didn't press the button 2 million times in 5 months
435	neg	Well, relatively sure
435	neg	:) I was too lazy to return, just really disappointed, and it's past 1 year
435	neg	Might check out other brands
435	neg	I really miss the super smooth control resolution
435	neg	Very ergonomic and comfortable
435	neg	just couldn't do the main function of a basic mouse, KEEPING THE MAIN BUTTON PRESSED
436	pos	The mouse has a great feel to it and with the adjustable weights can be made to feel even better
436	pos	The software for programming the buttons is hot garbage and renders the extra buttons useless
436	pos	The initial software install has it all working great but once you reboot your pc the software can no longer find the mouse
436	pos	It just sits there asking for you to identify the mouse while the mouse is plugged in and you're waiting to get back into your game
436	pos	If they can ever fix the software this would be a terrific mouse
436	pos	PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY BECAUSE THE GHUB SOFTWARE THAT PROGRAMS THE BUTTONS IS HOT GARBAGE
436	pos	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
436	pos	>UPDATE<
436	pos	The Ghub Software has been fixed and updated, making this mouse extremely worthwhile
436	pos	If you ever needed a great mouse or a new replacement mouse THIS IS THE ONE
437	pos	In short, I am right handed if you look to the left of this mouse it is curved in wards on the left (for my thumb
437	pos	) and leaves nothing for my pinky to rest on so it drags across the mouse pad while I'm playing
437	pos	I wish the curved in part was on the right for me and my thumb wouldn't drag either way
437	pos	Also, I have to like bring my fingers inward to play my fingers and palm isn't fit to lay across this mouse fully (my hands aren't even big)
437	pos	It's fine for now but the flaws will lead me to purchasing a different mouse when this one breaks
437	pos	Has plenty of positives and loads of features to make up for it but when you're spending over 60 bucks on a mouse for having fun why compromise there are other options
438	pos	I have mobility issues, and am an author and digital artists, and spend ninety percent of my waking hours at the computer
438	pos	This is my second Logitech G502 HERO, having worn out my previous one after years of constant use (The wheel slowly gave up
438	pos	) I pair it with a das keyboard mechanical, and between the two I couldn't be happier concerning response and quality
438	pos	I sound like  62yo fanboy, but I began on the forefront of PC's, and you probably don't understand the pain of the early, crap pointer devices
439	pos	The key features to note about this product that may make this the wrong choice for you are as follows:1
439	pos	) The odd shape and size of the mouse
439	pos	This mouse is quite large and has a contour on the right side that can cause your hand to slide off
439	pos	I personally like the size because I have medium size hands but like to rest my palm far back on the mouse with a palm grip
439	pos	I don't care for the contour however because it causes my hand to slide to that side and doesn't support my fingers over there
439	pos	That can cause my thumb to rub up against the buttons on the right side uncomfortably
439	pos	2
439	pos	) The buttons on this mouse are somewhat looser than your standard mouse
439	pos	By this I mean they have less resistance to pressing and tend to wiggle more
439	pos	This mainly applies to the two main mouse buttons and the scroll wheel
439	pos	I'm used to using mice like this, but for those who aren't it can take some adjusting to get used to it
439	pos	3
439	pos	) Another concern is (although it may not be the case in every mouse) the build quality
439	pos	When I originally received my mouse, the left mouse button was setting slightly lower than the other buttons
439	pos	This doesn't cause a functionality issue, but it causes my index finger to rub up along the ridge in between the dpi buttons and the left mouse button
439	pos	There are plenty of great features I noticed about this product, but I thought I would point out some of the features that aren't necessarily bad but may turn some people away
439	pos	Update after about 8 months of use:The pads at the bottom of the mouse tend to slide around a little bit which causes the resin that holds them to the bottom of the mouse to come out from under the pads
439	pos	This is annoying because it tends to get on my mouse pad and also collects a lot of dust around the pad (which is hard to clean) where the resin is exposed
440	pos	This is my second G502
440	pos	The reason this is my second is the middle button (scroll wheel button) does not work anymore
440	pos	I don't really use the button too much so I dont know if it was wear-and-tear or a defect
440	pos	In any case the over all mouse is excellent
440	pos	'Can Confirm'  The middle (wheel) button is not good
440	pos	As I said this is my second mouse and this one too has similar issue with the middle mouse button
440	pos	The side buttons have become overly sensitive
440	pos	when I click the button down it activates the side buttons
440	pos	Not a good thing when you are in the middle of an intense one-v-one, or just trying to perform one action and another action happens
440	pos	:(
441	pos	Everyone who loves FPS games know that this mouse is at the top of the food chain
441	pos	It’s hard to beat a G502
441	pos	I have gone through 3 of these
441	pos	Not because of mouse failure but because of anger management failure
441	pos	Anyway, The weight adjustment is very nice, people complain about the software, I’ve come to like it with the updates
441	pos	It not exactly user friendly, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll realize how in depth Logitech has gone to give you as much customization as possible
441	pos	The response time is almost unmatched
441	pos	I have bigger hands, and at times the mouse does feel a little on the small side, but the button placement for side buttons is perfect, the metal scroll wheel is one of my favorite features
441	pos	The overall design is very sleek with a gamer focused appeal
441	pos	If you’re on the edge, prices for this mouse have gone down at the time of writing this it’s only $40, which is an incredible value for what you get in this mouse
441	pos	Even @$50 I’ll still buy another one if I break my now 3rd one
441	pos	Lol
442	neg	I understand the hype, but the scroll wheel is atrocious
442	neg	If you middle click you also activate one of the middle left/right scroll buttons
442	neg	The free wheel is ok but the tactile wheel feels bad
442	neg	This mouse would be a 5 star from me, but I had to return it because of the wheel
442	neg	Also you can’t fully program a bunch of features on the mouse’s memory
442	neg	You need the app to rebind specific keys like shift, ctrl, and alt
442	neg	Not a deal breaker, but kinda lame
443	pos	It's the most popular for a reason
443	pos	After owning a cheap red dragon and a quite nice Corsair mouse I tried my friends 502 while staying with him and was instantly in love
443	pos	It's lightweight, the ergonomics just feel right and the button placement is fantastic
443	pos	The software has it's quirks but it allows you to remap and create macros for games even if they don't like you remap, it's great
443	pos	In the grand scheme it's a pretty cheap mouse for how great it is, would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good mouse
444	pos	This is my go to mouse for my FPS games
444	pos	Combining this with a gaming keypad allows my gaming to improve
444	pos	The software to modify DPI is a bit confusing but once you get the hang of it, it works well
444	pos	You can change the DPI on the fly during a game
444	pos	The software also let's you reassign the different buttons
444	pos	Very useful
444	pos	Newer versions of this mouse has a better cable that doesn't kink as much as the older versions
444	pos	It is sturdy enough for many years of play without breaking down
445	neg	All the things are great
445	neg	Buttons, weights, everything
445	neg	I loved this mouse, and told many people about it
445	neg	I had a Razor before this
445	neg	For $50 in 2008, the Razor lasted me 11 years
445	neg	This mouse here, the "Hero", lasted not even a year and a half
445	neg	The left button, the most important button, screws up all the time
445	neg	I can't even click and drag
445	neg	Apparently, this is an issue with this mouse in particular
445	neg	Look it up before you buy it, it wouldn't hurt
446	pos	If you want a mouse that isnt too loaded with too many buttons or wont cramp your hand then this one might just be for you
446	pos	I've used the original g502 for years, recently bought this  'Hero' version and I can say it still holds up just as great
446	pos	I'm not big on my computer mouse having too many buttons and love this one for that
446	pos	It's not a big mouse either
446	pos	Fits perfectly in the palm of my hand
446	pos	My old one lasted me years, it's still not broken, I just decided it was time to get a new one
446	pos	I had originally bought a Corsair mouse but that thing was too big and was cramping my hand
446	pos	This one does not do that
446	pos	Love it very much and I'll buy it again if I ever need another
447	pos	This is my second G502 after the first one developed a double click issue in the left mouse button after 3-4 years of daily use
447	pos	Overall I'm happy with the performance and given that I use this as my daily mouse for work, I'm okay with it developing issues after 3+ years of constant use
447	pos	The mouse glides very smoothly and the included weights allow you to fine-tune how you like your mouse to feel
447	pos	The mouse comes with plenty of buttons and the Logitech software makes it very easy to customize what they do
447	pos	The RGB lights add some good looks although I typically have it turned off
448	pos	With only a slight negative rating on ergonomics due to the wrist / fingers bending awkwardly to reach certain buttons, this is still the best all around gaming mouse on the market
448	pos	I do digital design (photoshop, Affinity, AutoCAD), and number of programmable buttons is extremely important to cut down on moving pointer back and forth to the toolbar
448	pos	I haven't found another mouse that accomplishes this, with no lag, as well as the G502
448	pos	The inclusion of optional weights for prevention of jitters and shakes of the hand is a welcome addition
449	pos	Given the shape, I find it kind of hard to sit my hand on it naturally in a way that can reach all the buttons
449	pos	I have to sit my hand way far forward to be able to reach everything
449	pos	Other then that it seems to work great
449	pos	On my personal computer the software is nice and seems to work well, on my work computer where I can't install software there are some things that I cannot adjust (RGB), but not a big deal
449	pos	Overall seems like a pretty nice wired mouse
450	neg	Ergonomically superior and well sized for large hands, this mouse feels premium in the palm
450	neg	Initially the mouse performed with unsurpassed accuracy, however, as time went on, intermittent switch failure in the left and right click switches began to occur
450	neg	My first 502 Hero lasted a little over a year in the demanding Division 2 environment
450	neg	Another problem I experienced occurred with on-the-fly DPI switching; DPI would increase just fine, however the return to lower, more controllable DPI settings had to be reset outside the application
450	neg	I received my first 502 Hero as a gift
450	neg	last Christmas (2019)  I purchased a replacement (this order) which arrived DOA, no lights, no action
450	neg	I have been using Logitech products for close to 22 years
450	neg	My original G5 laser gaming mouse, which released in late 2005, is still my backup device
450	neg	Logitech quality has suffered in the past 5 years
450	neg	For the record this review is of the product and not of Amazon's service
450	neg	Amazon has taken care of my needs beyond my expectations, even offering to send me a replacement prior to receiving the RMA of this item
451	pos	I'll start by saying that I'm a huge Logitech nerd
451	pos	I love everything they sell
451	pos	Quality products that look good, feel good, and work good
451	pos	I bought this mouse to replace my G402
451	pos	The G502 Hero looks nicer
451	pos	Has synching LEDs that can be paired with other Logitech gear and there is a neat magnetic panel underneath where the weights go
451	pos	I used all of the weights because it seems more accurate with precise movement
451	pos	The only thing I dont like is that the profiles can be switched on the mouse with a button, colors and all (which is very cool
451	pos	) But that also drastically changes the DPI with every profile unless you change them all to the same DPI manually
451	pos	This seems pointless because there are already 2 DPI buttons on the mouse
452	pos	This is noticeably better than my G500 that I upgraded from
452	pos	Could have been age of hardware or software degrading the old G500, but either way this is clearly superior and the LED effects are awesome
452	pos	I liked the idea of extra buttons on the G502 and they seem all reachable
452	pos	Also seems to be mechanical improvement to DPI setting buttons, which you can reprogram per game if you want
452	pos	So far, this has been a really nice upgrade
452	pos	The game moves exactly where I put the cursor in a way I can't explain other than "tracking" being excellent
453	pos	I love so much about this mouse
453	pos	The weights are probably my favorite part, being able to adjust that per game and need is amazing
453	pos	I do wish I had one-two more (max no more please) buttons on the side for tying to macros and what have you, but this is an excellent mouse without breaking the bank
453	pos	I love the ability to have rough or loose scrolling on the wheel
453	pos	Easy to clean too (games, clean yo dang mice, human hands be gross
453	pos	)
454	neg	Mouse worked fine for a couple of months
454	neg	Then would randomly stop registering mouse1 as being held down unless an abnormal amount of force is used
454	neg	This issue would manifest in all applications, including just dragging windows from the OS
454	neg	Contacted logitech support and they jerked me around and expected an unreal amount of troubleshooting steps before they would consider my case further
454	neg	Even though the issue is known
454	neg	They wouldn't support my claim without rebinding mouse1 to a different key with their software and testing it and other ridiculous steps
454	neg	Even if the issue affects all applications and is known
454	neg	Used to buy logitech mice exclusively and religiously, happily with another retailer that actually offers support now
455	pos	I owned an older version of this mouse that I love and trust, but unfortunately it broke down a while back
455	pos	Naturally I ordered this as a replacement since I know and stand by the quality of Logitech products
455	pos	This one came slightly defective, however
455	pos	For every ~100 clicks, it will miss a click for some reason, which can be quite annoying for gaming
455	pos	I've researched online and it doesn't seem to be a common issue, so I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, which seemed to perform fine
455	pos	Overall it wasn't a big deal, but keep this in mind while using your mouse and definitely reach out to Amazon for support if you are experiencing the same thing
456	neg	The mouse was OK at first
456	neg	The five buttons were convenient, and the ability to customize its weight may appeal to some
456	neg	The backlighting is kind of cool
456	neg	However, it quickly built up a static charge that prevents the buttons from working properly
456	neg	When the buttons are held down, they randomly click every few seconds or so, which completely destroys the gameplay for which it was intended
456	neg	There is a workaround that involves unplugging the mouse and clicking furiously to discharge the static, but it's a very temporary solution that reduces the frequency of the clicks for a few hours before it's back to randomly clicking every few seconds when attempting to drag objects or move the camera
456	neg	Overall, I'm very disappointed with the mouse
457	pos	Pros: basically all of the features I love about the G9 mouse (I still have it, but 10 years on, I felt a potential replacement was in order)  button placement is intuitive  scroll wheel toggle is on the top side of the mouse as opposed to the bottom on the G9Cons:  It's not the G9Reality: It's a good mouse
457	pos	It's not as comfortable to use as my old school Logitech G9 mouse, but that could well be because I've been using it for 10 years
457	pos	That said, the features are on par with, if not better than the G9
457	pos	The build quality doesn't seem as good as the 9, but I get it
457	pos	Logitech is a company out to make a profit
457	pos	That said the G9 kind of tinted my view and looked to Logitech for a replacement
457	pos	Well played, Logi
457	pos	Well played
457	pos	Update November 25th, 2019: I really couldn't deal with the odd angle of the mouse and went with another Logitech mouse (G900 Chaos Spectrum)
457	pos	Don't get me wrong, the Hero is a really nice mouse
457	pos	It just isn't comfortable for my grip/hand placement
458	pos	I bought this as a replacement for my failing Logitech G9x
458	pos	The USB cable wore out after several years or use
458	pos	-Pros--Better lighting options than my old mouse
458	pos	Similar to my G910 Keyboard
458	pos	-Hero Sensor-More programmable buttons-The ability to change the weight of the mouse
458	pos	Similar to my old G9 and G9x mice
458	pos	-Cons--Less ergonomic
458	pos	My old mouse had interchangeable hand-grips
458	pos	Both of which felt better in my hand than the G502
458	pos	-Awkwardly positioned DPI buttons, next to the left mouse button
458	pos	I am constantly hitting them by accident, which is annoying
458	pos	(It's possible to disable, or reassign their function in the software settings
458	pos	) But I mostly feel like they get in the way
458	pos	-Overall-I loved my old G9 and G9x
458	pos	But as a replacement, this will do
459	pos	To start things off, I’ve been using this mouse for a few weeks now for heavy gaming and video editing
459	pos	So far, I have encountered zero problems
459	pos	The packaging and setup process was easy, and there were even included weights to make the mouse heavier for gaming (I haven’t found use for them)
459	pos	Also, the Logitech control interface wasn’t too confusing
459	pos	When the mouse was ready, using it was amazing as I felt a noticeable difference from Razer mouses
459	pos	The mouse wasn’t too heavy, and had helpful advantages like its buttons (I highly recommend setting them up to your personal preferences) Even when editing or using my PC, the mouse is comfortable for my big hands, and smooth when using
459	pos	Overall this mouse may be a bit ugly and pricey, but it’s made for gaming and not looks
459	pos	The quality is great for the price, and i’m happy with it
459	pos	(Also attached is a crappy photo I took of it)
460	pos	Mice have become more narrow over the past two and a half decades
460	pos	Am I supposed to be dragging my ring finger and pinky
460	pos	Curling them up under my palm
460	pos	Or hold the whole thing sideways
460	pos	Give me a nice deck for them to ride around on like the thumb
460	pos	Software isn't perfect, but it's closer to it than any previous Logitech software I've used
460	pos	Button profile sticks, only actual issue I've noticed is that sometimes the LEDs go factory default after the system comes out of standby
461	pos	First, I purchased the G502 Proteus Core, the first version of this mouse, then once that wore down after several years of use, I upgraded to the G502 HERO
461	pos	I'm now on my second G502 HERO, this one I purchased in March of 2021, and no other mouse beats this one in features and performance
461	pos	It's ergonomic, lightweight (or weighted with the included weights), and has easily programmable software and hardware profiles
461	pos	I hope there comes a day where I can look for another mouse, and switch to a different model, either by Logitech or some other brand, but the G502 Hero is currently the best mouse on the market for people who both want a good gaming mouse and a good productivity mouse
462	pos	GOOD: I really want to like the mouse
462	pos	The sensor is great and the feel of the mouse in my hands is great
462	pos	The weight adjustment is also a strong positive
462	pos	The logitech software works great and makes this mouse very resourceful
462	pos	BAD:The mouse wheel is horrible; it an infinite scroll that can be toggles
462	pos	The downside to this
462	pos	even this it toggled off the wheel feels unstable
462	pos	The wheel itself is coated by metal and makes it slip from one notch to another; due to this it makes the mouse sometimes not scroll all the expected lines, or an extra
462	pos	Overall:Good mouse, but not susceptible for what its advertised
462	pos	Scroll wheel makes it not usable for gaming
463	pos	I moved to this mouse from a R
463	pos	A
463	pos	T
463	pos	6 that had been dying on me, and after reading some reviews settled on this mouse
463	pos	It seems to work great both for work and gaming
463	pos	The G-Hub lighting stuff seems like a bit much, but I've never been into filling my PC full of colored LEDs
463	pos	The G-Hub software itself is flaky flaky flaky
463	pos	I'm really happy with the mouse though, my only real complaint is that it's not nearly as heavy as my old mouse, even with all of the weights added to it
464	pos	This is by far the best mouse I have ever owned, and I had the previous versions of this mouse that came out some years ago, and used them over the years
464	pos	Everything about this mouse is a plus, and I noticed only one con, so I'm gonna mention that
464	pos	The con is the button that unlocks the scroll wheel, the button sometimes goes half way and appears to be stuck, but if you press on it using a little bit more force the first time, this doesn't happen
464	pos	That's the only thing I could find that could be improved, I love everything else
464	pos	Note: if you are on Linux, then look for piper (package through apt - Debian)
464	pos	This will allow you to edit most of the options of this mouse
465	pos	Overall this mouse is amazing, best gaming mouse I've ever owned
465	pos	I love everything from the size, the button layout, to even the adjustable weight
465	pos	However not everything is rainbows and sunshine
465	pos	I have had this mouse for barely 6 months and already the right mouse button is malfunctioning badly
465	pos	This would not normally be a problem as I usually buy my Logitech gear directly from the Logitech website itself and their RMA process is very smooth and customer friendly
465	pos	I am having a difficult time trying to get help online from Amazon, there isn't any easy way to request RMA/Warranty information or get the RMA process started (I prefer not to have to call if It can be avoided)
465	pos	With some help from Google I found 2 email addresses for supposed customer support (cis@amazon
465	pos	com, primary@amazon
465	pos	com), however upon emailing them both I get a generic automated response: "Hello from Amazon,You've written to an address that does not accept incoming direct e-mails, but we have provided links to help answer some common questions
465	pos	"The email contains a bunch of links that don't help me at all, the "Returns & Refunds" link doesn't let me select the item in question
465	pos	Overall completely disappointed in Amazon's online custom,er service setup
465	pos	Shame because I'm a frequent purchaser, long time Prime member etc
465	pos	I was always told returns/refunds/rma's etc on products sold directly by Amazon was a quick and painless process
465	pos	Could not be any further from the truth
466	pos	The media could not be loaded
466	pos	The app and software are easy to use and modify
466	pos	Reposnce is amazing
466	pos	Not a big fan of rgb lights but can be turned off on the app
466	pos	Weights help big time if you are looking into competitive gaming, no more mouse sway if you are frustrated in a match and the mouse is too light
466	pos	Love the product and highly supported it
467	pos	After a few months, one of the side buttons started making a weird double-clicky sound and had a real strange tactile feel when clicking
467	pos	I contacted support, and they ended up sending me a new one free of charge
467	pos	My only other gripe is that the side buttons are a little bit far back on the mouse, so i really have to scrunch my thumb up to hit the back button (especially in games)
467	pos	I don't really notice it anymore though
467	pos	It's a nice mouse
468	pos	It is taller than my last mouse so had to lower keyboard drawer to make it fit
468	pos	Otherwise it is top quality that I expect from Logitech
468	pos	Really can't go wrong with anything you buy from Logitech
468	pos	They have been around since the PC was invented and consistently produced good products ever since
468	pos	I bought their speakers as well and love them
469	pos	The controls are great for changing sensitivity and the weights are useful for setting the weight
469	pos	I set mine to the heaviest, I like it that way for some reason
469	pos	The best feature by far is the scroll wheel
469	pos	I just unlock that thing and give it a spin
469	pos	I hear my coworkers constantly clicking away rolling their scroll wheels when reviewing large code files
469	pos	I always recommend this mouse to them
469	pos	I had a Razr Copperhead before this, which I loved
469	pos	This does not feel all that different, but with the scroll wheel it is a real winner
470	neg	Simply put, the G502 suffers from very common build issues
470	neg	A quick google for 'G502 double click' will return several posts of people complaining about the same issue
470	neg	My mouse in particular worked for about 8 months before it developed issues with both clicks
470	neg	I can't drag and drop without dropping a click, which means aiming in FPS is a real hurdle
470	neg	I'm not the only either, as there are several people
470	neg	The root of the cause is the OMRON switch that Logitech uses, which means that you can very easily go through 2 or 3 mice with the same issues
470	neg	I used a Logitech mouse for over 6 years before this, bus frankly the G502 is just a stain in the company's otherwise good record
470	neg	You might take your chances and get a good mouse, but there's no guarantee with this model
471	pos	I needed a mouse that would place nice with a KVM hooked up to my PC and Mac that had the ability to "unlock" the scroll wheel for quick scroll, and that had multiple buttons on the side
471	pos	This mouse just happened to have the exact number of extra buttons: play/pause, volume up and down, forward and backward, and one more to link to taking a screenshot
471	pos	I did disable the scroll wheel's side to side operation as I was hitting those accidentally, and the scroll wheel does sit a little too high for my taste, but other than that the software plays nice across both OSs and I'm happy with my purchase
472	neg	I purchased this mouse less than a year ago and recently began to have issues with the left mouse button registering multiple clicks on press
472	neg	I went to a web app that shows mouse events and the issue seemed to be caused when any pressure is applied off center (like near the edges of the button)
472	neg	It would register up to 10 clicks if I pressed once along the edges and held down for a few seconds before releasing
472	neg	I've looked into this problem here/elsewhere and it seems to be faulty switches being used for this series
472	neg	Another issue I've had since the beginning has been the middle mouse button
472	neg	In addition the scrolling up/down and middle mouse click, you can also rock the middle mouse to the sides to click a middle left/right input
472	neg	The problem is that it is nearly impossible to click the middle mouse button without "accidentally" clicking the middle left/right button instead
472	neg	From comments here, it seems to be a crap-shoot on whether you get a easy to use middle mouse button from this model
472	neg	I debated on returning the mouse from the start, but I've gotten around this by simply disabling the middle mouse button entirely (and remapping to another button) while keeping the left/right middle mouse buttons functionality
472	neg	I lost a button on the mouse, but still had plenty mappings for what I used it for (have another MMO mouse for games needing more buttons)
472	neg	My brother has a Razer Trinity mouse and I have another previously mentioned Logitech MMO mouse with this same button feature and have no problems clicking all 3 middle mouse buttons without issue
472	neg	I'm going to try to RMA this mouse, but If I could go back I would have returned at the start

473	pos	I really like this mouse
473	pos	The side that holds your thumb is heaven sent, all the side buttons are handy, and I like that you can change the weights
473	pos	However, I read the reviews and knew that this investment wasn’t gonna be the best because so many people had issues
473	pos	I thought my issues weren’t gonna happen until at least a month, but not even THREE days after purchasing, my scroll wheel is like a fidget spinner
473	pos	Lol
473	pos	Honestly, y’all better off spending ya money on something similar but not logitech, cause I don’t think they really care about the production of their products
474	neg	The mouse itself is nice, but the center scroll wheel is unusable
474	neg	The wheel doesn't catch, as other reviews have described as well, making it terrible for gaming and for general reading of the web (if you use the center scroll wheel to move down and up pages)
474	neg	Returned and bought the Logitech G PRO Hero Wired Gaming Mouse instead
474	neg	Not as slick looking, but functions great
474	neg	Unlike the G502 HERO, the center scroll wheel works perfectly on the G PRO Hero
475	pos	I absolutely loved this mouse while it was working correctly
475	pos	I bought this to replace my Razer Naga since Razer products have been getting worse over the years
475	pos	It was responsive, the button layout was fantastic, and the weight was almost perfect for what I needed
475	pos	That all ended up about 2 months after I bought it
475	pos	Out of nowhere, it started to double click all on it's own
475	pos	This effectively rendered the mouse 100% useless for gaming
475	pos	I ended up going back to my old retired Naga
475	pos	:(
476	pos	I'm gonna keep this short; Logitech products are generally an all-rounder when it comes to hardware
476	pos	If you're looking for the type of gaming mouse that's basically well rounded but doesn't excel at any particular task then this is your tool
476	pos	It feels great, materials used were solid and sturdy enough to last you throughout long gaming sessions(Generally 8-12 hours)
476	pos	That being said, to an average gamer that doesn't really need extensive button mapping and extremely precise mouse accuracy it's more than excellent and will provide you with a pretty good gaming experience
476	pos	The button functions even get weird if you program your mouse to have too high of a DPI so I'd be careful with that
477	neg	This is not for people with small hands at all
477	neg	My mouse would not actuate the click because of poor quality control on the moldings so gaming was horrific and holding Left Mouse button down is nearly impossible
477	neg	I highly recommend another brand of mouse if you are a woman or a small handed person or require holding a left mouse button to work with
477	neg	I give it a "Do Not Buy" rating when an Off Brand has better quality control
478	pos	After many years of using a G500, it took a day or two to get used to the new feel
478	pos	However, I am glad I did
478	pos	This mouse is great
478	pos	I use the extra weights to make it heavier like my older mouse, but it feels great with or without them
478	pos	I did have a little fun playing with the RGB, but mostly I just wanted a mouse that would bounce easily between productivity and gaming and this one checks all the boxes
479	pos	I ordered a few other mouses before I settled on this one
479	pos	I couldn't afford the wireless edition and really didn't want to deal with cords, but it's not a big deal now that I have it
479	pos	The moment I unboxed this and held it, I could clearly feel and see how high quality the components are
479	pos	Left and right click have a certain smoothness to them that I haven't felt on another mouse
479	pos	The RGB customization is a nice plus, but it doesn't offer that much in the way of options
479	pos	The infinite scroll wheel is dope and has already changed the game for my mindless reddit scrolling
479	pos	I also like that the scroll wheel is made of metal, it just feels nice when you rotate it and feel the snap when it's not on the infinite scroll setting
479	pos	Finally, this thing offers a sensor that is as smooth as butter
479	pos	I ordered this with a hard mouse pad and dang
479	pos	It's like moving a warm spoon over some country crock
479	pos	Overall I'm highly satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a nice mouse for a better daily grind or gaming with a comp
480	pos	I love the mouse
480	pos	It is definitely for someone with smallish hands
480	pos	No way my husband could use this mouse
480	pos	The only problem with it is that the bottom gamma off all the time
480	pos	It opens so you can adjust the weight with provided weights
480	pos	It is held closed with a magnet but falls off all the time
480	pos	We put a little Lock-tite on the slip in edge and it has held sense
481	pos	Just like most of the razer products it feels so nice in the hand when gaming
481	pos	All buttons feel like they’re in the perfect place
481	pos	I recommended this to my good friend and he agrees it’s the best mouse he’s owned
481	pos	Would definitely recommend
482	neg	Thought it was just me but after testing two other mice and with two separate machines, this mouse left click is constantly cutting out, skipping and has terrible input lag
482	neg	Doing some research I found that it's very common with this model, no wonder it was on sale back when I bought it
482	neg	Too late to return it now and severely disappointed as I've always but Logitech but now I'm going to branch out and try a different brand
482	neg	Again, disappointed for a $90 product with such a large name behind it
483	pos	I used the G503 spectrum mouse before and i hated the braided cable it got
483	pos	if u keep it in one position the cable is gonna get stiff and be locked in that way but it was still a good mouse felt nice and smooth
483	pos	but this new G503 hero has a lovely cable which I'm loving so far with all the goodies from the spectrum and the smoothness feels like much better with this and feels better in my hand its a steal for the price it sells for 10 out 10 for me
484	pos	Absolutely, love this mouse
484	pos	I don’t really game but the faster settings helps me complete work for my job quicker
484	pos	I can take test faster too
484	pos	My husband has one for gaming and he loves it for gaming
484	pos	The keys lock for scrolling and unlock
484	pos	It has color choices
484	pos	I added a few weighs to mine which comes with it
484	pos	Love this mouse
485	neg	so i have been having this mouse for alomost 2 years i loved it at the first year
485	neg	I used it lightly then started gaming heavily on it and thought nothing of it
485	neg	As of writing right now my left click is not responding as effectively and it seems like online forums complain about the same thing
485	neg	It seems to be a manufacturing problem which is pretty sad because nhoraml usage could be ignored but gaming is a huge setback from making this the perfect product
485	neg	Do not buy this mouse if you want it to have an early expiration date
486	neg	I loved everything about this mouse -- it feels incredibly natural and accurate
486	neg	However, after 6 months of just ordinary computer usage (not gaming, working on spreadsheets and programming and the like) it stopped being able to consistently drag windows
486	neg	Then I realized that left clicks weren't registering consistently anymore
486	neg	Then I did a quick Google search and it appears that EVERY G502 develops this problem after a relatively short amount of usage
486	neg	I ended up plugging in an old G5 Logitech gaming mouse that I had sitting around, and it still works perfectly
486	neg	I'm not buying any new products from Logitech after this, I'll just buy used ones -- they work just as well and they're reliable
487	pos	Got this when it was on a pretty good sale
487	pos	I like it, but some of the buttons are pressed too easily
487	pos	For example, the DPI buttons change too easily when left-clicking
487	pos	It's frustrating, so I just disabled those buttons within the G Hub software
487	pos	I like a light mouse, so I didn't add any of the weights and it's the perfect weight for me
487	pos	The wheel has a satisfying "grind" to it so you can tell how much/how fast you are scrolling, unlike some other mice where you may over-scroll
488	pos	As of this writing, I'm currently overhauling my PC gaming setup
488	pos	My previous mouse, a Corsair Dark Core RBG, had completely lost all functionality only after two years from purchase
488	pos	I was blueprinting some ideas for a replacement and read a lot of great things about Logitech G products
488	pos	I've used previous Logitech equipment some odd years ago for general computer use and thought I would take the plunge on the gaming aspect of the brand
488	pos	Needless to say, i'm glad I did and the good reviews for this product are well-deserved
488	pos	The mouse feels wonderful to hold
488	pos	I was worried at first because it did feel a little light and hollow out of the box
488	pos	This is where the included five 3
488	pos	6g weights come into play
488	pos	The weights act to give some stability for higher DPI settings and also give some weight to help with maneuvering the mouse on certain surfaces
488	pos	This part might actually be tricky upon getting it out of the box as I had to mess around and add/remove weights until I just got the right natural feeling when moving it
488	pos	This was not too huge of an issue as even the Logitech website had recommended adjusting the weights until you feel what works
488	pos	I'm glad the ability to change the weight was included as I have big hands and need an ample amount of weight for the mouse to feel great in my palm
488	pos	The middle mouse wheel is unique in that it has a toggle button for a dual-mode use; one has the mouse wheel scroll freely and super smoothly (perfect for browsing or getting to the top/bottom of a page with just a quick flick) and the other mode is a "scroll clicker," perfect for making precise digital art or designs or when you need to swap out to that second weapon in your favorite FPS
488	pos	Its because of this that the mouse has more functionality beyond just gaming
488	pos	The ergonomic build is great as well
488	pos	No matter how I hold it, the mouse feels like it melds into the shape of my palm and thumb
488	pos	The thumb rest is a nice addition too, keeping my thumb from sinking too low or dragging around my mousepad
488	pos	The quality of the entire mouse is just awesome
488	pos	Everything from the material used to the lighting effects and the design itself is perfect
488	pos	I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great mouse to game with, wither it's for the casual gamer or the PC gaming enthusiast
489	pos	The media could not be loaded
489	pos	I have used many many different mice
489	pos	Razer, Logitech, Mad Catz, Corsair
489	pos	All pretty similar really
489	pos	First time in a long time I haven't bought a 500 button mouse
489	pos	Not playing MMO's like I used to and didn't have a need to have fast button skills for my heals anymore
489	pos	Always loved how logitech felt in my hand
489	pos	Loved the idea of weights, because I like a heavier feel
489	pos	Plug and play and feels good
489	pos	Not at all disappointed
490	pos	Holy crap is it phenomenal
490	pos	I never knew I needed 3200 DPI, but I'm never going back
490	pos	The adjustable weights give it a nice heft, the size fits well, especially in larger hands
490	pos	All the buttons are great
490	pos	It's honestly one of the best features
490	pos	The scroll wheel is phenomenal
490	pos	The sheer adjustability is great, and the G HUB software is easy to use and one of the lest terrible of its kind
490	pos	It's blisteringly fast, and precise as well
490	pos	It's useful for everything from gaming to CAD modeling
490	pos	If I never had to get another mouse, I would be happy
491	pos	I've had 3 of these mice
491	pos	The first 2 were under warranty so I was able to get it replaced at no charge
491	pos	However, this last mouse, that I got as a replacement for one I purchased Sept
491	pos	2019 (I got it January 2020)
491	pos	This one too, is on it's way out
491	pos	I really love everything about this mouse, until it stops working
491	pos	I want a mouse that is more reliable, so I'm going to try the Deathadder elite this time
491	pos	And it has a 2 year warranty
492	neg	So, the mouse itself is pretty basic
492	neg	You can change the weight, it feels nice in my hand, and you can click one of the top buttons to change your mouse response time, but the software that you need to customize it, Logitech G Hub, has so many bugs
492	neg	I, like many others, have tried to download the software, but it gets stuck and downloads forever, and Logitech refuses to do anything about it
492	neg	And trying to remove the unusable software from your PC is also a pain
492	neg	Another thing, the mouse wheel glides a bit TOO well
492	neg	I'll be playing a game, and if I move my mouse a certain way, the wheel moves and cycles through my hot bar
492	neg	It's also a pain when you're just browsing the internet and you want to scroll down a little, and it sends you to the bottom of the page
492	neg	Honestly, don't buy this unless it's on sale, or until Logitech gets their s*** together
493	neg	Designers clearly had never seen or used a mouse before, but merely overheard a vague description of one at a particularly loud social event
493	neg	Useless button right where thumb is supposed to grip, gets in the way of you trying to do anything precise like aim in a video game
493	neg	Scroll wheel is raised and extremely sensitive, so you'll accidentally scroll on webpages or cycle inventory in games
493	neg	There is a button near the thumb that sends you "back" on web browsers
493	neg	I just discovered this because I ACCIDENTALLY DELETED THIS VERY REVIEW AND AM WRITING IT FOR A SECOND TIME
494	neg	I purchased this mouse in the beginning of 2020 and in May, it is starting to double-click
494	neg	The issue has become so bad that it is sometimes impossible for me to highlight text, drag icons around on my desktop, or play a character like Hanzo in Overwatch
494	neg	I wish I had done more research before purchasing any type of mouse from Logitech, but the issue stems from the switches they use
494	neg	These fail relatively quickly because of how cheap they are, coming from China
494	neg	Many other people around the internet have had the same issues so most likely, you're going to need to RMA the mouse every four months, learn how to fix the switches yourself, or just buy a computer mouse from another company
494	neg	I had used a Corsair M65 without any actual trouble for over two years prior to deciding to try something new and will be trashing this one to go back to Corsair
494	neg	I have been PC gaming for over twenty years now and have never found myself as frustrated with a mouse since using the G502 HERO
494	neg	Logitech will tell you that it could be the USB port or that the mouse just needs its drivers updated but this simply isn't true
494	neg	If a mouse is double clicking, it's likely hardware within the device that is failing or broken
495	neg	This mouse has a good feel
495	neg	I like the weight and the button placement
495	neg	I have had this mouse almost exactly 2 years
495	neg	About a year ago, I started getting the double click issue (Google it
495	neg	It is a common problem) on the left mouse button
495	neg	I pulled it apart and messed with the switch and was able to to resolve the issue but the click just isn't the same
495	neg	Now I am starting to experience the same issue with the right button
495	neg	Looks like it's time to buy a new mouse, and I will not be getting another Logitech G
496	pos	The mouse is actually pretty good
496	pos	and at a very good price
496	pos	The software is the most confluting unnecessary POS I have ever come across
496	pos	If the hub didn't look so good, I would have mistaken it for a government website
496	pos	I would have given this mouse a 4 or 5 but because they (for some unknown reason) refuse to update their software I am compelled to give it a 3
497	pos	After a few months of use, the mouse is having this double click issue that frequently affects me when I'm trying to play a game
497	pos	I will attempt to press and hold down the mouse button and it will stutter and think that I have let go and clicked again
497	pos	It also makes it tough to drag windows across my screens since I have to try several times until I can click the window without it double clicking
498	pos	I made the switch to the G502 from a Corsair M65 Elite RGB and its ridiculous how much better this is in overall quality feel, the Ghub software is easier to use, and this is personal preference but heavier, the G came with heavier weights to insert into the mouse, I prefer a heavier feeling mouse so I dont fling the thing across my desk lol
498	pos	Of course time will tell if it'll last longer than the Corsair but honestly, I've gone through three Corsair mice in less than a year, I have high hopes
499	pos	I've owned this mouse for about 6 months and up until now, everything has been great
499	pos	The mouse is super responsive, very ergonomic, and all the customizable buttons are fun to play with
499	pos	As of late, I've started to notice that the left click will often double or triple click when only pressed once (probably an issue with the switch)
499	pos	As one can imagine, typical tasks such as navigating Windows and playing games become a nightmare
499	pos	Programs are accidentally double clicked and launched, and inputs are inconsistent
499	pos	I love this product, but I'm afraid that I will have to purchase a new mouse if I am unable to fix or resolve this
500	pos	After endless problems with other mice with double clicking in the first 3 weeks to 6 months, this mouse has been a solid performer
500	pos	With the high definition sensor unlocked, it has provided me with the most accurate gaming experience to date
500	pos	This all starts several years ago, I had one of these G502's that I severed the USB cable by accident with my keyboard drawer slides
500	pos	The retail shop had no exact replacement, so I was forced to exchange it for a different model / brand
500	pos	I was less than happy with that device and traded it in for another model / brand
500	pos	It started misbehaving in less than 4 months
500	pos	While not a new device, the G502 Hero has been solid for all my needs from day one
500	pos	Sometimes an old standard wins the day
501	neg	Initially, this mouse was great, however, at the eleven-month mark, the mouse started getting the dreaded double-clicking issue that Logitech is known for
501	neg	Attempting to claim a warranty on the mouse has been a hassle
501	neg	First, I had to file a ticket and wait for a reply, then provide a picture of the mouse along with stuff written next to it on paper to confirm I have the mouse, and THEN they wanted me to record a video of my mouse and screen showing the issue
501	neg	I stopped right there
501	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again
502	pos	Honestly, I don't care if my mouse has all sorts of bells and whistles
502	pos	I want it to be comfortable and reliably repeat the functions a mouse was originally intended for
502	pos	This one has been decent so far
502	pos	I'm waiting to see how long it takes for the little clip inside the clicker buttons to break since that's what's happened to my last 2 mice, but until then it's working to my satisfaction
503	pos	I have a wireless version of this mouse as well and while I like the lack of a cable this is an excellent mouse if you don’t mind the cable
503	pos	You have a case of weights so that you can easily change the weight of the mouse to suit your preferences
503	pos	You can also change the DPI on the fly which is nice
504	neg	G-Hub crashes constantly, and when it does the mouse does not retain its dpi settings making for an incredibly annoying user experience
504	neg	The dpi adjust buttons are in a bad location that constantly get pressed accidentally so I had to disable them
504	neg	EDIT: After investigating I solved the issue; but it shouldn't have been an issue and should have been enabled by default (on-board memory mode) but Logitech wants to force their software on people
504	neg	Adjusted rating slightly
504	neg	This mouse is way way overrated because it's pushed by amazon recommendation
505	pos	I bought this mouse for Christmas and it was something that I had been looking at for 2 years now
505	pos	I opened the box and it was awesome
505	pos	I plugged it in right away and it worked great
505	pos	All the other people in the reviews are saying that the scroll wheel is awful and that it spins freely
505	pos	It doesn’t do any of that
505	pos	The scroll whee has an awesome texture and it very smooth
505	pos	Anyways who is going to care about the scroll whee in competitive gaming
505	pos	And the scroll wheel DOES NOT break and spin freely
505	pos	There is a button the top of the mouse that switches between freely spin mode and regular scroll wheel mode
505	pos	The sensor is absolutely amazing and the software is very intuitive
505	pos	You can change the color of the G logo and the dpi lights as well as the function of the buttons
505	pos	The ergonomics of it is amazing
505	pos	I put a comparison of pictures from my mouse to my keyboard and my hand to my keyboard and my hand on my mouse to see the real size because I thought it was much bigger when I ordered it
505	pos	The second you put it in your hand everything changes
505	pos	It comes with weights to put on if you want it heavier or lighter
505	pos	Get this mouse and have your gaming experience changed forever
506	neg	I have come to learn if something is on sale on Amazon, beware
506	neg	It is either an inferior or faulty product
506	neg	I will be seeking a refund for this purchase
506	neg	1/5 for ergonomics, it has a focus button right where my thumbs fingertip is, where i apply pressure to move the mouse
506	neg	So I either have to slide my thumb down from this button which tilts the y axis causing up and down movements to be angle
506	neg	OR let my thumb rest on the button but when I apply pressure to move the mouse it clicks the button and changes the DPI1/5 for gaming
506	neg	Despite keeping the firmware up to date ( an annoying process with bloatware) and despite multiple mouse pads and surfaces
506	neg	The mouse will freeze in place despite moving the mouse hiccuping every few seconds, making some gaming IMPOSSIBLE
506	neg	1/5 quality of material
506	neg	Cheep plastic, the included weights dont help
506	neg	This is the worst mouse I have ever bought
507	neg	I was looking for a replacement mouse and saw an online review for the G502
507	neg	It showed everything I wanted from a gaming mouse so I quickly ordered one from Amazon
507	neg	Out of the box I've had nothing but left click issues with this mouse
507	neg	Looking through the Amazon reviews it appears this is a common issue with the switches Logitech used for this mouse
507	neg	Nearly every left click either hangs and creates a drag command or double clicks
507	neg	This product fails completely at its primary job and it should be avoid completely until Logitech resolves the issues with their products
508	pos	My G
508	pos	Skill Ripjaws mouse finally started having issues
508	pos	I think the cable has a short
508	pos	Lasted a few years
508	pos	I like the idea of being able to add or take weight from the mouse to balance it or make the feel what you want
508	pos	i did dislike the you have to press down on the scroll wheel to use it
509	neg	I like the mouse overall but the left click is breaking
509	neg	It will either double click, not register a click at all, or if your holding it down it stops registering
509	neg	Very frustrating when you trying to play a game where you need to hold the button down or when you need to drag stuff
509	neg	Still have this issue after trying everything out there
509	neg	Update drivers
509	neg	Remove other mouse drivers
509	neg	Update usb drivers, etc
509	neg	Nothing works
509	neg	30 day warranty on products is a ripoff  I have loved Logitech products in the past but i will not EVER be buying again
509	neg	Mouse is pretty much broken after 2 months
509	neg	UPDATE:  Got a replacement from Logitech and after about a week its doing the same thing
509	neg	The problem is intermittent  but makes this mouse the worst mouse i've ever used
509	neg	Avoid it
510	neg	I noticed this issue around a month or two after owning it that the left click was rather defective but the issue was so intermittent at first that I thought it might have been a software issue
510	neg	The issue has become so pronounced now that the mouse is no longer usable and I am past the return period so I am unsure what to do with it
510	neg	I've read that for whatever reason this is a common issue with this model and Logitech has refused to do anything about it
510	neg	Rather disappointed with Logitech, I've generally only had good experiences with their peripherals in the past, and it's a shame that this product is now making me question if I should continue buying their products in the future
511	pos	I use this at work and liked it so much that I bought one for home (light gaming, work)
511	pos	After a year of daily use, the mouse died (it doesn't light up and wouldn't be recognized as a valid USB device in Windows and Mac) while being used as an input device in a USB switch setup
511	pos	I'm not sure whether the frequent switching (essentially unplugging/replugging without the physical stress) hastened its demise, but either way it's hard to be satisfied with more than 3 stars for this price given 1 year of lifespan
512	pos	My last g502 didn't have the RGBs in it but it's practically the same mouse, I will say with or without the weights in the mouse it's REALLY heavy regardless
512	pos	I just can't get away from the unlockable mouse scroll wheel
512	pos	My biggest issues are that when I move this one side to side it's like it's not tight on the inside and shakes a little and also GHUB is a very buggy and power-hungry application
513	pos	Great mouse
513	pos	Already have 2 of them for work and home
513	pos	Perfect value
513	pos	Very satisfied with software
513	pos	RGB is normal, but I’m not a fan of RGB in general
513	pos	DPI settings are just the best
513	pos	Up to 25600
513	pos	Customization is good
513	pos	On my first unit already have a bit of paint scratching on metallic scroll wheel
513	pos	Not an issue with functionality and overall look
513	pos	First mouse purchase after which there’s not even a sense to check for better
513	pos	Value is amazing
513	pos	Bought both units with deals for 40 USD
514	pos	If you aren't aware of the G502, you haven't been listening
514	pos	It's a great corded mouse
514	pos	No issues at all
514	pos	It clicks, it moves, software has been good, never any issues
514	pos	It fits my hand well, I prefer this style of mouse more than others
514	pos	Great mouse
514	pos	The wireless version of the G502, Lightspeed; although more expensive, is just as good
514	pos	I used both
515	pos	Had to play with the settings quite a bit and as it turns out it was not the settings it was the mouse pad I had i have a hard surface mouse pad with wrist thing it made the mouse move all over the place it seems this mouse works best with the soft mouse pads would of been nice to know before I order the other mouse pad but ooh well it works now
516	neg	I don't leave reviews
516	neg	I made an exception for this beautiful piece of hot garbage
516	neg	This mouse started the slow process of dying only 8 months in
516	neg	A new record for me
516	neg	Quite the accomplishment you could say
516	neg	The left mouse button started sticking
516	neg	Now it's a year and a half in and the right mouse button has taken after it's slower brother and is sticking as well
516	neg	The left button has gotten to the point where the mouse isn't really usable anymore
516	neg	Not sure how they managed to regress so much from the G500 which I bought in 2012 and that lasted me SEVEN YEARS
516	neg	Somehow they managed it though
516	neg	Pros: Feels good on your hand
516	neg	Cons: Makes you hate your life after 8 months and you slowly spiral downwards as this mouse continues its inconsistent breaking process over the course of around a year before you finally give up and have to buy a new mouse, the whole while wondering what is wrong with our horrible world
517	neg	I was surprised to find an issue on Logitech mouse as idiotic as the mouse 1 button not functioning properly
517	neg	For being a gaming, mouse, it's infuriating having to click mouse 1 twice or attempting jam the button down and it still not working
517	neg	Im having it replaced and hopefully it won't have the same issue
518	pos	After one week of use, the side buttons along with the other buttons for the mouse started to fail
518	pos	Currently, the only buttons that work are the G5, middle mouse click and both the left and right mouse click
518	pos	The rest are bugging out and either do not register at all or stop midway
518	pos	However, if you’re only using the three main buttons (left, middle, and right mouse click) then you should be fine
518	pos	I’m just a little disappointed Seeing that the buttons failed after a few clicks
518	pos	I didn’t click on the buttons particularly hard and I’ve only started using the G4, right and left middle mouse buttons on the 8th day and it broke on that very same day
518	pos	Edit:I have received a new mouse and this one works fine
518	pos	I've been using it for a year now and this has been the best mouse I have ever owned
518	pos	The fact that you can adjust the weight is a nice touch too
519	pos	Comfortable in my hand
519	pos	I've got large hands, and it really fits two styles of how I grip the mouse
519	pos	The first being sort of a claw shape with my hand, and the second being a more 'palmed' holding of the mouse
519	pos	Either way, the mouse feels great
519	pos	The adjustable weights are a plus, and there is an incredible amount of customization with both the dpi and the inputs for the additional buttons
519	pos	Makes productivity and gaming much more enjoyable
519	pos	RGB is subtle and customizable as well
519	pos	Overall I've really been satisfied with this and I'd totally recommend it for the price point, which for me was about $40
520	neg	I bought it here recently, and at the start it was a good gaming mouse and did the job until I ran into a issue where the left and now right mouse button wont stick down for a extended hold on the buttons
520	neg	Did research and found out this is a manufacture default on the mouse itself
520	neg	Contacted Logitech and at first it was fine they told me within 72 hours we should be sending you a new one out
520	neg	10 days later since that last email
520	neg	Multi calls to product support, three emails to them and they have gone silent no update, nothing and its becoming harder to use the mouse
520	neg	Also do not get me started in the "Software" needed to use this product you can flush it down the toilet
520	neg	Every update I have had to uninstall software and reinstall and reprogram all the buttons to be able to use them
520	neg	I would give this product a 0 out of 5 if I am able to
520	neg	I will update if I ever hear anything back from support but at this time i will tell everyone do not buy this mouse, it sucks
521	neg	I loved this mouse for about 10 months then found out there's a problem with the left mouse button losing functionality over time that many others seem to have found after google searching whats wrong with mine suddenly losing clicks(or sometimes double when it should be a single)
521	neg	Mouse was good, keyword "was
521	neg	" If it had not failed on me this would be a solid top pick from me for gaming
521	neg	I am going to try to crack it open and fix it and if I cant then I'll buy a new mouse and when looking I will think real hard about picking another Logitech mouse after this
521	neg	I'm going to rate it a 2 overall even though I rate the others aspects above a 2 because if you aren't lucky this mouse is going to be a 1 or 2 but if it works for you its a great mouse
521	neg	If it had been more expensive I would rate it a 1, lasting less than a year isn't a good look
522	pos	I've had this mouse for years now, and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 on quality of material is that I recently had to replace it
522	pos	I'm not sure I actually hit the click guarantee, but eventually the mouse started double clicking every so often when I only single clicked
522	pos	It's still my favorite mouse though
522	pos	For medium to large hands, it's super comfy and easy to move around given the customizable weight
523	pos	This is my first nicer gaming mouse
523	pos	I used some cheaper "gaming" mice in the past, but this one is really nice
523	pos	I ended up using all the weights, as I like a little heft to my mice but what's really nice is the ability to customize the weight
523	pos	It works great, custom buttons, speed, etc
523	pos	I'm really pleased with it
524	pos	This is a great gaming mouse even just from plugging it in
524	pos	Within seconds it was easy to understand how it works
524	pos	For some reason downloading the Mouse setup online messed with the DPI changing button but after playing with it I was able to fix it and now I get to enjoy the move speed I actually care about
524	pos	Just in case you also had the issue, in the Logitech G Hub simply click the mouse, then under Assignments go to the System tab and you can drag and drop DPI Cycle onto the appropriate button
524	pos	The buttons on the side are great to have too, especially since I am practicing for when I get a 60% keyboard
524	pos	Overall great mouse both in and out of games
525	neg	The mouse was great for a while
525	neg	Feels good in the hand, slides well, removable weights, enough extra buttons, nice design
525	neg	But none of that matters when the left click starts registering multiple clicks
525	neg	The usability of the mouse plummets when basic navigation becomes frustrating
525	neg	I have not yet submitted a support case with logitech but I plan to
526	pos	This is a great mouse with all sorts of buttons and glides smooth
526	pos	The information that comes with it is very lacking
526	pos	It gives you a website to go to but you stumble around to find what you are looking for
526	pos	You need a program from said site to adjust the settings
526	pos	This mouse is not for me however
526	pos	Nothing to do with quality or how it basically works, it’s just that this mouse is for a palm user and I am more of a finger hybrid user
526	pos	My old mouse was smaller and that’s probably how I got used to finger over palm
527	pos	Pros: Basically everything
527	pos	Great response time, great customization for mouse functions, feels great in the hand, all around great
527	pos	I love how it looks, I love it in almost every way, so just because the cons list is longer, doesn't mean its not an incredible mouse
527	pos	Cons: Two cons: 1
527	pos	The weights fit very tightly in both the mouse and the case, and they're kind of annoying to put in and take out
527	pos	2
527	pos	The RGB customization is not that great
527	pos	You can only do 3 effects, one of which you have no choice of colors, but RGB is probably the least important part of the mouse, so not a bug deal
527	pos	And one issue that I think was just because mine was a bit faulty, the color of the RGB is off
527	pos	When I set it to white (R255 G255 B255) it appears blueish green
527	pos	to make it look white, I have to set it to R255 G160 B160, and then it looks like a perfect white
527	pos	So I think the red lighting is weak, so I gets overpowered by the Green and blue
527	pos	Another example of this is when I set it to yellow, it appears green with a tint of yellow
527	pos	Keep in mind, the cons were just minor things
527	pos	Weights fitting weird, slight RGB issues, etc
527	pos	are not big things, don't let them keep you from buying this mouse
527	pos	This is an incredible product, I've tried other mice, and I would always go with the G502 series without hesitation, and they are by far the most comfortable mice I've ever held
527	pos	And with this many buttons, you would think that some of them would be really annoying to press, right
527	pos	Nope
527	pos	A couple are a little uncomfortable, but at least 10 are quite easy and comfortable to press
527	pos	There's a reason that the G502 series is so popular, after all
527	pos	The best mouse you can buy for under $100 in my opinion
528	neg	Avoid this mouse for gaming
528	neg	It has a defect with the scroll wheel that will have you constantly switching weapons in games like Call of Duty Warzone
528	neg	It’s super annoying and unusable
528	neg	Check the internet this is a common issues for this mouse
528	neg	Wish I’d done more research before buying
529	pos	After having a Magic Eagle mouse for about 5 years, I replaced it with this
529	pos	I am a PC gamer, but didn't want all the fancy bells and whistles that come with others
529	pos	Whereas this does have weights to help with controllability, I found that using it straight of the box as it, was perfect
529	pos	It has excellent response time (I usually play snipers) and the DPI is customizable
529	pos	If you use the Logitech software, you can customize the colors with it to match your set up with no problem
529	pos	It fits comfortably in my hand, which is much needed as I am usually at the PC for a good chunk of my day for work and gaming
530	pos	After a coworker of mine had suggested that I try utilizing a keyboard and mouse set up for Call of Duty on the xbox, I decided to give it a go since my entry into 1st person shooters started years ago on a pc
530	pos	I will say that I absolutely love the ergonomics and feel of this mouse, as well as its sensitivity and customization abilities as far as button mapping is concerned, which is ridiculously easy with the Call of Duty interface
531	neg	If you only had 3 fingers this mouse is great
531	neg	But unfortunately i have 5 and this mouse isn't built for that
531	neg	I searched for "large gaming mouse" since it seems everything is made for children's hands
531	neg	Alas I saw reviews saying this mouse was huge and great for big hands, but I was fooled
531	neg	It is in fact a regular size mouse
531	neg	I've used logitech mice for 20 years or so, I can't remember because I'm old; but I cannot find a mouse to fit my hands
531	neg	If you have big hands, this is not the mouse for you
532	pos	It might be this specific model, it might be the average of this model, but the sensor will malfunction here and there, making a character look straight up and spin in a circle
532	pos	It's very frustrating, and not something I've dealt with in Logitech mice before
532	pos	I had a proteous spectrum that had click issues in it's later life, but I know I am the cause for that
532	pos	This issue started as soon as I got it, and still does
532	pos	Otherwise, I love the button configuration and have loved them for years
533	pos	I went through 2 Razer Mambas in less than 2 years
533	pos	First one had the grips starting to fall off in about a year
533	pos	RMA'd it and the 2nd had the same problem within a year
533	pos	I liked the feel, but wanted to hopefully get something better from them (and keep my keyboard/mouse Razer)
533	pos	Bought a Naga Trinity
533	pos	Larger, and took a week or so to get used to, but had some nice sideplates
533	pos	In LESS THAN A YEAR, it was double clicking with a single click or unable to drag without it releasing by itself
533	pos	Finally gave up and switched to this via advice from a friend
533	pos	This guy gives you the feel of the Razer Mamba (and way better than the Trinity), without (at least so far) double clicking or grip pad issues
533	pos	Perfect fit for my hand/grip just like the Mamba, customizable buttons that, unless you have big hands, you won't hit accidentally
533	pos	Will update if it decides to do the double-clicking issue like the Razer Trinity did or grip pads falling off like the Mamba
534	pos	This mouse fits my very average sized hands well with a claw type grip
534	pos	The inside and outside of this mouse has rubberized grips that enhance traction
534	pos	It also has excellent tracking and works really well for every game I use it with
534	pos	I honestly could care less about the lighting, but it is customizable and looks cool, I guess
534	pos	The scroll wheel has a nice solid "click" to it, and that can be turned off to allow infinite scrolling
534	pos	If you need a gaming mouse, here it is
535	pos	Is a Shame leave a bad review about thus mouse because I love this mouse while ir lasted, Is very funcional, ergonomic and love  His desing but I'm have to be honest, if you want a durable mouse for daily gaming dont buy this mouse, I bough this mouse 7 months ago and actually, right and left click stopped working, I have a chinese and cheap mouse  2 years ago, and still working like firts day, ir a Shame this Logitech, whit that price, and popular didnt last 8 months, I'm very dissapointed with this mouse, Gonna buy Corsair mouse could be better than this trash
536	neg	Once I got past the mouse driver needing to have access to *record my screen* (it didn't function without it
536	neg	) just to set up the muse profiles, I was able to store the profiles on the mouse itself and delete the software
536	neg	I was then reasonably happy with it up until it started not registering the thumb buttons (forward/back in the browser) reliably
536	neg	Then it got worse: now they don't work at all, and I have to cycle through the profiles on the mouse just to get any buttons to work at all (I think because the computer thinks the forward/back buttons are just being pressed all the time, so it doesn't even register the normal left/right buttons)
536	neg	Maybe I just got a bad one, this replaced another Logitech mouse that I'd had for over 5 years, but not even getting a year out of this one is terrible
537	neg	The mouse has had lighting issues since day one but I like the mouse so I disabled that and have been enjoying it
537	neg	Less than 4 months of use and it is now totally dead
537	neg	Logitech used to be a brand that would last years in the most abused situations, not die from light use
537	neg	I hope this isn’t a sign of where their brand is going
537	neg	I see a lot of other people with this same complaint of dead mouse after a few months
538	pos	This is a good mouse it feels nice and the programmable buttons are very nice to use for everyday work and also for gaming for buttons that are to reach on a keyboard when you are a gaming
538	pos	The software is good also a lot of people complain about it but for me it isn't to bad
538	pos	The mis-clicks I found true though it was not the left button it for me the two buttons next to the right button
538	pos	But I fixed it easy just unbinded them and it was problem fixed
539	neg	I've owned this mouse since October, it's now the end of May
539	neg	After seven full months of use, the left mouse button is double clicking and not holding when drag/drop is needed
539	neg	Apparently it's a common issue with this mouse
539	neg	I love the thumb buttons but would not repurchase due to lack of longevity
539	neg	Not like this is a cheap mouse
539	neg	Edit: After my initial issue in May, it started working (mostly) properly
539	neg	Now, in the end of July, it's double clicking way more often than it did in May
539	neg	Logitech has unrealistic hoops to jump through to get a refund/replacement
539	neg	I ordered a Razer mouse, will recycle this garbage
540	neg	I liked this mouse until it started doing this
540	neg	In instances where extended holding of one of the mouse buttons ( drag or drag-and-drop operations ), the mouse will begin throwing out multiple click events
540	neg	This is pretty upsetting when you're expecting to be able to drag a thing from a place and then suddenly your dude stops doing that because the game thinks you clicked the mouse again
540	neg	Considering this is a GAMING mouse meant for GAMING, this should not be a thing that is happening after just over a year of use
540	neg	It suggests poor workmanship or poor quality materials
540	neg	Or both
540	neg	The thing that is most upsetting is that this is not an uncommon issue
540	neg	I've searched on Google and found many posts about this exact same thing
540	neg	So if you do a lot stuff that requires you to hold down a mouse button, this is definitely not the product for you, unless you like replacing your mouse after a year
540	neg	Maybe the warranty is still good and I can get a refund for a more robust mouse
541	neg	This is the second G502 HERO mouse I've bought, the first one had a double click issue that started only 2 months after I bought it, so I went out and bought a new one locally
541	neg	I wanted to give it another chance because so many of my friends recommended it to me
541	neg	now the second one can't hold left click down for very long before it releases for a fraction of a second
541	neg	every time I try and drag and drop a window or folder it gets dropped half way
541	neg	Its very infuriating especially for someone who works from home on computers as well as games on computers
541	neg	From what I heard the newer models of this mouse has new cheaper mouse triggers that cause these issues
541	neg	You can see plenty of other people complaining about the clicking issues these mice had
542	neg	I bought this mouse last october
542	neg	In the past month I've been experiencing whenever I left click to drag a file or highlight something, it thinks I'm double clicking so it opens the file or lets go of highlighting
542	neg	When I click to play or pause a youtube video, it thinks I'm double clicking so it will full screen the video
542	neg	I use Adobe photoshop and premiere pro to edit my videos
542	neg	It is very annoying dealing with this double clicking
542	neg	After further researching this issue, I find out this is a common thing to have on this model in due time
542	neg	Video reviews won't mention this because they haven't used this mouse for months
542	neg	Wow Logitech
542	neg	I've always used logitech brand mice throughout my life and I've never seen this issue before, much less an issue at all within a couple months of purchase
542	neg	Logitech really dropped the ball
543	pos	Love my Logitech G602, but was looking to replace it with a wired version with some higher DPIs
543	pos	I tried to "get used to" the G502 for a week, but I'm giving up
543	pos	Biggest problem is how stiff the scroll wheel button is to click, combined with having to avoid hitting the side-to-side button clicks on the scroll wheel - annoying
543	pos	The other problem is with the radical undercut on the front of the mouse - when clicking and dragging I was causing the back of the mouse to lift up, then when I'd release it would drop down again which moved the mouse placement and the thing I was dragging would get "dropped" in the wrong place
543	pos	I managed to train myself to use a lighter touch after a few days, but it was an annoying few days
544	neg	Logitech is usually my go to in terms of peripherals
544	neg	However after owning this mouse for about 21 days
544	neg	I’d have to reconsider my options
544	neg	After 2 weeks, the mouse started to become non responsive
544	neg	The mouse arrow on my screen would stray downwards by itself
544	neg	The mouse itself would freeze
544	neg	The lights would shut off, andAfter numerous attempts to fix it I opted to return the mouse
544	neg	I tested this on another desktop and laptop
544	neg	Uninstalled, reinstalled, updated software, swapped USB ports, ran SFC and DISM to no avail
544	neg	Going from a G602 which I used for years, I’m a bit disappointed
544	neg	The reason in replaced it, was due to several years of use, the 602 started to have the notorious double click bug
544	neg	Be weary
545	pos	I don't understand whether or not you know there is a button right behind the scroll lock that enables or disables the scroll "locking" feature
545	pos	I have had mine for a year now and I can happily say this is the best mouse for gaming and computing that I have ever owned
545	pos	The scroll lock still works like a clock
546	pos	What can you say
546	pos	Probably the best wired gaming mouse out there
546	pos	I use it solely with fingertip grip and it's perfect
546	pos	Use it at both home and work
546	pos	Love the metal scroll wheel with either standard scrolling or freescrolling
546	pos	Software is pretty good
546	pos	Only thing I noticed was the scroll wheel wobbles a bit side to side if you quickly move the mouse side to side in a wiggling motion
546	pos	Doesn't seem to have any impact on operation and occurs rarely
547	neg	I have to left click hard in order for the mouse to register a click now
547	neg	I thought it was something wrong with my computer since right click was working fine until i randomly clicked hard on left click and it registered a click then i realized it was the mouse
547	neg	I bought sliders and grips for the mouse, im sad it broke
548	neg	I bought this mouse in December 2019
548	neg	Around February or March I noticed that during games my mouse would seem like it would double right click
548	neg	I didn't think about it until recently when it is now double clicking every other time or 3-4 times in a row
548	neg	I looked it up and this is a common problem with this mouse
548	neg	I have tried moving USB slots, updating firmware, re-installing driver, and cleaning mouse with air can
548	neg	I think this is just defective but I am outside of the return window
548	neg	If you are looking for mice, I cannot recommend this one
549	neg	The web blogs are true
549	neg	There is a left click problem with this one
549	neg	Sometimes it doesn't even work
549	neg	You have to use it in combination with the right click button
549	neg	Not consistent
549	neg	My $10 mouse is still reliable
549	neg	So disappointed
549	neg	Maybe it really is for a gaming pc only, not for use with a mini pc
550	pos	I would give this mouse a perfect score if it weren't for G-hub
550	pos	The application for controlling the mouse isn't very well done and has multiple issues
550	pos	Otherwise the mouse is great
550	pos	It's comfortable in the hands
550	pos	Adjustable weights are very nice and evenly distribute the weight based on where you put them
550	pos	(I have small hands and usually use a heavier mouse) I'm happy the mouse had options on it
550	pos	The buttons on the mouse itself are completely programmable to the extent you can even remap left and right click to something else
550	pos	(Don't know why you would unless you were running scripts for those keys but I digress
550	pos	) Buttons are clicky and feel descent quality
550	pos	(I use mechanical keys on my keyboard and the mouse seems to have a similar activation on it's side buttons to my otomu blue keys) The left and right click are light actuation points which is great for shooter games where who clicks first has a high degree of importance
550	pos	Overall can't fault the mouse just wish the software for it were better
551	neg	Driver doesn't recognize device after first update
551	neg	Without a functional driver this device is just a worthless piece of plastic
551	neg	I came from razer after experiencing the same problem with them
551	neg	Countless hours wasted troubleshooting to no avail
551	neg	Also the scroll wheel button doesn't work because they added buttons on either side of it, which you have to lean to activate, so when you try to push the scroll wheel button down it will just fall to one side and push something you didn't want to
551	neg	So don't expect to use that
551	neg	The button furthest back on the mouse near your palm, is too far back to reach comfortably
551	neg	So realistically this mouse has 9 functional buttons
551	neg	Which is still pretty good, but I wasn't impressed with GHUB before it stopped working, and now I can't use it at all
552	neg	All the other reviews about the mouse button double-clicking are NOT exaggerating
552	neg	If anything, they undersell the problem
552	neg	It started off as a rare occurrence, but over time became an issue for about 50% of clicking
552	neg	It WILL mess you up with everything like gaming, starting/pausing a video, and you can forget about clicking and dragging anything in peace
552	neg	Everything else about the mouse is awesome, but if a mouse can't even get the main function of all mice since their creation, what is it really good for
552	neg	How does a company let a problem like this happen, and for SO LONG
552	neg	The "firmware fix" that was supposed to resolve this issue did nothing
552	neg	I put up with this mouse for over a year now because I really liked how it felt, but the error ratio has steadily increased to beyond occasional frustration
552	neg	Save your money and look elsewhere
553	neg	This mouse is EXTREMELY overrated
553	neg	The weight is distributed horribly and it is INCREDIBLY SMALL
553	neg	If you are over 6 feet, chances are you or hands will engulf this uncomfortably
553	neg	My biggest grievance is the AWFUL MOUSE WHEEL
553	neg	I don't know why reviews are mentioning this but it is unusable
553	neg	It spins like crazy and can't be controlled
553	neg	It's so loose just moving your mouse quickly will cause it to spin
553	neg	The bottom of the mouse has a latch than can be removed so you can insert weights to make the mouse heavy, and its horrible
553	neg	Always comes off and the rubber is already peeling
553	neg	It's obvious the company pays Amazon to push this mouse to the top of searches
553	neg	AVOID MOUSE
554	neg	Total piece of junk
554	neg	Just like every other Logitech product in the last few years that I have been burned by
554	neg	Double clicking issue, no need for me to go in to it, just google / bing / what ever you use to find the wide spread issue, and their support was a total joke that makes you jump though hoops for everything under the sun that isn't related to the issue
554	neg	Purchased a Corsair wireless mouse ( the harpoon ) and haven't looked back
554	neg	Save your time and money, look past the marketing and google this mouse's issues before wasting your hard earned money
555	neg	This issue appeared a few days after I got it
555	neg	But it wasn't too bad, the issues appeared to be if you release your right-click slowly it will click it multiple times
555	neg	It works fine if you just hold it with normal force
555	neg	However, it will grow worse over time
555	neg	Now this game has made some fps (right-click to zoom) or wow(right-click to turn camera) literally unplayable after only 4 months of use
555	neg	By the time this issue has occurred to me, I have also done a little research, apparently, this is a very common issue with the G502 model
555	neg	I didn't find this issue affect MOBA too much, it still clicks, but anything requires you holding down the right-click button this would not be the ideal choice
555	neg	*Update: It's pretty easy to get support from their website, and they will send you another one shortly after its approved
555	neg	But this issue seems like a design flaw because the new one is starting to broke down as well
555	neg	Since I really like this mouse, I just bought two of them, and when one broke down and just switch to another one and open a ticket
555	neg	Its a shame, I wish they can release a fixed version
556	pos	Todo en este ratón es lo mejor, pero no se puede decir lo mismo del software, tiene bugs, a veces cuando se actualiza, se queda eternamente actualizando, haciendo que tenga que reiniciar de nuevo mi PC para que se actualice la aplicación, deberían poner mas efectos del RGB (LIGHTSYNC)
556	pos	pero el ratón en si esta bien
557	neg	Bought to replace a non functional old Deathadder
557	neg	Slightly less ergonomic, has more buttons, too big for my tiny hands
557	neg	Would buy again if it continues to function
557	neg	Review score lowered
557	neg	Only a few months in and the RMB is now suffering from the apparently infamous double click problem
557	neg	Double update
557	neg	I got a replacement from Logitech fairly easily but the replacement has the same problem on two different buttons
557	neg	It's pretty unfortunate and makes the product essentially unusable
557	neg	Currently looking for another mouse, do not buy
558	neg	It works but the software is junk
558	neg	The software keeps opening in some huge screen font and does not match your screen settings
558	neg	It was a pain to figure out to simply save the setting's and not have to redo them after every boot
558	neg	Too bad, the mouse is acceptable, the software is a mess
559	pos	This product have a really nice design, I like the quality they used on it, this mouse have a lot of programmable buttons
559	pos	What's also nice about this gaming mouse is that there's weights you can add and or remove
559	pos	That's something unique specifically for this mouse because there's not really a lot of mouses out there that can do that
559	pos	So you can change this mouse whether you like to feel a bit of heavy, or if you want it to be really light
559	pos	There is this one feature on the side of the mouse, it basically changes the DPI speed when you press and hold on it, which also counts as a programmable button by the way, that button might be problematic as you might click it with your thumb on accident
559	pos	Best way to work around it is either program it to something else or disable it
560	pos	I honestly almost returned it after a few rounds of Overwatch because the wheel was just freely spinning like WoW wHaT hIgH qUaLiTy but no, I'm dumb, there's a button right behind the wheel that toggles free spin
560	pos	Feels great, I wear a size L glove
560	pos	Weight is adjustable in case you want to weeb out and have it at precisely x grams instead of whatever it is now
560	pos	I wasn't sure about the button placement but after a few minutes they make a lot of sense and i don't have to adjust my hand to hit any of them
560	pos	Theres also a DPI indicator light which is shockingly handy when switching between several settings
560	pos	Bad news now is if you miss
560	pos	its not the mouse
561	pos	Great mouse
561	pos	One thing that got me was that the wheel has a button for free spin
561	pos	When it was set to free spin and not click like a normal wheel, I'd move the mouse and the wheel would spin slightly just enough to scroll a little bit, or switch my weapon in call of duty
561	pos	Pushed the button for free scroll just below the wheel and it did the trick
562	neg	The right click button feels as if it's worn out
562	neg	It does not have a distinct down-click like the left click does
562	neg	Plus, ITS A USED MOUSE
562	neg	WTH Amazon
562	neg	Why do you ship used crap
562	neg	I spent nearly 2 hours in chat support arguing with the reps for a SIMPLE QR CODE to return it
562	neg	I'm tired of buying garbage used, damaged, defective, manufacturer screwed up devices that are advertised as new
562	neg	Every single order I get used, damaged crap and I have to screw around for a return
562	neg	Reporting criminal practices to the FTC
563	neg	Video Player is loading

563	neg	I mean, right out of the box two lights aren't working
563	neg	Luckily I bought a 4 year protection plan so asurion can look forward to all of the replacements since Logitech can't maintain quality in their production
564	pos	I must startby I love this mouse when it was working
564	pos	After only a few months and limited play on D2 my left and right mouse buttons aren't registering, switches died
564	pos	I filed a warranty claim weeks ago and convenient get it's out of stock on the warranty side but I can buy a brand new one from them no problems
564	pos	I was excited to buy logitech but after this will not any longer
564	pos	Maybe my experience is a one off but I hate when prior customers get the shaft for new ones
565	pos	I got this mouse after being fed up with my cheap o wireless mouse having dead batteries frequently and poor connection more often than acceptable
565	pos	Wow, this mouse is really a great improvement
565	pos	Feels great in my hand, very responsive, great for the games I play, many different buttons to click and program
565	pos	Even has extra weights you can attach to make it heavier
565	pos	I do recommend
566	pos	This is the first quality mouse, i've ever owned
566	pos	Compared to all my other mouses, mice, mouse plural, It's like night and day
566	pos	PRO: joy to use
566	pos	solid, heavy, a criteria we people over 30 enjoy
566	pos	CON: it's not greatly ergonomic, and i'm sure this isn't the best mouse, but as a start into the area of quality, it is good
566	pos	if it breaks within a year, i'm giving it a 1 star
566	pos	but so far it is ok
566	pos	I am a game developer and 3d modeler and youtuber the edits my own videos
566	pos	I actually kept it in the box waiting for my new computer, but the graphics card crash where there's none to be found has delayed it
566	pos	So i broke it out and put it on my laptop
566	pos	I much needed joy to use
566	pos	my laptop is horrible
567	pos	You have to download G Hub to change stuff like the LED logo color, the default is a fading rainbow light
567	pos	Every time I restart my computer it resets everything
567	pos	I have to go in to G Hub every time to change it
567	pos	The mouse's middle button/wheel feels really weird, almost clunky and a bit noisy
567	pos	The weights are ok
568	pos	I just switched from Xbox to PC and this was the first mouse I purchased
568	pos	I knew I was gonna struggle with finding all the keys so I wanted a mouse that had enough extra buttons to help me
568	pos	It definitely has helped a lot
568	pos	The placement of them is great
568	pos	I also love how you can add weights
568	pos	The braiding cable is very nice
568	pos	The only negative I have found is the RGB lights kind of stink but I didn’t buy it bc of the RGB, I bought it for every other reason
569	pos	I bought this because it is supposed to be good for people with larger hands
569	pos	Its size is about the same as other mice, so thats a bust
569	pos	Out of the box the wheel feels like its too close to the palm of my hand
569	pos	The click/no-click feature on the wheel is nice
569	pos	The weights seem a bit iffy in placement
569	pos	I'll update after I have some use-time on it
570	pos	This mouse is pretty cool
570	pos	I do not use it for gaming, but rather for work (using a cad software)
570	pos	The mouse buttons are completely customizable and uses a Logitech application for easy customization
570	pos	It does get caught up small crumbs on my desk, but I haven’t seen a mouse that doesn’t
570	pos	My favorite feature by far is the unlocking scroll wheel
570	pos	This feature has really come in handy when scrolling in and out of projects for an easier view
571	pos	This is my second one
571	pos	the first lasted somewhere right around three years until the toddler decided to beat it up one day and then it started clicking weird
571	pos	So I bought another one
571	pos	It's hard to find a gaming mouse for smaller hands, but this one accommodates and works well with a fingertip grip style
572	neg	Are you kidding me
572	neg	It came without the weights
572	neg	Like, it's one of the main features of this mouse and it came without them
572	neg	And on top of that it looks used
572	neg	I can totally tell by the bottom glides
572	neg	Come on man
572	neg	>:(Review update: I just researched a bit more and I can now confirm that it is a used mouse
572	neg	I watch an unboxing video and it's supposed to come with a semi hard plastic wrap protection AND THE MANUAL of course, guess what, mine didn'tcome with any of that, it was just the bare mouse inside the box
572	neg	Complete scam
573	neg	Always seemed to have an issue where any variation of pressure on the left click and hold of the left mouse button would cause the button to reclick causing problem with selecting text
573	neg	Support had me troubleshoot and then blamed Microsoft
573	neg	Using a different mouse now
573	neg	Problem got worse just after the warranty period
573	neg	I see lots of complaints about the micro switches regarding these mice
573	neg	I would recommend you not buy this one, or if you do once you notice the issue start to happen submit a warranty claim
574	pos	I play about 10hrs a week on average,  so kind of casual gamer
574	pos	I needed something with more buttons for Outriders and Destiny 2
574	pos	The one bummer is the program that is for button configuration is super tiny, like minuscule,  on my laptop screen and as far as I can tell it can't be adjusted
574	pos	Hard it see what I'm keying in
575	pos	The mouse is very good
575	pos	It has good build quality, good sensor, and an excellent scroll wheel
575	pos	But, after using it for one day, the blue light turned very pale blue and it is almost white
575	pos	I am on a Chromebook, so I can not change the color of the light to be a different color, because Logitech G Hub is only for Windows and Mac
576	neg	I bought this mouse about six months ago and overall I was pretty content with it at first
576	neg	The build quality seems good, the rubberized grips on the sides are nice, no issues with registration of movement, no issues of cable fraying and no issues with MOST of the buttons
576	neg	The biggest problem is that the button that DOES have an issue is the most important one: The Left-Click button
576	neg	As of the past two months I intermittently (and more frequently) encounter an issue when trying to left-click or hold left-click, the mouse registers several left-clicks in rapid succession
576	neg	You can only imagine how incredibly aggravating that is from a gameplay perspective down to something as simple as trying to drag a window across my screen only to have it drop the window and open a bunch of new tabs and randomly select everything
576	neg	It's a shame because I know many people who speak very highly of this mouse, but little did I know that this is actually a common issue that I must have overlooked when researching this mouse
576	neg	After looking into it, it seems like there are a lot of people who have reported this issue which makes me question if RMA'ing will even solve the problem or just prolong the inevitable
576	neg	I really wanted to rate this mouse much higher but because of this one critical issue with arguably the most important function of any mouse, I simply can't
577	pos	Size wise it's a tad small compared to my corsair
577	pos	The extra buttons are positioned in spots where you normally rest your finger so prepare for accidental clicks
577	pos	My chief complaint is the wheel, the dpi on that is insane, and it's sensitivity is way off simultaneously too slow and too fast
577	pos	the added bonus of course is any pressure at all will make it spin forever
577	pos	I'd keep shopping
578	pos	I honestly never thought I'd need to spend over $40 on a mouse
578	pos	The Hero has proven me wrong
578	pos	I truly did not understand how poor the mouse I had for about 4 years, which I had also bought off Amazon, had been treating me until I held the Hero in my hands
578	pos	I personally use 2 of the weights, one on the back and one on the front
578	pos	This makes moving the mouse side to side a breeze, and moving it up and down take just a few grams more effort, which is ideal for shooters and other games
578	pos	My $6 mouse functioned fine, and still does, but does not have the tactile feel, profile options, macro abilities, and even the DPI settings that it have just don't feel nearly as good as the Hero does
578	pos	Overall, would and probably will buy again
579	pos	This is a great gaming mouse
579	pos	The 25k dpi sensor is really nice to use
579	pos	Keep this in mind though, I have a Razer Basilisk V1, that was my daily driver before this
579	pos	The Razer Basilisk has a 16k sensor, there was little difference but it was not really noticeable
579	pos	(I am also not an extreme gamer, people who are professional/enthusiast gamers might notice a difference in speed)
580	pos	This mouse is honestly great
580	pos	The feel of it, the looks, and the smoothness of it, I’m just glad this exists
580	pos	The only think bad is that I sometimes bump the two buttons near the left click
580	pos	I had to Disable those two buttons in G hub
580	pos	I think that’s what it’s called
580	pos	I had them set to change dpi (which wasn’t a good idea in the first place) but quickly had to disable them
580	pos	Right now, I don’t have any problems with it
580	pos	Idk if there’s a placebo effect but I’m doing better in my Overwatch games
580	pos	Who knows
580	pos	Maybe I’ll finally hit Grandmaster again
581	neg	Both switches failed after few months and now randomly double clicking and cannot drag and drop
581	neg	I have cheap mice working for years and never had this issue
582	pos	I really like this one
582	pos	It's my second one as I wore out the first one
582	pos	Wore out the texture of the grip and finally wore out the scroll wheel on the first one
582	pos	I like the adjustable weights, I like a heavy mouse
583	neg	I play games at a competetive level
583	neg	As a woman, I also have small hands and need a smaller mouse
583	neg	This is a bit big, but it's very useable in terms of size
583	neg	However, it is absolutely awful
583	neg	It double clicks over 50% of the time on it's own
583	neg	I've tried and tried to look at calibrating it and adjusting the speed and such, but nothing fixes this
583	neg	It's unusable like this
583	neg	I can't even highlight text or use it in office applications, much less for games
583	neg	I really wanted it to work well, too
584	neg	If you want a mouse that is super comfortable but dies after 4 months, then this is the mouse for you
584	neg	A chronic problem that has plagued this version of Logitech mice since the g500 is still a thing
584	neg	After about 4 months the switch for the right or left click goes bad (it's seemingly random, in my case it was left click)
584	neg	When it goes bad it will randomly double click
584	neg	This means simple tasks like drag and drop are impossible
585	pos	I don't know why, but the product I got from Amazon was so much better than the faulty one I got from Logitech's actual website
585	pos	Very responsive and the right mb ACTUALLY WORKS PROPERLY
585	pos	It's a bit too large for my hands, but I got used to it over time
585	pos	What's important for me is the functional support that the buttons have since they're great for mmos and general desk work efficiency
585	pos	The buttons are placed comfortably so you can reach them without difficulty, and you naturally form muscle memory on their location over time
585	pos	I legit can't go back to regular mice because it's made work and gaming SO flippin easy and comfy
585	pos	Wonderful product
585	pos	Try to get this on sale whenever possible
586	pos	I bought this to replace a cheap mouse bundled in with a prebuilt PC and it has exceeded my expectations for the price
586	pos	The side button and multiple sensitivity settings make all the difference when gaming
586	pos	In Gears 5 my side buttons are set to melee and sniper zoom, and in Warzone they're set to crouch/prone
586	pos	These key binds greatly alleviated hand cramping from having to move my thumb and pinky finger below the movement keys and helped smooth out movement in intense firefights
586	pos	Also worth mentioning that the build quality is nice
586	pos	It feels very sturdy unlike the supplied mouse I did away with
587	pos	Had to get a new mouse after my g303 bit the dust, and this one was recommended to me
587	pos	So far it works very well, and it fits wonderfully in my hand
587	pos	I haven't tried the little weights it comes with, but it's a neat feature nonetheless
587	pos	Note to anyone buying this, the driver link supplied in the user manual no longer works
587	pos	You'll need to download the G-Hub software from Logitech's site, that seems to be their all-purpose driver software for newer products
588	neg	I have a regular Logitech g502 and its working great still just rubber is wearing out
588	neg	but I purchased this hero to replace my g502(non hero) and 10 minutes later im using my old 502 again after trying this I don't know if they sold me a lemon or defective unit because it has never worked properly even with software download it double clicks all time when I want to single slick and I try to drag anything and it goes berserk clicking and opening other tabs
588	neg	should have returned it but im lazy and threw box out thinking that it would just work fine like old model
588	neg	so good luck if u buy this maybe I just got a bad one
588	neg	guess it could happen
589	neg	This mouse is okay if you won’t use the wheel
589	neg	It’s either to hard to turn quickly or you hit the “release” to make it smooth and it rolls back a click or two when you stop it
589	neg	The wheel button is just as bad
589	neg	If you just press down naturally, it mostly doesn’t take the click even though you hear and feel a click
589	neg	You have to push down slightly inward toward your palm
589	neg	Then it’s a different click that actually works
589	neg	Been gaming for decades and bought this for my work PC which i use for gaming while I wait for traffic to die down (is almost as good as my home gaming rig)
589	neg	Gonna have to get a different one
589	neg	Other than the wheel, it’s a tad small but is comfortable enough for 8 hours of PC work
589	neg	Slides good
589	neg	Good for the low cost if you don’t need the wheel
590	pos	Pros: for gaming, ergonomic, good quality, modifiable with the 5 included 3
590	pos	6 g weights, color changing button, scroll button lock/unlockCons: lights flash all the time, not for large hands (I have to bend my fingers to hit the curious buttons because my hand is bigger than the mouse)
591	pos	I've had this mouse for 1 yr and 2 months with about 6-10 hrs of use on weekdays and 12-18 hrs of use on weekends for both browsing and gaming (1st person shooters + MMOs)
591	pos	It still looks and works perfectly as on day 1
591	pos	- I absolutely love the left/right tilt on the scroll wheel, which works even for going back/forward a page while browsing or fast forwarding/rewinding a video
591	pos	- Easy to clean with no dead skin cell buildup on the rubber parts (just wipe it down every other week)
591	pos	The only con is my thumb can't reach the side button very well, but then again, I use a palm grip with half my palm on the desk
592	pos	Looks and feels great
592	pos	The scroll wheel was very smooth, but not quite as smooth as the MX Master
592	pos	Very aggressive look which comes with tons of features while still having flawless ergonomics
592	pos	I would recommend this mouse to anyone that needs a wireless gaming mouse
592	pos	The button to slow dpi is also very useful and if not you can change it to whatever you need it to be
593	pos	This mouse is really really awesome, it's pricey for a mouse but if you're a programmer, gamer or someone else who uses a computer for a long time it's WELL worth the price
593	pos	I love the adjustable weighting, it's large and feels very well made
593	pos	All the buttons are remappable, and the metal scroll wheel is just so much fun
593	pos	I bought a 2nd one for my desktop at my mom's, and considering getting a wireless one for my laptop
594	pos	I have had 2 of these and after about 6 months to a year they just start to double click or do whatever it wants to do
594	pos	I know buy Razor and have very little or no problem with them for only a few $ more
595	neg	I had the older 502's and used them for years, loved them never issue
595	neg	Had to replace after a few years because of mouse feet and rubber grip being chewed by thumb, no big deal
595	neg	I upgraded to 502 Hero
595	neg	I played a TON of FPS, thousands and thousands of hours over the last decade
595	neg	Anyway right clicking eventually failed and you cannot hold it down
595	neg	Aiming down sights or clicking and dragging is impossible
595	neg	This occurred after about 3 months of use
595	neg	I went on to buy 3 total of these mice, replacing them every few months because the same critical right clicking failure would resurface after 2-4 months
595	neg	I got one in March and its already ruined and unusable
595	neg	Cannot play any games or even perform basic functions
595	neg	I would stay FAR away from this mouse as its lifespan is a few months
595	neg	I have finally made the switch to a new brand and likely wont return
595	neg	This is truly pathetic from a company that used to be one of the best in the industry; incredibly disappointing
596	pos	You cannot go wrong with this mouse if you are used to a bit heavy mice
596	pos	Allows varying dpi's adjustable as per your requirements
596	pos	Extra buttons on the mouse for back and forward functions
596	pos	And additional clickable keys on the side for gaming
596	pos	Using it for csgo and looks cool with its rgb
596	pos	My favorite is the scroll as its quite accurate compared my old mouse was quite irritating
597	pos	This mouse is amazing, basically it’s the only mouse you need when you want to improve your gaming skills
597	pos	Takes time to adjust your sensitivity (dpi) but when you get it in the right settings ñ, you’ll destroy your enemy with breathtaking flicks onto their heads
597	pos	Headshots if you didn’t get that
597	pos	Now you need to download Logitech’s app for the mouse configurations, also color customizable
597	pos	Comfortable and slickA lot of buttons where you can also customize and make shortcuts with one click on your mouseThis mouse is worth it, it’s all I can say
598	pos	Son loves all things it can do
598	pos	I used it once when I needed to borrow his pc and it was comfortable and I have small hands
598	pos	He says it’s comfortable and has much bigger hands
598	pos	It has a lot of options like weights you can add to the bottom if you want a heavier mouse
598	pos	I just need a mouse that I can point and click
598	pos	Can’t elaborate on the functions but I can promise if they DIDNT work I would know
598	pos	He can be picky
598	pos	Not a single complaint about this mouse
599	pos	Extremely smooth on just about any surface
599	pos	I like how easy it is to adjust the weights
599	pos	The weigh cover is on the bottom and is magnetic
599	pos	Playing Cod with this mouse enhanced my play style my average kills went from 21 kills per game to an easy 30+
599	pos	The dpi shift button is pretty cool and kinda useful
599	pos	The mouse wheel has a left click and right click function  and has the ability to be free flowing or not
599	pos	I'll post videos after my wife births our child wish me luck lol
600	pos	I originally purchased the Logitech MS Master 2S wireless mouse but ended up returning that one due to connectivity issues
600	pos	This replacement works so much better
600	pos	Even though I'm not a gamer, I like how the mouse feels (very ergonomic with a nice weight to it), and am looking forward to exploring the different programmable functions in the G Hub software
600	pos	Really happy with the design, feel, customization, and responsiveness of this product
601	pos	Had been on the fence about getting a new mouse and I have to say I'm loving this one, I put the maximum amount of weight it lets and I'm enjoying the scroll wheel ( you and have it unlocked so it will fast scroll)
602	neg	my g502 hero didn't start double clicking until roughly half a year of using it
602	neg	Most clicks are double clicks now
602	neg	other than that, this mouse has a very unique scroll wheel design
602	neg	The ability to switch between a infinite scroll wheel and other regular type seems like a rare/one-of-a-kind design
602	neg	iv used a few dozen different mouses, and for some reason no other mouse can have this design
602	neg	g502 scroll wheel might dunk on every other mouse scroll wheel in the world
602	neg	but the mouse cant go a year without double clicking regularly
602	neg	the absolute top tier scroll wheel with a bottom tier right/ left trigger
602	neg	Other that, this is generally a heavy mouse with alot of other average characteristics
602	neg	I never installed any software to get it to work
603	pos	The mouse works great
603	pos	the easy to click dpi mode buttons are nice
603	pos	It would make more sense to only have 1 button for that and an extra M button, but it's still a great product
603	pos	I initially went with another (Substantial gaming company) brand, and it was a complete failure due to it's lack of drivers and working software
603	pos	I don't know what I was thinking, not going with logitech for any IO device
603	pos	PS:  I have tiny hands and can still reach all the buttons comfortably
604	neg	Mouse was great but started to not register clicks and even "release" the click although I was still holding it down
604	neg	Went through customer support and got a replacement pretty quickly with minimal effort (that's why I gave it a extra star) but the replacement developed the same issue after about a week
605	neg	Great mouse quality, incredible accurate, if heavy mouses arent for you dont even think about this
605	neg	The mouse alone is heavy
605	neg	I tried full weigth (with all the little 3
605	neg	6grams weigths)  and my hand got tired after 2h gaming
605	neg	Removed the weigths and its perfect
605	neg	(EDIT) THE WHEEL STARTED FAILING AFTER 2 MONTHS
605	neg	WHEN U SCROLL IT SOMETIME RANDOMLY STARTS ACTIVATING THE OTHER 2 HOTCKEYS
605	neg	UPDATE: 6 months after normal use (around 2-3h per day)  the ghost clicking hell started
605	neg	Just avoid this mouse and get something else not from logitech
606	pos	Great build quality, feels so natural when your holding it
606	pos	I have bigger hands and it's a dream
606	pos	I do have a two issues with it though
606	pos	👎 "Sniper" button doesn't work whatsoever
606	pos	Maybe every once in awhile when I first owned it (a few months now)👎The mouse wheel clicks left and right, adding 2 more buttons to it
606	pos	In the heat of the moment when your not exactly paying attention and just going hard, you WILL click left or right and do something you were not expecting
606	pos	It's cost me plenty of gamesGood mouse, good everything
606	pos	Just not for me
607	neg	Broke right away, you can't even use the right mouse button
607	neg	The selector input lever to detect your mice button clicks will either read no clicking or multiple clicks
607	neg	It makes precision almost impossible because of constant re-attempting to make sure the click was registered
607	neg	The frustration of this mouse cannot be expressed through written word and I encourage anyone who actually uses a mouse to stay clear from this
607	neg	I purchased this based on amazon ratings which must be advertisements because once I started having this issue and doing some legit research I soon found out there are many other people suffering from this defective piece of junk
607	neg	At this point I'm suspect of all logitec products
608	neg	Had to turn this mouse
608	neg	Excited when I received it but after trying for near 3 hours to program the mouse buttons for regular use, in had to give up
608	neg	Might do well for games but I just wanted it for regular use and everyday use buttons
608	neg	Looks really nice though
608	neg	RETURNED the same day
609	pos	So far the functionality and feel of this mouse are amazing
609	pos	I love everything about it
609	pos	My only problem is that the primary lighting function came in defective and does not turn on
609	pos	I tried going through Logitech G Hub to turn it on but its at 100% brightness and still does not turn on
609	pos	Only the Logo lighting works
609	pos	Not a problem with functionality, just aesthetics
610	pos	Soo I bought this for black Friday and I gotta say I'm disappointed
610	pos	It took over a week to arrive (with prime) and when I got it it worked fine, however on like the 3rd er 4th day using it it would move up or down infinitely without me touching it or just stop sensing the movement
610	pos	The buttons still worked but when I'd move the mouse it wouldnt do anything
610	pos	And so I unplugged it and plugged it in a different USB port which temporarily fixed it but it still keeps doing it
610	pos	It just stops mid game or which is very frustrating especially in fast paced games where seconds count
610	pos	Idk what to do about but I gotta say it's annoying as hell and I know it isn't the system because I plugged in a different mouse and it worked fine for 2 days and then I plugged the g502 in it just didnt register any movement
611	pos	Excellent mouse, as advertised with no hardware issues
611	pos	However, Logitech's G Hub software is a dumpster fire of an application
611	pos	Logitech pushes updates that break the app itself or hardware functionality (like not registering left clicks)
611	pos	Background cpu usage is upwards of 15% on a Ryzen 3600 system
611	pos	G Hub feels like an alpha release and Logitech hasn't be able to improve stability or app performance since they released G Hub back in February 2019
611	pos	Yes, thats 7 months of garbage software support for their flagship hardware products
611	pos	Save yourself the pain and DO NOT DOWNLOAD G HUB
611	pos	The fix is to use the legacy 'Logitech Gaming Software' which is still available and does include support for the 502 Hero
611	pos	I'm using the LGS 9
611	pos	02
611	pos	65 release hosted on TechSpot and have no issues
611	pos	LGS supports button rebinding as well as LED color control in a reliable fashion, unlike G Hub
611	pos	This would be an easy 5 star review but in 2019 I should not be forced to use legacy software to ensure my hardware functions properly
612	pos	I use it on my recliner, works great
612	pos	Only thing is, as a gamer you want your computer empty
612	pos	Why do you have to download software
612	pos	Haven't they figured it out yet
612	pos	Anyhow , I ended up deleting the software and let the thing change colors
612	pos	I have plenty of space, and want to keep it that way
612	pos	Just more stuff running in the background
612	pos	But I still love this mouse
613	neg	Pretty upset that the product isnt lasting as long as the manufacturer claims
613	neg	I hardly play a lot of games and dont play any FPS or games that require a lot of clicking and the Left click is now useless
613	neg	I cant click and hold anything without it unselecting randomly
614	neg	I've had the mouse for a month or two now, and I am now repeatedly getting a problem where the primary mouse button won't drag click properly
614	neg	Do some googling, and it's become a common problem
614	neg	TL:DR - this mouse will break on you, it'll happen right about 3 months in which is when I had discarded the packaging
614	neg	Save the $50
615	pos	Amazing upgrade from G402 model best mouse at a fair price
615	pos	Easily trumps any mouse on the market in my opinion
615	pos	DPI is awesomeParacorded anti tangle wire(not the old school rubber/plastic)Additional buttons from g402 (11 total)more comfortable in handbetter feel overall I have very big hand perfect fit11 customizable buttons/actions (via GHUB) software from manufacturer website, customized rbg lighting
615	pos	No Cons all Pros
616	pos	First off, aside from the scroll wheel issue that I am encountering (and others are encountering), this is the best gaming mouse I've ever owned
616	pos	Very ergonomic and the modular weight system is awesome
616	pos	The problem I'm having is the loose scroll wheel
616	pos	When flicking the mouse left and right you can feel the scroll wheel hitting the sides of the mouse and it is very distracting both from a feel standpoint and the audible clicking noise it makes
616	pos	It is absolutely terrible in freewheel mode where it spins forever but even in the locked mode you can still feel it and it is still audible
616	pos	Not sure how logitec can overlook this
616	pos	As I said great mouse beside this but this is a dealbreaker
616	pos	I will have to return this product
617	pos	I ordered another mouse and could not find the interface to customize it
617	pos	Soooo  I ordered this one and will be returning the other one
617	pos	Took me just a few minutes to figure out the interface and off and going with the computer stuff that I do
617	pos	This is MORE then a gaming mouse
618	pos	I should've bought this mouse a long time ago
618	pos	This mouse is great
618	pos	Plenty of customization and hardware profiles can be loaded if you want to avoid software for things like RGB
618	pos	Build quality is great, design is a little edgy but still doesn't scream 'gamer'
618	pos	Infinity Wheel is surprisingly handy, I notice myself using it more and more
618	pos	If you want a high performance mouse that won't break the bank while looking good, this is the mouse for you
619	neg	Highly tempting to add to your Logitech arsenal
619	neg	Although this is a gaming mouse with good looks and features with RGB and weight adjustments, it may not last
619	neg	This is the second 502 i owned and did not learn from my mistakes
619	neg	The first one had left double click problems, and this one registers left mouse down correctly however left mouse up is involuntary
619	neg	I bought this only 5 months ago
619	neg	I have contacted Logitech support, waiting for their response
619	neg	Edit: Bumping up to 2 stars
619	neg	After back and forth with Logitech support for a couple of weeks, they agreed to send me a replacement
619	neg	Note: No matter how hard you try to convince Logitech support, they will need a video evidence with your mouse in action on the screen
620	neg	Was using a trash $20 gaming mouse, decided to upgrade to this due to the good reviews but I actually hate it
620	neg	Where your thumb rests there is some huge plastic piece that comes out of the side that digs into it and is unbearable (noted I'm 5'8 and don't have huge hands or anything), there are zero ways to use the mouse comfortably
620	neg	The scroll wheel is far too fast and even with all the weights in it still seems light and cheap
620	neg	Used it for about 2 minutes then put it back in the box to collect dust in the closet, thanks logitech :)
621	pos	The mouse itself works well and it is a good choice for everyday use and gaming
621	pos	I love its shape and its breathing LED design, which makes it feel like a sense of technology
621	pos	It is enjoyable to click the mouse
621	pos	But I do find this mouse not fit me that much
621	pos	The resistance of the wheel is too large for me
621	pos	It has some sort of tearing sound apart from the rolling sound when I use the wheel
621	pos	Too many buttons are designed near the thumb and I did accidentally push these buttons when playing the game
621	pos	The worst design in my mind is its antislip surface on two sides
621	pos	The concavity is too obvious and my two fingers which touch two sides feel uncomfortable for a long time use
621	pos	Also it easily cumulates some dirt
622	pos	I find this mouse to be lightweight, but not too lightweight that it feels like it could just slide excessively or more than needed
622	pos	The adjustable scroll wheel option is such an amazing feature
622	pos	I most definitely wish they had more color choices like pink
622	pos	😆
623	pos	I have been using a logitech G500 mouse for years and thought maybe its time for a replacement
623	pos	Since I loved the G500 so much naturally I thought I'd get another logitech mouse
623	pos	I thought the ergonomics would be the same and the weight system would be similar
623	pos	Well I was mistaken you can't get exact same weight as you could with the G500 and the weights aren't interchangeable so Im stuck at a lighter weight then I normally like, not the biggest issue
623	pos	The biggest issue for me is it feels noticeably smaller in my hand making more uncomfortable to use
623	pos	Logitech if you read this bring back the G500, like the one pictured
623	pos	with the newer tech, please
624	neg	So I got the mouse today and the first thing i noticed is the box on the right side was kinda dented in a little
624	neg	and the top left where you open the mouse was a little tattered
624	neg	I didn't have time to open it till around 3 hours later and to my shocking surprise when i was putting the weights the pads seemed like they were used as well as there was dirt stuck on the corners of the pads
624	neg	as well as there was a little almost melted type plastic on the bottom of the mouse
624	neg	I have asked for a refund as well as provided the pictures here for everyone to see
624	neg	This is just unacceptable
624	neg	I will change the rating after i receive what i hope is a brand new mouse
625	pos	Fantastic mouse
625	pos	As a PC gamer with 16 yrs on steam, and many more before that, this mouse is great for me
625	pos	Having the option to lock and unlock the scroll button from free spinning to notched is a great touch
625	pos	My only slight, baby, minor complaint is no pinky rest
625	pos	Don't care though, great mouse
625	pos	Software is unobtrusive and minimalistic but encompassing
625	pos	Love it
625	pos	New favorite
626	neg	It works fine when the scroll wheel isn't broken
626	neg	The first one lasted less than a month
626	neg	I ordered another one and the scroll wheel literally broke in the first hour of use
626	neg	Avoid
627	neg	Just Google "G502 double click" to see how common this problem is
627	neg	After 1-2 years, your left-click (and sometimes right click) will start double clicking automatically some of the time (because the switches are of poor quality)
627	neg	That will make the mouse really annoying to use, as it basically behaves unpredictably when you're clicking/dragging
627	neg	The fixes you'll find on Reddit only work temporarily (like for a few hours at a time)
627	neg	The low price is not so great if you end up buying a new one every year
628	pos	Solid construction, simple easy to use software
628	pos	Solid metal scroll wheel is nice and the endless free scroll feature takes a little getting used to but is very nice once you do
628	pos	I like that there is no rubber "tire" on the scroll wheel to deteriorate or come loose
629	pos	The mouse itself is good, lots of extra buttons, responsive, and weighted but all that is the good
629	pos	now for the bad, the G-Hub doesn't work
629	pos	I have 18 games that are suppose to be "Automatically added" or Scanned that didn't work, so now I have to set up my own profiles that is tedious
629	pos	Its almost like they spent all their money on the mouse and video telling how cool it ism but the software sucks and hinders like 85% of usability
629	pos	FIX YOUR ISSUES LOGITECH
630	pos	I like this mouse so far, the ergonomics work well for a "gaming" mouse
630	pos	My only minor complaints are 2 things: I don't like having to download software to adjust or disable the stupid rgb and set button bindings
630	pos	I also would like some feedback on the scroll wheel (not sure if mine is defective, but it seems designed this way) it spins freely, if you want to hold a position or only scroll 1 or 2 lines its somewhat annoying
630	pos	You can spin the wheel and it keeps going for a few seconds on its own momentum
631	pos	This mouse works great
631	pos	The only issue I have is that the software for configuring the mouse prevents my laptop from going to sleep
631	pos	Not sure if this is an ASUS specific issue or more wide spread
631	pos	Just make sure to close the software from the system tray
632	pos	I have relatively small hands, and this mouse is a perfect fit for me
632	pos	No wrist pain at all
632	pos	The multiple buttons are really nice to have especially for gaming
632	pos	In terms of functionality, I haven’t had any problems with it
632	pos	It does what I need it to do without fail
632	pos	Only “complaint” which isn’t really a complaint because it doesn’t bother me that much, would be the metal scroll wheel getting cold or having some mild slip while using it
632	pos	Other than that this mouse is perfect for me
633	pos	mouse was excellent until the left click failed(click and drag won't work/random double clicks), I also really liked the added weights as i got big goofy hands
633	pos	The quality of the mouse was so good, that even though it;s now broken, I'd still give it 3 stars
633	pos	I've had mice at 1/10th the cost last a decade but this didnt last 3 years
633	pos	Used for light gaming (no e-sports titles or competitive shooters) and studio work
633	pos	Also a slap in the face that a mouse this expensive with clear durability issues not having a longer warranty
634	neg	I've had 4 of these
634	neg	They all end up double clicking when you only try to click once
634	neg	Really annoying in every game
634	neg	You think, "oh that shouldn't matter in rpg games"
634	neg	It does you end up trying to pick up items in your inventory and just put them right back
634	neg	Over and over
634	neg	Oh and forget clicking dialogue
634	neg	It gets in the way of work too
634	neg	Believe me
634	neg	Stay away from this mouse
635	neg	I've owned this mouse for 1 year and 1 month
635	neg	I bought this back on January 30, 2019 and now it double clicks
635	neg	This is the 2nd "gaming" Logitech mouse I've bought that has this problem
635	neg	Very disappointed as this mouse felt great, and I loved the scroll wheel
635	neg	I would understand if it double clicked due to extensive use due to playing high value clicking games such as, Starcraft or Dota
635	neg	But all I play is strategy games which require minimal clicking such as Warhammer total war, or HOI4
636	neg	Right mouse button began double clicking on its own after 2 months of use
636	neg	I play FPS games
636	neg	I'd hold the button to aim and the button would act as if I let go of it then back to aiming
636	neg	I emailed Logitech support and they had me go through 5 different steps to troubleshoot
636	neg	After going through everything it still didn't fix the issue
636	neg	They then asked me for some info including a video of me using an online program to prove the mouse was double clicking
636	neg	After doing everything they asked for I haven't heard from them since
636	neg	It's a great mouse and very comfortable but maybe I got unlucky with this one
636	neg	Not happy with customer service not answering my emails anymore either
636	neg	Waste of $50
637	pos	I had an OG 502 for ages and only realized that it was far too big for my hands when I switched to a G703
637	pos	Which actually says a lot about the quality of a mouse even when it doesn't fit me quite right
637	pos	The 703 had the double click issue and fell apart within a year so I switched to the new model of the 502, it's still a sturdy great mouse and it's served me well
637	pos	However, if you use a fingertip grip or have smaller hands like I do then you're going to want something else, unless you have huge hands
638	neg	The USER Interface is difficult to use
638	neg	The WORST MOUSE Logitech has made in 10 years
638	neg	I have had over 8-9 mice from LOGITECH, this is a turd
638	neg	The mouse is TOO NARROW
638	neg	I just lost a Game online because This meece DOES NOT use The Microsoft SETTINGS
639	neg	I was disappointed with this mouse
639	neg	The scroll wheel has two modes, free spin which is basically unusable for anything and the locked state which is too slow and makes a loud noise
639	neg	The mouse click also requires very little pressure so I accidentally click with it
639	neg	I’m going back to my cheaper Logitech mouse which doesn’t make a loud scrolling sound and is smoother
640	pos	I previously had a G500s for over 5 years which was awesome and worked super well for me over hundreds of hours of shooters, strategy games and productivity tasks
640	pos	I finally decided it was time to upgrade/replace, and this mouse feels amazing
640	pos	The very slidy teflon feet, which allow the G502 HERO to slide much faster than the G500s make the mouse seem faster and more responsive, even at the same DPI
640	pos	The new sensor feels very snappy and precise and allows for very fine movements that the G500s wasn't as accurate at capturing
640	pos	My only complaint is the slightly smaller overall footprint of the mouse
640	pos	As a large-ish handed person I liked how the G500s filled up my whole palm, whereas the G502 falls a little short
640	pos	This is something i am rapidly getting used to though, and I think my in game performance is unaffected by the move to this new mouse, and will probably even improve once I am done adjusting
640	pos	Love Logitech products and am yet to be disappointed
641	neg	This mouse, like many others, uses the cheap Omron switch
641	neg	These switches fail very quickly and very often
641	neg	Unfortunately, my mouse also failed within about 6 months of use
641	neg	This is a shame because everything else about the mouse is great
641	neg	I love using it, but it makes gaming and general productivity take a nose-dive when it struggles with the double-click/click-drag issue
641	neg	I'm currently looking for a replacement
642	pos	I'm going to start by saying almost all my peripherals are logitech, and this is the 5th or 6th logi mouse I've owned, and I have never had one fail so quickly
642	pos	In less than a year the left click button was registering 2-3 clicks when I would click once, and if I tried to hold the button down there's a good chance it will start clicking instead of holding
642	pos	I've already started a claim on it but I would really expect better from logitech
642	pos	I'm really hoping that they get better switches in the future
642	pos	Aside from that, it's great, aside from the failure I can easily say I like the comfort, looks, and ease of programming the buttons and functions on this mouse
643	neg	This mouse was great for a year and nine months
643	neg	Now it jumps around when gaming, won't allow me to properly control characters
643	neg	Instead of instantaneously resizing windows it now takes many seconds as it unwillingly "releases" the window while dragging the edges and suddenly maximizes windows without prompt or warning when dragging the edges
643	neg	I can no longer highlight words using the mouse, a very basic yet important feature
643	neg	The manufacturer offered a firmware upgrade but I noticed little difference
643	neg	I will look at other brands before Logitech in the future when buying a mouse
643	neg	I do not recommend Logitech, if you're looking for a mouse look elsewhere
644	pos	It gets the job done, and at a pretty good price
644	pos	Im not one for rgb, but it has that and it is somewhat customizible
644	pos	It has weights that can be removed
644	pos	I think that the click made by the mouse is a bit anoying, but have dealt with much worse
644	pos	It does occasionally double click or I accidentally click the secondary buttons, but that is probably more due to the fact that I am not used to those secondary buttons even existing
644	pos	If you need a buget mouse for gaming that wont break the bank, I would say that this is a pretty decent choice
645	neg	I really like the ergonomics of this mouse and the features
645	neg	It's got an adjustable to let you set your preference, and you can switch cursor speed quickly on the mouse itself
645	neg	However, there's a major flaw in the design of LMB that makes this mouse incredibly frustrating to use
645	neg	The switch in the LMB will occasionally get in to a state where it registers single clicks as multiple clicks and registers many clicks while holding the button down
645	neg	This only gets worse over time, and there's no workaround for it
645	neg	It seems that this is a common issue with this mouse's design and not a one-off issue that is fixed with a replacement
646	neg	This is the second Logitech mouse I've bought
646	neg	I got the 502 Proteus in January 2018 and this one in July 2019
646	neg	Both have suffered from the same problem where the right mouse click starts double-tapping frequently
646	neg	I had read about this problem in other reviews but figured how bad could my luck be to get two faulty products
646	neg	Turns out my luck is pretty bad
646	neg	When it works it is a great mouse for gaming, but the reliability is not good
646	neg	I wouldn't buy this again
647	pos	I've heard about this mouse and it was on my radar for awhile
647	pos	I have no complaints and actually really like this mouse
647	pos	The shape is nice and the feel is really there
647	pos	I don't use the extra two programmable buttons placed up on the left click but it is still a great mouse
647	pos	DPI changes and the slight RGB makes it very likeable for me; also a weight adjustment if you're into that
648	neg	I bought this item in April
648	neg	I enjoyed it very much
648	neg	I noticed in the last month, however, it is starting to get touchy with the left click
648	neg	more recently I can sometimes not grab items and drag to the next monitor, it lets go randomly
648	neg	The reason I am giving this a 2 is because it seems impossible to contact their support
648	neg	Tried filing a claim on the warranty site but the 'File a Claim' button does not work
648	neg	Sends me to an infinite loop to review product information
648	neg	When I called the number I waited for about 15 minutes, robot on the phone told me to go to their website, and asked if I wanted to leave a voicemail so I did
648	neg	I will update this review as I see fit, but so far; not a good look from Logitech in my eyes
648	neg	Am on the market for a new brand of mouse
649	pos	So ima keep it 100
649	pos	when i got it it was excellent perfect feels good in my big hand nice weight
649	pos	However as of now I cant use it, it has double click issues so I cant drag and drop, I cant hold left click to shoot , the scroll wheel is unresponsive unless I click the middle part and move my mouse down or up to scroll
649	pos	i went on google to look it up and they said its a soldering issue and all of these mice have the potential to do this although I'm unlucky and murphys law was applied just for me
649	pos	I know the buttons are nice but tbh I bought it because of all these reviews for it and it did last a year I just cant give you guys a thumbs up to buy this when its got design flaws
649	pos	I'm gonna look for something else
650	pos	This is a good mouse for gaming
650	pos	Has multiple buttons
650	pos	The on mouse adjustable dpi rate is very cool
650	pos	You can click to switch from slow to fast mouse speed on the mouse
650	pos	The left and right click switches are sensitive enough you can drag click with a little practice
651	neg	DPI settings are infuriating
651	neg	If I have to yell at your mouse, it's trash
651	neg	UI for the settings is absolute garbage
651	neg	Congrats on tricking me into buying trash
651	neg	update: 2 years in and the right button is dead
651	neg	mouse is built like junk so I can't recommend
651	neg	for comparison, i have 10 year old dell mice that came free with some old pc that still work
652	pos	Easy DPI settings adjustment
652	pos	Software required to change colors and change DPI presets, but it's not too crazy
652	pos	I really like the set of weights included, a level of mouse customization I'd never had before
652	pos	No weird double clicks or issues with any of the additional mouse buttons so far, and it's comfortable enough
653	neg	So I have a love hate relationship with this mouse
653	neg	The sensor is great
653	neg	The feel is great
653	neg	The mouse overall is everything I want
653	neg	Now for the bad part
653	neg	I bought the mouse in july and am on my 3rd mouse
653	neg	3 times now because I am not gonna return it again, the main mouse buttons have become glitchy
653	neg	To the point to where if you dont hold it down with the strength of Hercules, it starts deciding it wants to do this thing where it cant decide to be pushed down or not
653	neg	So you get this weird sort of on/off super fast
653	neg	Which being a gaming mouse is horrid
653	neg	Are you trying to ADS, well i hope you like going in and out of zoom at 400 times a minute
653	neg	Want to play a shin-obi that needs to block quickly
653	neg	Eh maybe in half a second when it decides to register the click
653	neg	This is inexcusable
653	neg	Once or twice i can maybe understand
653	neg	But for me to get three mice from logitech that all had the same problem of what I am guessing is the most bottom barrel micro switches for the right and left mouse buttons is ridiculous
653	neg	So this is a great mouse
653	neg	For about 3 weeks before it breaks
653	neg	If you arent a heavy gamer then maybe a week,
654	pos	Something about the shape just feels good
654	pos	Maybe it's the convenient thumb rest but, I love the way this mouse feels in my hand
654	pos	It is wider than most other mice and the side is curved just right, so maybe that's the reason
655	neg	I've been a long time Logitech mouse consumer
655	neg	I was in love with the 3 G500s I owned, each one lasted forever, and died with dignity
655	neg	However, this one really is just awful
655	neg	It has this horrendous double click bug, where anytime you click on something, it thinks its a double click
655	neg	It makes doing about anything impossible
655	neg	I tried to get support for this but was ignored
655	neg	And I guess warranty doesn't matter these days
655	neg	Not sure if I would ever buy a logitech product again at this point if this is how they treat customers
656	pos	My mouse gets a fair amount of usage so I wore the other one out
656	pos	The mouse fits in your hand like it was ment to fit in your hand
656	pos	It has just the right amount of buttons
656	pos	Not too many but just a few extras to be able to macro stuff to
656	pos	Very light mouse so there is weight included depending on how you like the feel of your mouse
656	pos	The DPI button is nice to be able to shift through your profiles depending on what you are doing
656	pos	I would definitely recommend this mouse especially for the price
657	neg	If you've ever joked asking where the "adult" gloves were when you need large size gloves then you will not like this mouse
657	neg	It's slightly too short length and width
657	neg	LEDs didn't work on mine either even after fiddling with the settings but I probably just got a defective one or something
657	neg	Button placements are great and the scroll wheel locked/unlocked feel great though
658	neg	Beware, ordered a new mouse and received one that had clearly already been used
658	neg	There was grime on the bottom, fingerprints on the weights, and the feet of the mouse were clearly scratched from previous use
658	neg	Unsure if it was just because mine was already used, but the mouse wheel also could move left and right, and made a distracting clicking noise
658	neg	Made this noise both when the scroll wheel was locked and unlocked
659	pos	I was having trouble with my Razer mouse (double clicks and non-responsive sometimes) and I saw that reviews of newer models had the same troubles
659	pos	I decided to take the gamble and switch to logitech
659	pos	I have no regrets
659	pos	The mouse is very comfortable in my hand and I love that the scroll wheel can be adjusted to click or scroll continuously
659	pos	It has plenty of programmable buttons and feels like it is made of high quality materials
659	pos	Glad I switched to Logitech
660	pos	It’s a great gaming mouse
660	pos	Pros:Feels great, it’s smooth, and clicks goods
660	pos	Macro is neat and handy
660	pos	Wheel lock can do some funny things in a bunch of games
660	pos	Cons:The current software program that controls everything sucks big ‘ol donkey donger
660	pos	Depending on the game the software craps it’s pants and glitches out the LEDs causing your mouse’s sensor to power down and back up
660	pos	Meaning it stutters your game to hell making you have to turn the LED off
660	pos	The two buttons, left and right wheel, really needs a stronger spring and a more pronounced click
660	pos	It’s not really something you can macro other keys to because they’re unreliable
660	pos	You need a super-flat surface to use the mouse on
660	pos	I’ve used other mice where you can have bumps, hills, and gaps on the field but still be playable but this mouse is not like those
660	pos	Needs to be smooth
661	pos	My teenage son wasn't sure about this mouse when he first got it
661	pos	It just took him a little time to figure it out but now he loves it for gaming
661	pos	We also didn't notice the weights at first that can be added or removed
662	neg	I absolutely love this mouse when it's working
662	neg	Unfortunately, it only lasts about 6 months before the primary mouse button starts to malfunction
662	neg	This is the 3rd time this has happened and seems to be typical poor Logitech quality control
662	neg	There are too many solid alternatives out there to continue down this frustrating path
662	neg	I am moving to a different manufacturer
662	neg	Done with Logitech
663	pos	lots of features and all the DPI you'll never get to use
663	pos	great for gaming
663	pos	not a bunch of buttons you gotta memorize and its rgb setting works perfect for my setup
663	pos	on the fly dpi changing and reducing button
664	neg	If you enjoy losing FPS games and experiencing endless frustration, then this is the mouse for you
664	neg	I would not recommend anyone buy this mouse
664	neg	After about 6 month of use the right mouse button goes to sh*t and experiences a double clicking issue
664	neg	If you do any FPS gaming you know this is a complete deal breaker
664	neg	You will lose any firefight your engage in
664	neg	It’s a shame because the feel of the mouse is great
664	neg	If it weren’t for this issue I’d give this mouse 5 stars, but this issue alone tanks the mouse to to 1 star
664	neg	I’d rather play on a 1990 Lenovo trackpad
664	neg	Save the money and buy something else
664	neg	I will never buy another Logitech mouse product
665	pos	The media could not be loaded
665	pos	I personally love the weights it comes with so you can fine tune the weight for your movements and adjust accordingly
665	pos	Also the ability to fine tune the sensitivity of the mouse is awesome
665	pos	You can make it super quick once you get your movements down and more accurate
666	pos	Though the look didnt originally captivate me its really come to grow on me
666	pos	The feel is excellent
666	pos	Action is smooth ( I used the weights)
666	pos	Plenty of programmable buttons and a light util you can download for free
666	pos	The scroll wheel (when you release the brake) feels like its got a fidget spinner bearing in there, weeeee, that thing spins crazy fast/long
666	pos	Anyway, im very satisfied by this mouse, and its price
666	pos	Never been disappointed with Logitech so im not too surprised
666	pos	GG Logitech, thanks
667	pos	This is my favorite gaming mouse
667	pos	I’m on my fourth one
667	pos	That said, I usually need to replace it at least once a year
667	pos	Every single Logitech mouse that I’ve owned has developed a double click issue after about a year
667	pos	Even my more expensive G903 developed this issue
667	pos	Resolving involves disassembly which requires removal of the mouse feet
667	pos	Even then, the issue will quickly reappear after a few months
668	pos	The mouse only measures 2
668	pos	5 inches wide without the thumb support jutting out the end
668	pos	It's very very thin, two of my fingers were hanging off the end of it
668	pos	The ergonomics of this mouse is tall over wide, so if you want a flat mouse this isn't for you
668	pos	The movement across my mousepad was very very smooth, when I was playing cs with it I noticed a visible difference to my aim because of it
668	pos	Only problem was I couldn't hold the mouse because it was too small
668	pos	The quality of material is exceptional, every part of it is good
668	pos	I just cant use it
668	pos	addendum: My palm is 4 inches wide and my hand is 8 1/4 inch long, so I suppose it would be difficult to have an ergonomic mouse
668	pos	if you don't have large hands buy the mouse
669	pos	Gaming: 10/10
669	pos	With all the weights in it is solid and heavy allowing you to do more accurate and careful pointing with the mouse
669	pos	Take the weights out and you’ve got a surprisingly light mouse that can whip around
669	pos	It is NOT as light as a lot of other mice, so be warned there
669	pos	I haven’t gotten any arm or wrist strain so it’s not a worry for me anyway
669	pos	General use: 10/10
669	pos	I do like the placement of the buttons on the mouse, and setting up macros and functions is easy and quick
669	pos	Overall
669	pos	Maybe $70 is a bit high, but it’s always on sale and I found a “used” one (box had a scratch in it haha) for $30
669	pos	It also looks pretty darn cool
670	pos	I love all the buttons and configurations I can set to them
670	pos	I also that I can switch sensitivity on the fly with the DPI shortcuts
670	pos	I would def recommend
670	pos	People say it's heavy but personally I like some weight to my house to be able to "feel" it
670	pos	10/10 would def buy again
670	pos	in fact i have two
670	pos	one for home and one for work, which is very helpful because I am able to program commonly used commands like copy, paste, etc
671	pos	This mouse is great, don't get me wrong, but there are some things to be weary about, and its not Logitech's fault
671	pos	To start off, the mouse looks and feels great, aside from t he fact that it is a bit small, but I have some big hands
671	pos	The back button is a little bit to far from my thumb to use it quickly, but a little bit of movement isn't gonna kill me
671	pos	The Clicks are nice and crisp, but the buttons DO TEND to press down when I don't want them to
671	pos	The thumb buttons (Back, forward, DPI up/ down, DPI shift) are a little light and get pressed down much easier than my other mouse, Bit I just need to adjust and I'll get used to it
671	pos	The infinite scroll is AMAZING, but the side clicks come with minimal force as well
671	pos	Again, I just need to adjust
671	pos	The mouse over all DID come with all of the things it needed to (Weights, Manual, actual mouse, etc)
671	pos	The weights fit in snug and show no signs of popping loose
671	pos	The bottom "Flap" or whatever you call it, is easy to remove and place back
671	pos	Wire is braided, not the lightest, but still gets the job done well, it is also very long, so you'll have no trouble reaching it to your PC without any restrictions for the most part
671	pos	The software is also very useful and you can reprogram ALL of the buttons to be whatever you want them to be, and the RGB is pretty nice and vivid
671	pos	The sensor is very accurate and well worth the buy
671	pos	Great mouse
672	pos	So far after a month of use, this mouse has been really great
672	pos	Wire isn't as annoying as I thought ir would be (have been using wireless for a decade), and the sensor is the best I've used
672	pos	Logitech software is also easy to use to change the RBG and set profiles for DPI
672	pos	Would highly recommend this mouse
673	pos	this gaming mouse was a good buy for me got it on sale dont really find a problem with the scroll wheel like most people say in the review but i do got to say if you use the  Programmable buttons on the scroll wheel for games its really easy to  Accidentally tap it it gets a little frustrating but once you get the feel for it its nice
673	pos	Had the  Corsair m65 gaming mouse
674	pos	Awesome mouse
674	pos	Everything about it is gets an A+ from my books
674	pos	The only mouse that can probably beat this is a vertical mouse, but there aren't many in the market that can beat this
674	pos	If there is --which I don't know about -- would probably cost extremely expensive, and paying that much for a mouse is kind of ridiculous
675	neg	I had the G302 mouse which lasted 5 years before developing double click issues
675	neg	Huge fan of that mouse
675	neg	This mouse I have for just over a year and it has double clicking, dragging issues
675	neg	If your going to spend $50 on a gaming mouse buy something else unless you want to replace it every year
676	pos	Scroll button loose
676	pos	If playing a game that requires a quick scroll, even if it's adjusted to be click scroll, it's too loose so that it's difficult to switch precisely
676	pos	Maybe with time one could get used to it
676	pos	Not returning as it's a solid mouse, but it's going to the secondary computer
677	pos	Best mouse you will ever buy
677	pos	This is my second one because I wanted one for work as well
677	pos	I have had my older one for over a year and no issues
677	pos	Great feel in your hand, programmable to just plug into any computer and have the programed button keys working as it should
678	neg	It worked great for 1 year
678	neg	Then I started having the clicking issue that multiple other people have mentioned in their reviews
679	neg	All of the dpi buttons for this mouse are in striking range of your left mouse button and mb3
679	neg	So very often you will change your dpi mid game play with a miss click or larger hands
679	neg	Simply resting your hand on your mouse can easily change the dpi of this mouse
679	neg	This is unacceptable and renders the mouse useless especially for any mmo, or fps
680	pos	Initial Review Jan 16, 2021What I like best about this mouse is the main buttons have a nice click, not too loud, not too quiet
680	pos	It is well constructed of good materials
680	pos	The color indicates the mouse speed which is really handy
680	pos	I recommend this mouse for gaming
681	pos	The mouse is great, definitely a huge step up from what I was using before
681	pos	The button that makes the DPI super slow is great for aiming especially in games like Fortnite where I use it the most
681	pos	some of the buttons towards the rear are kind of difficult to reach but I don't use them anyways
681	pos	However, I have had troubles with the software, every time I restart my computer or update it and get on I'll click one of the buttons or move the cursor and realize it's at factory settings
681	pos	So then I go to G hub and It's stuck on a loading screen forever which isn't good when you're in the middle of a match, on top of that it never stops loading so I end up having to delete and reinstall G hub everytime I restart my computer
681	pos	Dont know if It's just my computer or what
681	pos	Overall good mouse, would definetly purchase again
682	neg	In less than a year from purchase my mouse started randomly registering double clicks with the left mouse button
682	neg	After researching the issue it seems this is a known issue with these
682	neg	After contacting Logitech and getting the runaround for over a month they still refuse to replace the mouse under warranty
682	neg	Save yourself the trouble and buy a different brand
683	pos	I've been looking for a mouse that fits my hands "properly" so that my hand doesn't cramp after using it for hours
683	pos	I'm a power user, gamer, programmer, creator and I need something that moves fast, doesn't need to be recharged, is programmable and well pretty colors I can manipulate are also appreciated
683	pos	Seriously though, this mouse glides so nicely, and I absolutely love the scroll lock toggle
684	pos	The options are great - I like being able to customize just about anything on it
684	pos	I frequently hit the button to change the DPI unintentionally, but that is not a big issue as I am not a gamer
684	pos	The overall feel is awesome - just right for my hand, both shape and size
684	pos	Very happy with this mouse
685	pos	Outstanding product
685	pos	I had a free-scrolling mouse for years (also by Logitech), and this is an excellent replacement after going back to a $10 crappy mouse
685	pos	The keys and software are great even for data entry tasks that are repetitive and involve multiple key presses
685	pos	I’ve moved everything to the right hand
686	pos	Only issue I had is I seem to be bumping or somehow changing my dpi accidentally all the time
686	pos	, kind've annoying but you can easily click it back to preferred dpi setting
686	pos	But now I've got DOUBLE CLICKING
686	pos	My left click when you try to click and hold will sometimes double click and not actually hold down
686	pos	Very annoying when bow hunting in this new trendy Valheim game as you waste all your arrows at your feet
686	pos	Currently looking for a better mouse option
687	pos	Love this mouse for gaming
687	pos	I can make several different profiles for different games and change with a click
687	pos	I bind actions to my mouse and these buttons are in a great spot for easy access
687	pos	You can customize it in so many ways
687	pos	This is my second one I got for my other computer since I love my first one so much
688	pos	I have always loved the G series mice, and these are no exception
688	pos	I have one for my work laptop, my home laptop, and my desktop
688	pos	I use them heavily daily and each one has been customized so the extra buttons performs tasks appropriate for the usage I'm going for
688	pos	I like the weight, I like the high DPI, and I love the feel
689	neg	I understand that people will return a mouse if it isn't the right fit for their, however I expect an unused mouse
689	neg	This one seemed like it was used for a month or two due to the wear on the gliders, and fingerprints were all over the extra weights
689	neg	To me, this is unacceptable for something I purchased new
689	neg	Outside of being used, the mouse wheel is the main reason I am returning this
689	neg	The mouse wheel will rattle when the mouse is moved quickly, and is too easy to bump to the right and left, while difficult to press downward
689	neg	The scrolling wasn't smooth either
689	neg	The mouse gliders seem to be a bit thin as well, as it has a bit of a scraping sound on my desk, while my G400s that I've had for a few years is almost silent
689	neg	Not impressed for how expensive the mouse is
690	pos	I've been a long time Logitech fan
690	pos	Keyboards, Mice, Remotes
690	pos	but I've been away from a Logitech mouse for nearly 4 years but I'm back
690	pos	This mouse is just so smooth, glides across my mousepads surface, ample amount of buttons, including the G Suite software
690	pos	It's super easy to program macros of all combinations and map them specifically
690	pos	The RGB logo and the DPI meter are a nice touch to customize
691	neg	Great mouse, has everything I need
691	neg	Unfortunately, the left mouse button began to fail within months of use as if it were a no name piece of junk from Wish
691	neg	Very dissatisfied and I will never buy Logitech again
692	neg	DO NOT BUY
692	neg	Under 2 months of using the mouse everyday, suddenly the G4 button (the "back" button) got SOFTWARE stuck, I took it to a store to fix, they removed the button, removed the board that controls the left side buttons, removed the connection between that board and the main board, and the "back" command was still stuck
692	neg	We tested it using the key S and it never stopped typing it
692	neg	Not when assembled or disassembled
692	neg	Only when we disabled the button function through the HUB it stopped giving the command of typing the letter S
692	neg	Bummer
693	pos	Excelente mouse, ideal para juegos, la sensación mejora considerablemente al deslizar el mouse comparado con otros, solo tuve un detalle, juego Halo y no pude configurar los botones laterales de la rueda del mouse pero esto no es un defecto del mouse, es de configuración de software
693	pos	Lo recomiendo 100 %
694	neg	After about 6mo of mostly desktop use (office, email, text editing) and a few dozen hours of gaming, the left mouse button's switch is broken
694	neg	It registers clicks, but if you try to click and hold it acts like you're clicking like mad instead--some sort of electrical connectivity problem
694	neg	Logitech pushed a firmware update to "update click debouncing algorithm" (technical term for this sort of issue) last month, and it helped--for all of two weeks
694	neg	Now it's worse than before
694	neg	Searching around online reveals this is apparently a widespread issue with Logitech gaming mice
694	neg	Wish I'd known that before I bought
694	neg	Decades of <$20 crap mice and this is the first time I've seen this problem--apparently Logitech is not the brand it once was
694	neg	They've lost me as a customer
695	pos	really good fit for my hands, plenty of buttons and dpi up/down switch
695	pos	Seems super responsive and versatile
695	pos	On board profile switching and automatic game profiles too
695	pos	Has weights you can add/take out to finetune your feel
695	pos	You can get like up to 12 keys if you really mess around with the shortcuts
696	neg	This mouse for gaming isnt really good its only good if u are playing mmo games but still its not the best for the price
696	neg	For shooters its just too heavy and it doesnt feel good at all for flicking and tracking or doing anything for gaming
696	neg	The mouse also feel extremely cheap
697	neg	So I've had this mouse for a couple months
697	neg	I use it most days
697	neg	Shortly after the warrenty period ended the mouse would start disconnecting from G Hub which would cause it to loose all of it's settings until I unplugged it and plugged it back in
697	neg	Then the sensor started doing strange stuff
697	neg	I thought maybe it was dust on the sensor so I cleaned the area and as time has gone on it's only gotten worse
697	neg	Last night I had to unplug it and plug it back in a dozen times or so just to get it to start tracking properly again
697	neg	I've owned Logitech mice before such as the G700s which lasted me literally 6 years (and is about to go back into service)
697	neg	I don't know if I just got a defective product or if Logitech quality has gone down hill in the last several years but at this time I can't recommend this mouse
697	neg	Fun fact, I've had to unplug the mouse about a half dozen times just writing this review
698	neg	In terms of use and ease of programming, I would give this mouse 5 stars
698	neg	The problem is that it only worked well for maybe 6 months
698	neg	It has still not completely failed, but the left mouse button tends to flicker, sometimes making drag moves very difficult (the continual clicking/unclicking drops whatever I am trying to drag)
698	neg	I don't know if this is by design to make people buy new mice regularly, poor manufacturing, or if I am just unlucky
699	neg	The mouse was great until the double click issue happened
699	neg	Now this mouse is trash
699	neg	I had it for 15 months and now it has to get thrown out
699	neg	I would look for something else before buying this one or any other Logitech mouse
700	pos	This is a nice mouse
700	pos	It feels responsive
700	pos	I like the tactile mouse wheel
700	pos	However, this mouse is narrower than logitech's other offerings
700	pos	It causes pain when using and the DPI shift buttons and back/forward buttons are constantly being accidentally triggered during gameplay
700	pos	If you have smaller hands, this may be a good mouse
700	pos	Coming from a G400, this is much smaller than I can tolerate, and I don't have exceptionally large hands
701	pos	Mouse is wonderful responsive and works great
701	pos	However it is easy to press a button accidentally that lowers the dps setting so be on the lookout for that
701	pos	Using software that helps out with that works like a charm
702	neg	Mouse could have been great, but the software is awful
702	neg	Ghub will not recognize my mouse without having to constantly reinstall the program
702	neg	This isn't like once a week or anything, no it's if I turn my computer off I have to reinstall GHUB
702	neg	It's a waste of time
703	neg	I tried to like this mouse, but in the end, I really HATE it
703	neg	For some reason they put the "increase resolution" right next to left-click (no space at all between them)
703	neg	So, I've had to disable the adjustable resolution entirely, just to make the mouse usable
704	pos	Great quality, good app, and great lighting
704	pos	Overall this has become the main mouse for my setup
704	pos	Nothing to really complain about, it's a pretty good product, and its unlikely that something will beat it at its price range
705	pos	Step down from the old G500, less ergo, position and feel of buttons compromised to make it look racy
705	pos	Has pretty LED colors instead of the quality feel of the older models
705	pos	And it uses G-HUB software that pretty much won't work with your older Logitech stuff
706	pos	I love this mouse
706	pos	As for the price, it is outstanding in my opinion
706	pos	The wheel is metal and just feels so great plus the two different modes for the wheel are awesome
706	pos	It has great accuracy and the clicks feel great
706	pos	It is adjustable as far as weight goes
706	pos	I purchased this wired mouse because it fits my situation
706	pos	I am setting up with a couchmaster in a recliner so the wired mouse is no issue
706	pos	The wire will just be internal so it works for me
706	pos	I would definitely buy this again
707	pos	The mouse functions well
707	pos	However, the buttons are loose and feel cheap
707	pos	The software programming is unnecessarily complicated and should work more like the Options utility for the non-gaming mice
707	pos	Also, the settings are unreliable and the device & software combo doesn’t save programming across devices or platforms
707	pos	Lastly the device is NOT Apple Macintosh mobile compatible as the mouse is missing a USB-C adapter
708	neg	The problem I have with this mouse was when I received it the paint on the right clicker had a bubble that peeled off within the 2nd day
708	neg	I wanted to really like this mouse because of all the numerous enchancements but
708	neg	The size of it was really what killed it for me unfortunately and I don't really have that big of a hand
708	neg	I'd say medium to large
709	neg	DPI button stopped working not even 10 hours into use
709	neg	The only good thing about this mouse is the wheel on it
709	neg	The rest of it is trash
709	neg	Save yourself the money and get on of the pictek mouses
710	pos	This mouse has proven it's self time and time again, I recommend it to everyone I know
710	pos	I game a lot, and have had mine for almost 5 years now and it's still kicking  (G502 Proteus Spectrum model, but same base model)
711	pos	This mouse is heavy
711	pos	I regularly play fps games so a light mouse is ideal but I went with it because I watched a lot of reviews and heard a lot of great things about it
711	pos	I have used it for about three months now and I have had no issues with it
711	pos	I plan on lightening this mouse some way in the near future but until then I do fine with it
711	pos	It did take some time to adjust considering I came from a mouse that was about 20g lighter
711	pos	I do recommend buying a bungee for your mouse
711	pos	For this mouse I bought a razor bungee because it has a braided cable and it works perfectly with it
711	pos	In terms of size I have hands larger than most people so I find having a claw grip works best for me and this mouse is fine for that
711	pos	It forms to the hand well and feels great, if you have never tried a g502 before I recommend trying it
711	pos	Also to note I took off the bottom of the mouse where you are suppose to put the weights that come with it and it lightened it a bit and have had no problems playing with it off
712	pos	I love this mouse so much I own 3 of em
712	pos	one for each PC I own
712	pos	The mouse click in it can get messed up after prolonged use, but it doesnt happen in every mouse, and is an easy fix after watching a few youtube videos
712	pos	The weight of the mouse is perfect, the buttons are in the perfect places, and it just feels good in your hand
712	pos	Very high dpi and accuracy of movement making it perfect for pro gamers as well
712	pos	Highly recommend this mouse
713	pos	I like the logtech mice
713	pos	This one has just enough buttons, although we all could probably design our own a tad bit different
713	pos	This works really well in Ghub sub software, make sure to install that to run this mouse to full potential
714	neg	There is a known problem with the LMB (left mouse button) for several users (check google)
714	neg	If you hold it down the LMB  registers as if you are tapping it rapidly
714	neg	This is extremely frustrating when you are dragging and dropping as it registers the LMB down up down up down up etc
714	neg	I emailed customer service with a detailed email
714	neg	After several emails (over the course of a month) they proceeded to tell me to go to a different site to test my mouse, make a video with my phone with the mouse and screen in the picture (really
714	neg	), upload it to youtube and then send them a link
714	neg	ARE YOU KIDDING ME
714	neg	If that's the end result then why did you waste a month of back and forth emails, Logitech
714	neg	I should have stuck with Roccat
715	pos	This mouse has great quality material and works amazing
715	pos	Even the small weights that you can add at the bottom are amazing
715	pos	I’ve used this mouse for both mmo gaming and first person shooter gaming and highly recommend for anyone looking for a not super expensive, super high quality gaming mouse
716	pos	I'm quite happy with this mouse for use in gaming and with my work
716	pos	The options available to customize it for individual needs are very helpful
716	pos	From adjusting the weight to configuring the functionality of each button to the dpi options
716	pos	it's all good in my book
717	pos	I never stop to appreciate the quality of packaging
717	pos	This time, I did
717	pos	It's very nicely packaged
717	pos	I love the little weights you can add to the mouse, and the scroll wheel has two modes, a fast, smooth one and a slower, more precise one where you get some haptic feedback with each scroll, very useful for gaming
717	pos	The accent lights are changeable, very nice feel overall
718	neg	TL;DR: Mouse breaks quickly
718	neg	I'm a casual gamer, but I use my mouse pretty frequently
718	neg	The button locations and customizability were nice
718	neg	I bought mine about 9 months ago
718	neg	It worked great for the first ~5 months
718	neg	Then the left mouse button (LMB) started double-clicking when I single clicked
718	neg	This made it frustrating, but almost usable
718	neg	After a month, this went away for a couple weeks before it came back worse
718	neg	It's now unusuable because I cannot click-drag or single click reliably
718	neg	I tried contacting Logitech, and they sent back a long email of many steps to try to fix the problem
718	neg	None of those steps resolved the issue
719	pos	Well, it fits good, but not as good as my 505s which they don't make anymore
719	pos	L/R buttons are too soft, too easy to right click by mistake
719	pos	Wheel is not as grippy as it should be
719	pos	Also, when you move the scroll wheel, the detents are too aggressive and you "miss" as in your finger slips off
719	pos	Has to be a way to lessen the stiffness of the scroll wheel
719	pos	We'll see as time goes on
719	pos	Won't buy it again tho nor will I recommend it
720	neg	I had high hopes for this mouse
720	neg	I like the fact that it was corded, as my cordless (Logitech) mouse was not responding anymore
720	neg	From the moment I got it, the software setup was ridiculous
720	neg	A big black square that you have to close of just to even get a hint at the menu, which has settings selection minimized
720	neg	All I wanted to do was to get the lighted logo on the mouse to stop breathing and changing color
720	neg	I would have preferred it not to even be present
720	neg	You can set this, but it's bindings break while you use the mouse and cause your gameplay to be very unstable and sometimes it will force a complete pc restart
720	neg	AVOID this gimmick
720	neg	It would be a FINE mouse if Logitech didn't farm the software portion out to be developed by kids in a sweatshop
720	neg	I loved Logitech, but this will be the LAST product I buy from them
721	neg	When the mouse works, I like the mouse
721	neg	Plenty of buttons to operator and responsive enough for me and feels pretty nice
721	neg	However, my mouse started having the double click issue which is issue that caused me to swap from Razer to Logitech
721	neg	I was able to get a replacement from Logitech at a reasonable time, I know they are busy in these times, but when it arrived the G8 key (default DPI Shift Up) was loose and slightly out of position, I have to shift the button around and press extremely hard to get it to work, not reasonable for in the middle of a game (I tend to map certain inputs to that button)
721	neg	I have yet to see if I can fix it myself, but both mice having a hardware issue is rather disappointing
721	neg	Would not recommend at this time myself
722	neg	I had all sorts of issues with this right out of the box
722	neg	Simple actions like left and right clicking wouldn't work on other windows unless you clicked a "profile change" or "g-shift" button
722	neg	None of Logitech's software was helpful either
722	neg	Complete waste of a mouse and waste of my time
723	pos	4 out of 5 for one reason: though this mouse is big, bug hands like mine are not its target audience, and I hate so much that its not the most comfortable mouse for me because I love every single other thing about this mouse
723	pos	The back of it drops off too fast, and its too shallow for large hands (8 inches from the base to the tip of the middle finger)
723	pos	So typically it becomes a bit of a struggle to get it in a good position, but thankfully it is still good for a palm grip because its very long, youll just be dragging your palm on the mousepad a lot and your pinky and ring fingers will have a hard time figuring out where to go
723	pos	Otherwise, everything else about this mouse is perfect and definitely lives up to the marketing material
724	pos	At the time of writing this review, I've destroyed this mouse through fault of my own
724	pos	Liked it so much I bought a second one (the wireless version of the same model
724	pos	)It doesn't make you a God of aim, but you sure as hell feel like one, and it absolutely makes you capable
724	pos	Good work Logitech, you've made the best gaming mouse ever
725	pos	Unbeatable value at $34
725	pos	95
725	pos	Full of features and great build quality
725	pos	Excellent for everyday use and does well for gaming
725	pos	Fair usability as a large hand fingertip gripper, better with claw, ideal with medium hand palm
726	pos	I got this product when it was on sale for 35 bucks and it's original price is 90$ or more so it was a good deal and honestly love how all the side buttons and middle wheel buttons are programmable for every game so saves a lot of button pressing on keyboard
726	pos	Perfect for fortnite users who need to build fast
727	pos	Out of the dozens of mice I have owned this is by far my favorite
727	pos	The dimensions make this mouse great for large and wide hands, while still being dynamic enough to comfortably detach from the palm for finer movements
727	pos	The thumb shield on the side is generous, and seems like it can support even the largest of thumbs
727	pos	The unlockable scroll wheel is super fun
727	pos	The buttons all have a decent amount of resistance to them and are well positioned to avoid accidental clicks
727	pos	Overall this mouse offers a lot through a good balance of fun and functionality
728	neg	I have a G700S best mouse i have ever owned, getting old, so i looked for a new mouse, i decided on the G502 hero
728	neg	didnt use it for a long time so when my G700 finally got to the point of not working i used the 502 man what a mistake, when you go to shoot nothing happens you have to keep clicking the firte button to get it to work, biggest mistake i ever made, after hours upon hours of trying to find some reason behind it i finally gave up, i broke out the G700 and patched it the best i can dont know what to do now i have a paper weight 502 that is useless to me and since i dint use it right away and waited so long to use it i cant return it
728	neg	sucks
729	pos	This is probably one of the best mice I have ever owned
729	pos	It's got a fair amount of buttons, feels great in the hand and sails smoothly over the mousepad
729	pos	It's seriously great
729	pos	It's also nice that it comes with adjustable weights and rgb and all that
730	pos	I have owned all of the version of the g502, it by far is the best mouse you can buy
730	pos	The level of customization is just endless
730	pos	The Hero is definitely an upgrade from the previous one
730	pos	The buttons feels so much better, much more clicky, and the finish of the mouse feels a lot better too, I can get a much better grip of it than I could with the Proteus Spectrum
730	pos	Even the scroll wheel feel better
730	pos	This mouse gives the most bang for your bucks
730	pos	Trust me, you won't regret buying it
731	pos	Great mouse, i love the fluid controls and how everything is right where i need it
731	pos	i game on a laptop, and between this mouse and my gameing pad, I dont even need a full keyboard
731	pos	The software provides excellent customization capabilities
731	pos	I really like that i can customize all led zones
731	pos	the one negative, FOR ME, is it's kinda small
731	pos	i have a pretty large hand so something a little wider would probably suit my dexterity purposes better
731	pos	that being said, being able to add weight makes it a little easier to control
731	pos	over all a great product that truly performs
731	pos	the DPI shift button is an amazing feature
731	pos	snappy head shots are almost a given at ANY time haha
731	pos	great product
732	pos	honestly the best mouse i've ever owned
732	pos	because i game so much i usually go through Mice pretty hard
732	pos	this one has stood up to my constant use, and pretty much laughs at me every time
732	pos	the weights are nice to have, and the software was really easy to install and get set up for the color changing
732	pos	goes amazingly well with alienware :D
733	pos	I use this mouse for mainly for gaming, but this mouse is perfect for everyday use, I love this mouse cause of how versatile it is
733	pos	I love playing with snipers with this mouse becuase fo the ease of shifting dpi so quickly, This mouse is SOOOO accurate, turn the games mouse sensivity WAY DOWN and turn your mouse sensitivity ALLL THE WAY UP to 25,600 dots per inch YOU WILL LOVE IT, you can assign each button to suit your play style, you can have saved setups for different game which is AWESOME to me, I would fully recomend this mouse to anyone
734	pos	My arms are like coiled steel
734	pos	Lifting this mouse every day to game is like a full body workout
734	pos	Mortals will weep at how dexterous and strong your arms are
735	neg	Avoid
735	neg	Junk
735	neg	Bad part quality
735	neg	Microswitches are garbage
735	neg	No clicks, double clicks
735	neg	Cannot drag anything
735	neg	Waste of money
735	neg	Logitech used to have a great reputation for quality
735	neg	They ruined it with their cheap part selection
736	pos	Amazing mouse
736	pos	Not sponsored BTW
736	pos	This mouse feels decent in your hand
736	pos	There are nicely placed side buttons
736	pos	You can toggle the scroll wheel to spin freely with the use of a toggleable button
736	pos	My complaint is that it doesn't have much rgb lights which my other mouse had before I broke it
736	pos	Kinda wish the mouse was more bright and colorful than it is
736	pos	Maybe a nice rgh light strip on the base outline of the mouse that you can customize with an app would be nice
736	pos	I would pay like at least 10 more dollars for that
736	pos	Take notes Logitech
737	pos	I have used the mouse over 2 years
737	pos	With a large, Alpha-male's hand, I dislike the thin layout
737	pos	My hand cramps trying to hold it for long periods-of-time
737	pos	Most recently, the right click has began to fail
737	pos	While holding it down, the right-click will stop functioning and I have to release and right-click again to initiate it
738	neg	I have finally had it with Logitech's quality issues
738	neg	I have forgiven for past finish issues but now my only 9 month old mouse with light to moderate gaming is double clicking or getting stuck sporadically
738	neg	I have finally tired of their quality control issues, this is my last Logitech product
739	pos	This is an updated version of a very popular mouse
739	pos	Excellent feel in my hand
739	pos	Buttons are responsive and have a quiet but audible click
739	pos	The whole mouse feels well built and the cable is flexible and durable
739	pos	The associated Logitech program is very useful with automatic profiles although I prefer to program the onboard mouse settings and set up keybinds in game
740	pos	Very ergonomic
740	pos	I am a stroke survivor, and have limited use of my right hand
740	pos	This mouse's DPI levels easily make it a breeze to use, and it fits so well in my hand
740	pos	Buttons are easy to reach, but far enough apart that you don't accidentally misclick something
740	pos	Download the Logitech software to easily assign whatever you want to the buttons
741	pos	The mouse works well
741	pos	It is comfortable, adjustable, has weights to make it easier to use
741	pos	The only thing I hate is that the GHUB software is very confusing
741	pos	It still doesn't seem to have all the functionality of the old software
741	pos	Eventually I got it to do what I needed, to save profiles on the mouse itself
741	pos	I am using it with a USB switch to control multiple computers
741	pos	This also allows me to use on Linux computers
742	neg	I ordered this new g502 hero since I used the proteus spectrum and I decided to upgrade
742	neg	When I received it I noticed it was not flat and there was a glider that was stacked making it uneven
742	neg	So I got a replacement and this one one of the gliders was not even attachedluckily it wasn't stuck on yet so I was able to place it where it was supposed to be
743	pos	Honestly, this is a great mouse
743	pos	I love the fact you can on the fly adjust your scrolling speed with a press of a button and let that middle wheel fly
743	pos	The only thing that's pointless is the front of the mouse , you can't see it ever, so don't let that weird spiky front scare you away its all good, buy this now
743	pos	FYI I can from a G9 laser mouse that I owned for almost 10 years, this feels just right
744	neg	The default DPI buttons are positioned so closely to the left mouse button that the only real option for them is to disable the buttons completely
744	neg	This mouse is not suitable for any serious gamer
744	neg	On the plus side, it is a well built unit and perfectly suitable for everyday use
745	neg	Since around 4 months after I got the mouse left button stop working proper in game and out
745	neg	It can't even move windows without having issues
745	neg	In game to shot I had to remap, it was just horrible
745	neg	Bought in august of 19 and now its its March of 2021, I think it only worked properly the first month to four before going to crap
746	pos	So to start off I bought this mouse because it’s the mouse everyone talks about when it comes to gaming
746	pos	While I like this mouse I think the the Corsair m65 is a far more comfortable and efficient gaming mouse
746	pos	The DPI selection buttons On the G502 are in an awkward and easily mistaken press able location which effects gameplay
746	pos	So in my opinion while this is a good mouse for the same price I would buy the Corsair m65
747	pos	Honestly the biggest upgrade is not having to use razers software, its garbage
747	pos	logitech's software isn't the best, but way better than Razers
747	pos	Weight wise i didnt feel much of a difference and the amount of buttons is very nice
747	pos	I also use the free scroll wheel pretty often when browsing the web
748	neg	I got this mouse roughly 9 months ago
748	neg	The shape of the mouse is good, the braded cable is very nice and the weight system is very good
748	neg	However the switches in this mouse are abysmal, after just 9 months they have started to die, I get constant double clicks and the mouse frequently stops holding down clicks, making the mouse practically unusable as dragging windows, highlighting text, and playing games where you have to hold buttons a massive pain or completely impractical
748	neg	If these are the standards Logitech holds their products to I would avoid this mouse at all costs as you can likely get something much more reliable for this price
749	neg	I'm on my 3rd one in 2 years
749	neg	The left mouse button keeps messing up
749	neg	It either won't register a click, clicks twice, or releases when you're still holding down on the button
749	neg	Feels great in the hand, but that left mouse button is just reliably unreliable on all 3 of the ones I've had now
749	neg	Avoid
750	pos	This mouse has the index finger buttons I was looking for, has a good material feel, and on-the-fly DPI switching
750	pos	So far it's working flawlessly, and I'm liking it as a replacement for my Corsair Saber
751	neg	Same issue that a lot of other people are having
751	neg	Right at 6 months; I have double clicking issues that are getting worse every day (impossible to use)
751	neg	Been buying this brand my whole life
751	neg	Not going to anymore
751	neg	So many people having the same issues and almost all of us at around the same time frame
751	neg	This isn't right
752	pos	Not only does it keep the same overall design from the G402 which is the perfect size and shape for my larger hands
752	pos	It even improves on it, better gripping textures and free-scrolling mouse wheel make this a perfect fit for me
752	pos	Great build quality and a nice weight to it
753	pos	Well this will be short
753	pos	The only downside of this mouse is the broken scroll wheel
753	pos	Once you wear it out, it will break loose and will not function correctly
753	pos	Other than that, I’ve been killing it on valorant
753	pos	The sensor is amazing
753	pos	Just wish the material was more durable and higher quality
753	pos	The sensor doesn’t deserve such low quality plastic
753	pos	**UPDATE**I’m so stupid
753	pos	There’s a button that is solely for making the scroll wheel a free loose wheel
753	pos	Pressing it again will go back to its tactile normal scroll wheel
753	pos	I’m sorry
753	pos	This mouse is the best
754	neg	On new Macs this will be identified as a keyboard and won't work
754	neg	It will literally work as a mouse but that's it; software can't bind keys
754	neg	I spent a LONG time with Logitech confirming this
754	neg	Don't buy
755	neg	This mouse has been great no real issues till now, now i get double click
755	neg	March 30 2019 is when I bought this mouse that is just over a year
755	neg	I used to love Logitech but its like I'm chasing an old dream that is never as good as I once thought
755	neg	I started out with the Logitech G9x and built around Logitech for years
755	neg	I even bought into the headset (G430) and keyboard(G910)
755	neg	However now that's done, this is the second time replacing the G502 mouse for the same issue right about the same length of time
755	neg	I think what I will miss most is infinty scroll that was so nice
756	pos	Bought one because my wife/friends/entire internet seem to like the mouse, but it doesn't suit my grip
756	pos	I'm constantly accidentally clicking just by resting my fingers down because the actuation force is so low
756	pos	If I reposition to avoid that, I can't click the middle mouse button easily
757	pos	Havent bought a mouse in 6 years and thought of stickin with this family of mice
757	pos	I had the old g5 and it as weighted well, with supplied weights
757	pos	The new g5 is a bit less substantial but it makes up for that with a better hand design and many more buttons
757	pos	And an optional break on the wheel is cool
757	pos	Release the break and that wheel is well balanced and great for scrolling
757	pos	Great product
758	pos	Logitech nailing it again with button placement on this one
758	pos	Very responsive mouse with nice grip
758	pos	The extra buttons on the left click have become a necessity for me
758	pos	My only complaint is the "edgy gamer" design
758	pos	I'd prefer something a little more subtle and not as flashy
759	neg	The mouse has started double clicking when I click once
759	neg	This is a big issue when I try to highlight things or play any of my games
759	neg	I loved it when it was working but for how much I paid and how quickly it begun to stop working, just poor build quality
760	neg	So it's a really good mouse but, unfortunately, the insides are made of cheap material
760	neg	Notably, the mouse contacts/switches are really bad
760	neg	I had the mouse for barely a year and there was already double-clicking and rapid clicking (can't hold a mouse button down
760	neg	) I bought another one cause it was on sale and I honestly like this mouse, but I can't in good conscience recommend it for anyone else
760	neg	As soon as this new one wears out I'm switching brands
761	pos	I purchased this one to replace my old gaming mouse (same model) that lasted a full 6 years of heavy gaming
761	pos	My old mouse started having an issue with the middle mouse wheel button not working anymore when pressed
761	pos	At any rate, 6 years of hard core gaming I'm happy that my old mouse lasted that long
762	pos	The mouse works very well
762	pos	I really enjoy the added weights to the back of the mouse
762	pos	I only wish there was a way to lock the flap in place where the weights fit into the mouse but that's a fairly minor problem that only becomes annoying if the mouse falls onto the ground
762	pos	App works, buttons work, good feel
763	neg	I was really liking this mouse until the left mouse button starting acting up
763	neg	I loved the ability to lock the scroll wheel (or let it spin freely)
763	neg	After using it for about 8 months the left click started to release before I released the button and then it got worse and almost every click became double clicks making it pretty much useless
763	neg	I thought Logitech was better quality than this I'm still using my G-15 keyboard (12+ years later) but I guess I will have to look elsewhere for mice
764	neg	I bought this because I had purchased a gaming mouse a few years before and enjoyed it albeit it wasn't a well known company so when I did run into issues it was annoying
764	neg	I thought I was safe buying a logitech brand mouse
764	neg	apparently not, because within a few month the LMB single click became a double click 1/4th of the time which can cause havok when attempting even the simplest of Drag-and-drop tasks
764	neg	Do yourself a favor and do not buy Logitech products
765	neg	Left click fails to drag randomly
765	neg	Left click double clicks with a left click and hold
765	neg	Left click fail to even registar randomly
765	neg	Left click double click with a single click
765	neg	Logitech support is like a black hole
765	neg	Update
765	neg	The black hole finely sent me a replacementReplacement mouse fails the same way in less than 8 months
766	pos	Able to adjust the weight, just like the original one
766	pos	Great lightingGreat designFeels smooth and the buttons allow for quick change to settings
766	pos	You can also customize the button functions
766	pos	I’ve been using the G502 model for 3 - 4 years now
766	pos	Ever since I got this I fell in love with the fact that you can adjust the weight
766	pos	Although at first it was confusing to use with all the buttons
767	pos	So far, I like every feature of this mouse with no complaints
767	pos	I'll update this review if anything changes, but so far, a very solid purchase
767	pos	The app could be a little more user-friendly, but it's pretty easy to figure out after you wipe over your old profile a couple of times
767	pos	I haven't tried all of the features, and I do wish the RBG light display were more visible during use since your hand covers it up, but not really sure how you'd design around that either
768	pos	So i've been using this mouse since october of 2019 and let me say this is one of if not my favorite mouse that i've ever used
768	pos	That being said though, i am running into the right click double click issue as well as my left click not registering all the time
768	pos	For example, i usually play fps games (mainly escape from tarkov) and when i left click to shoot fully automatic, the gun sprays on an off
768	pos	Not sure if there's a fix for this
768	pos	I will try fixing on my own but if not then i'll be buying the same exact mouse again
768	pos	If it wasnt for the left and right click issue i would have gave this 5/5 stars
769	neg	In order to have your thumb half on on one of the side buttons and half on the other it must be held by your fingertips
769	neg	In that position you can't reach the DPI buttons or the lower side button without reaching out with your index finger or thumb
769	neg	The mouse I got also started to left double-click all by itself when you wanted to single-click after 7-8 weeks
769	neg	Too late  (past 30 days ) to send it back
769	neg	Now I have to try and deal with Logitech about Warranty
769	neg	Great
770	neg	Item stopped working literally within the first hour of being plugged in
770	neg	Light went out and mouse became unresponsive
770	neg	Plugged into another computer and same result
770	neg	Plugged my other G502 into the computer and it works perfectly so problem is definitely with the brand new mouse
770	neg	Disappointed because got it on sale and now can't get a proper replacement without paying extra
771	pos	A precise mouse with great buttons and tracking
771	pos	The mouse wheel can be used as a 3 way button, down, left and right
771	pos	While down is good, left and right are a bit wobbly as the wheel is not very secure side to side
771	pos	The slight bit of sloppy wobble makes using the left and right buttons of the wheel clunky and not a fine control movement
771	pos	Other than the left and right wheel functions the mouse is a solid performer
772	neg	For gaming, the mouse handed well
772	neg	And was easy to program
772	neg	Ergonomic, I have a average sized hand
772	neg	I found my ring finger sits almost directly on top of my pinky
772	neg	Which was uncomfortable
772	neg	Material quality, seems to have an average soft black plastic outside
772	neg	But the M2 button would occasionally become unresponsive to clicks
772	neg	Over all I found this to be an attractive gaming mouse
772	neg	It died too soon
773	pos	Sooo many buttons
773	pos	nice
773	pos	The weights you can add in don't make much difference to me, but I bet some people will like that feature
773	pos	I like especially that you can make the scroll-wheel smooth or clicky with just a button press
773	pos	Awesome
774	neg	Mouse is fine (so far) My complaint is mainly Logitech software forcing you to enroll in either full time spying or part time spying if you want to customize the DPI
774	neg	Why is the fact that I payed for the product NEVER enough for these companies
774	neg	If Corsair mice didn't have left click hardware failures, and Razor didn't have viruses built in to the driver install (Hello 2005 Sony rootkit fiasco) I'd have gone with them
774	neg	Can I justr get a ball mouse with a PS2 connector at this point
775	pos	the mouse itself is a good mouse
775	pos	fits perfectly in my hand
775	pos	i should of read the reviews before i purchase it though, i would of not bought it if i did
775	pos	the double clicking is annoying and very bad while trying to game or design; basically bad overall
775	pos	straight out of the box my middle mouse button does not work
775	pos	(like opening/closing a tab) i have installed the G HUB and update the drivers and it did not help
775	pos	i been using Logitech my whole life and i never had any problems with them before until this mouse
776	pos	Yes, this mouse is a bit on the heavier side but it is not a con for me
776	pos	The grips, buttons, and ergonomics of this mouse is of the best compared to other gaming mice
776	pos	I replaced my original G502 Proteus Spectrum with other gaming mice and I am glad to say that I am back with Logitech
776	pos	After trying out different gaming mice i have finally realized that no mouse could possibly be as good the the G502 mouse
776	pos	This product is really worth it and you will not be disappointing with your purchase
777	neg	If you have small hands it will work just fine but don’t buy this for gaming hoping you can remap the buttons don’t because you can’t only 2 side buttons and the main buttons are usable others only do computer functions and remapping there not game functions
778	pos	This gaming mouse has pretty much everything you would need from a gaming mouse
778	pos	Extra buttons for marcos, high refresh rate, adjustable weight, and RGB
778	pos	Bought it on sale to replace an older razer mouse and this has been a great mouse so far
779	pos	Been using it heavily now for the past several months and am very happy with it, both for gaming and for everyday tasks (YouTube, Reddit, email, etc
779	pos	) Look I figure if you're reading reviews for mice like this then you've done what I did, in watching review videos and 9+ tabs open with different options, so you already know what it's all about
779	pos	It felt good in my hand (claw but with more palm
779	pos	) and dialing in the weight made it feel better
779	pos	I play 400dpi so re-placing the mouse happens a lot, it feels solid when I do it
779	pos	Slight reverb in the wheel, but nothing I wouldn't expect
779	pos	Also, the free scrolling wheel is hilariously fun
779	pos	Only gripes I have so far is wanting more rgb and *seriously* that the dpi up button feels so on top of mouse1 that I found myself switching sens in the middle of a fight
779	pos	It became much less of a problem after two weeks or so of use, but I definitely still tell my teammates that's why I lost the fight
779	pos	I'm still happy with grabbing this, would recommend
780	neg	Compre el mouse hace un tiempo y lo uso solo jugar ocasionalmente, ayer note que no podia apuntar bien en shooter y me di cuenta del error de click izquierdo y entre a buscar informacion al respecto, me encontre con que muchas personas reportaban este error, una completa decepcion
781	pos	I don't game much, but this mouse has been great for productivity and video editing
781	pos	The software makes it super easy to customize and save a profile, and the RGB lighting is a bonus in the dark
781	pos	I don't mind the gamer-y aesthetic, but it'd be nice to have a matte option instead of the glossy plastic on some parts
782	pos	This is easily the best mouse out there for what it does
782	pos	There are enough extra buttons that they are useful without compromising the way you hold the mouse
782	pos	The weight is perfect and adjustable for those that like light or extremely heavy mice
782	pos	The previous version lasted me for almost 6 years, and even then the only issue was that the adhesive on the bottom mouse pads (helps the mouse glide smoothly) was wearing out
782	pos	I likely could have kept using it for a while but opted to support Logitech's commitment to durability and performance with purchasing a new one
782	pos	I recommend this mouse for essentially any use case
783	pos	Sure, it gets the job done, but it's no G700S, which is what I replaced with this
783	pos	Something about the angle on this one causes my computer to think that clicks are drags, also, so I often have to click something several times before it registers a click
784	neg	I purchased this because I needed a replacement for my older Logitech mouse
784	neg	However this one had some issues "clicking" on items and resolution wasn't very good
784	neg	I don't recommend
784	neg	Logitech needs to get back to the old "standard" of quality product
785	pos	You're probably scrolling through metric tons of reviews to see if they're legit
785	pos	I went 6 years on with a Logitech G700 Wired and that mouse had lasted me almost 7 years up; until now I've been through all kinds of mice and this one has seemed to outlast the others so far
785	pos	The weights that come with the mouse were kinda weird tbh
785	pos	At first glance it seemed to help in certain situations with mouse movement, but it wasn't so much different at all
785	pos	What I like about this mouse is the speed you can set your pointer at
785	pos	There are also some other nik-nacks I like about this mouse that I don't want to go forever on about
785	pos	I got this for about 55 dollars and I had a gift card with the purchase
785	pos	Overall this mouse so far it's great
785	pos	For more info, I've had this mouse since mid June of 2019
786	pos	I really liked the additional weights included
786	pos	The mouse itself feels great in the hand, and is a breeze to use gaming
786	pos	The only downside is that there isn't an up and down DPI button, just one that only goes up until it resets at the bottom of the dpi list
786	pos	Make sure to download Logitech G Hub to customize dpi settings, and other cool little additions, like light settings
787	pos	Enough buttons for a fps games
787	pos	Custom weights are great, which is why I keep coming back to this mouse
787	pos	Sole issue, back pads let go on the sharp edge
787	pos	Hopefully third ones a charm
788	pos	Feels great, works amazing, the DPI +/- buttons are not remapable, they can be turned off or assigned to a key press
788	pos	I didn't like the scroll wheel
788	pos	It's tactile turn just wasn't good feeling
788	pos	Hard to explain, but overall a good mouse
788	pos	I just prefer my M65
789	neg	It's unbelievable how terrible the logitech software is
789	neg	Every day I encounter the issue where the additional buttons don't work
789	neg	Only after restarting G-Hub (every day) I can get the functionality back
789	neg	Not to mention, the logitech software tools are fragmented and they seem to have an app per product
789	neg	:/
790	neg	Had this mouse for a few months before the left mouse button started acting extremely touchy
790	neg	This wasn't much of an issue as I could just change how I held the mouse to avoid accidental button inputs
790	neg	Now, just over a year after getting this mouse, I've been experiencing 'spinouts' on a somewhat frequent basis
790	neg	This mouse worked great for me besides these two flaws
790	neg	The touchy LMB has made playing some fps's very challenging, but was mainly just irritating
790	neg	This new spinout issue, however, is unacceptable for a mouse that's been used for just over one year when I've had cheaper mice last 3-4 years
790	neg	If you're willing to replace a product year after year, this IS a 4-5 star product
790	neg	But for me, at this pricepoint, I can't give more than 2 stars
791	pos	What a great mouse for the price
791	pos	Excellent weight with the adjustables
791	pos	Quality feels extremely premium pairs extremely nicely with my Logitech g 802 keyboard
792	pos	Update #2: Within a week, Logitech had a replacement at my door
792	pos	back up to 4 stars, will return if the new one starts to malfunction in an unreasonable amount of time
792	pos	Update: Hasn't been 2 months yet and right click is starting to fail
792	pos	Outside of Amazon return window, currently have warranty request pending through Logitech
792	pos	Good mouse, clicks feel good, button variety is great
793	pos	Got this mouse for my rig, which hasn't all arrived yet, so I am using it with my "current" pc
793	pos	Full linux support out of the box
793	pos	It comes baked in with some pretty great settings
793	pos	nice feel, it feels like this mouse is the other half to my hand
793	pos	The cable is nice and flexible
793	pos	The biggest thing I can say is full linux support
793	pos	I run ubuntu mate as my daily driver OS, and this thing is perfect
793	pos	Full RGB control using the openRGB project, and full button mapping support from piper
793	pos	A must have for linux gamers imo, its a good mouse, and looks to be fully supported
794	pos	I had a G502 for five (eight maybe) plus, years
794	pos	I had to replace the plastic pads on the other side a couple times, but it was a champion and didn't exactly fail, but lost the distinct click in the right button
794	pos	This mouse is the much-updated version with control of the lighting effects and higher resolution
794	pos	It feels the same software with the added features
794	pos	It is a great design I'm glad to see Logitech sticking to something that works
795	pos	After using this mouse for a few months, so far so good
795	pos	The mouse has done more than what I can imagine
795	pos	The multiple keys on the mouse has made things very convenient for me and the speed and quality of the mouse is more than expected
795	pos	TBH, I would order another one just for a spare because this mouse has been amazing
795	pos	I am still waiting to see the occurring problems with the mouse wheel from other reviewers
795	pos	It has not happened to me yet, so far so good
796	pos	I've been buying cheaper gaming mice for years, and they always break down fast, and feel cheap
796	pos	This mouse is perfect for me so far, the clicks feel really good, and the low dpi "sniping" button is perfect
796	pos	It also feels great in the hand, the thumb rest is great, and the infinite scroll function has been way more useful then I thought it would
797	pos	Been using the G502 model for years for different uses such as gaming, browsing, and coding
797	pos	It hasn't failed me once in any of those aspects
797	pos	I love the amount of buttons it has, very useful for gaming
797	pos	It always felt great on my hand
797	pos	Highly recommend this mouse
798	pos	I bought this mouse because it was reviewed as fitting larger hands
798	pos	My hands are decently large, with long fingers
798	pos	I can say that I don't ever experience fatigue when using the mouse
798	pos	It's easily customizable and very responsive
798	pos	For the price, I couldn't beat it
799	neg	Overall the mouse functions amazingly, however it suffers from durability issues
799	neg	I've gone through two G502 Hero mice, one I bought here, one I got as a replacement for it from Logitech Support
799	neg	Both mice functioned perfectly the first couple months, but after about 2-3 months of normal use the Right Click button starts becoming unreliable
799	neg	Initially it's very subtle but as time goes on it becomes more and more pronounced
799	neg	Sometimes you get one right click and it works fine, other times you get two or more right clicks with a single press, and sometimes nothing at all
799	neg	Not the end of the world if you're browsing the web but any gaming mechanic that depends on exactly one right click or a right click and hold becomes unpredictable
799	neg	After getting two of the G502 Hero from two different sources (Amazon and Logitech Support) and both showing the same problem in such a short period of time, I absolutely recommend you DO NOT buy this mouse
800	pos	I was skeptical at first because some people seem to have problems with these and a couple of other brands regarding clicking, maybe they play a little too hardcore in FPS games but for everyday use it works perfectly fine for me
800	pos	Still early to tell but lets see where it ends up a couple more months down the line
800	pos	Hoping it lasts me years but who knows
801	neg	The scroll wheel is waayyyy to loose for me
801	neg	I play your typical games fortnite, cod, etc
801	neg	editing is almost impossible cause the wheel spins an extra click
801	neg	Other than that, Great mouse
801	neg	Has weights you can adjust at the bottom
801	neg	The killer is the very loose scroll wheel
802	pos	I always thought mice with a ton of extra buttons were over the top, but I wish I would have purchased this mouse years ago
802	pos	I use it for gaming and work (I’m a software engineer), and it is bar none the best mouse I’ve ever used
802	pos	I love the on-board profiles and how easy it is to switch between them
802	pos	I have large hands, and most mice are too small
802	pos	I usually end up having to roll my pinky under my ring finger, which causes discomfort after prolonged use
802	pos	This mouse fits my hand perfectly, and I feel like I could use it for hours
802	pos	I would buy this mouse again in a heartbeat
803	pos	More mice than I need, I don't do gaming but need a high-resolution mouse
803	pos	Con: the left button sometimes requires multiple actuation to work
803	pos	I guess that has been a problem with this mouse for a long time
804	pos	Husband's only complaint is he can't figure out how to set up the On Board Memory with this mouse
804	pos	He hasn't really looked into and will end up getting his brother to help him set it up but he's over all content with the mouse and use of it :)
805	pos	I’ve been using the G502 for years now, just bought my own for my new setup and it has such a nice feel to it
805	pos	I don’t use all the weights provided so it can feel a little lighter, but the whole idea of being able to adjust the weight is amazing
805	pos	I also like the amount of buttons the mouse has, definitely not too many to confuse me, but just enough for me to bind essential things to the buttons
805	pos	This is an essential gaming mouse, it’s all around balanced and will last you years easily
806	pos	Has cool features, and the hardware feels sturdy
806	pos	The design is awesome and I love the scroll wheel, not sure why people give the wheel hate it feels great
806	pos	Haters gonna hate I guess
806	pos	I wish they made the G502 slightly bigger for people with big hands (I am coming off a Rival 300), but size wise, it is 98% perfect for me
806	pos	I love the weight of this mouse too
806	pos	Was a great buy
807	neg	I honestly feel there should be some call of lawsuit for logitech to fix there products, logitech quality has been going down and what happened to being the world class for mice and keyboards
807	neg	yo logitech you suck fix the mouse issue, im tired of missing my snipes with the right button issue
808	neg	The good:This mouse is everything you could want in a wired mouse
808	neg	Excellent surface tracking, no pointer spazziness, an adjustable weight cartridge, and great button feel
808	neg	The bad:This mouse has a design flaw in the buttons which cause them to sometimes click twice instead of once
808	neg	The latest driver update "debounces" the clicks, reducing the problem, but it still happens sometimes
809	neg	This gaming mouse is absolute garbage, I have had 2 now and BOTH had intermittent left and right mouse buttons making it absolutely worthless for gaming and pretty terrible for anything else
809	neg	Non-existent support which is too bad because logitech used to be so good
809	neg	Do not buy this mouse, pick just about anything else for a better experience
810	pos	Good mouse
810	pos	One tip though: the mouse did not work correctly with my old mousepad
810	pos	Apparently this mouse is a little picky with them
810	pos	Had to buy a new mouse pad and now it is more than fine
811	pos	I've always used the generic mouse's used for business, and most of them really are limited to what you can do with them, but with this mouse you have a lot of options and buttons to choose from
811	pos	Highly recommend getting this
812	pos	The best mouse for this price point and even 150 dollar mice
812	pos	Very ergonomic, has great quality, the G-Hub user interface is practically perfect, macros are easy enough to set up, and the price is really really great
812	pos	Overall one of my favorite mice to use on a day-to-day basis
813	neg	When you hook the mouse up, the dpi changes on its on a lot
813	neg	randomly
813	neg	the adjustment buttons are attatched to the left click of the mouse
813	neg	so thats genius as well
813	neg	after downloading the logitech hub to fix these problems, i turned off all ability to adjust the dpi on the mouse and discovered that it will randomly stop inputting and it will freeze for a second
813	neg	as a gaming mouse
813	neg	this is totally crazy as a design flaw
813	neg	what worse is i see these same complaints going back a few years, so they just don't care
813	neg	what an expensive paperweight this mouse is
814	neg	Mouse started off great, but literally days after Logitech's 2-year warranty the mouse would release left/right holds
814	neg	I've been a loyal customer since 2005, but Logitech's refusal to replace their blatantly faulty products has pushed me to Razer
814	neg	A $80 mouse should last much, much longer than 2 years
814	neg	I strongly suggest anyone looking at this mouse (or any Logitech product for that matter) to look elsewhere
815	pos	This is my second G502 I've been using this mouse for the last 6 years or so and love it
815	pos	Has all the features I need including programmable buttons an in the fly DPI reduction button, and you can customize the LED lighting, I also love the mouse wheel that can be unlocked
816	neg	Left to right, based on age, the one of the left is the only one that works without some sort of defect, it  is the oldest, before they cheapened it for mass production, the rest are junk
816	neg	I won't even get into the crap software, Logitech has 3 software platforms , Logitech G, G hub, and Logitech options
816	neg	The oldest app is the only semi-reliable one, but it doesn't find any new mice past the G502, least the ones I have, like the, MX vertical (options), and G903 (G Hub)
816	neg	I have at least 8 Logitech mice right now, I tried
817	pos	El mouse trabaja perfectamente súper bien,pero después de 2 mese de uso he estado teniendo problemas con el clip derecho ,cuando juego un shooter game que apunto al momento deja de hacerlo y después lo vuelve a hacer ,he buscando en youtube y he hecho todo lo posible por repararlo y nada ,pero a demás de eso es muy bueno para jugar
818	pos	First legit gaming mouse i've owned and i'm not disappointed
818	pos	Other than the software not showing up no matter how many times i troubleshoot it's a great mouse
818	pos	It may be a bit narrow as i have large hands i can not complain
818	pos	The numerous buttons to macro are phenomenal
818	pos	The mouse glides freely on my mousepad
818	pos	The mouse wheel is great
818	pos	I saw some reviews on how their mouse wheel "broke" and won't stop moving
818	pos	The button south of your wheel locks it in place or lets it free spin
818	pos	I love the free spin when i'm scrolling down a long internet page or searching for music
818	pos	Makes it easier
818	pos	Overall a great purchase and i would recommend
819	neg	Double click issue
819	neg	impossible to game with when the mouse Auto clicks every few seconds
819	neg	Total trash and that's where it went after I tried to repair myself
819	neg	They device should not even be allowed to be sold
819	neg	It is damaged out of the box
819	neg	AVOID
820	neg	Was not made to last
820	neg	In one year the left button stops working at times
820	neg	The worst for Shooters
820	neg	Thought it was good at first
820	neg	If you don't play shooters
820	neg	i guess wot will be ok
821	neg	Mouse is out of warranty
821	neg	Doubleclick issue is very real
821	neg	Annoying at best, but it can also cost you closed windows, deleted data, and more
821	neg	A serious problem for such an expensive mouse
821	neg	Worse, this issue has gone on for YEARS and Logitech, apparently, has no interest in fixing it
821	neg	Move on to another maker
822	pos	The Logitech G502 Hero is now my favorite mouse to use and I've owned a slew of different brands, the brilliant performance of this mouse gives me all the buttons I'll need, adjustable weights and the new software G Hub works flawlessly
822	pos	This is in my opinion the best wired gaming mouse one can buy
823	pos	The deal with Logitech products is that there is basically no warranty once the retailers return period (usually 30 days) ends
823	pos	There are literally hundreds of people trying to file warranty claims with no response
823	pos	No one ever responds to the cases online or answers the phone
823	pos	I made the mistake of buying this mouse after I found out that their warranty stinks
823	pos	I may return it just to buy something else
824	pos	I currently use a G402 and wanted to upgrade to a mouse with weights to improve play with my hand tremors
824	pos	Compared to the G402 wheel, the wheel on the G502 is large and "clunky
824	pos	" The feel and scrolling was inferior to the G402
824	pos	It also seems that there is farther space between the "clicks
824	pos	" In the 20 minutes or so I worked with it, I couldn't adjust
825	pos	The mouse itself is good, the software for it does not work, at all, it doesn't even detect the mouse making it useless as a gaming mouse
825	pos	Update: Use the Logitech G HUB software and not the Logitech Gaming software the instructions tell you to use
826	pos	Love this mouse more than any other i have owned
826	pos	Haven’t owned a wired mouse in ages, but the new PC build wasn’t working well with my wireless mouse & keyboard
826	pos	Doing CAD work and 3D model/ rendering workflow daily
826	pos	Only negative note was wanting to swap out the scroll wheel
826	pos	Easy solution via eBay and the slimmer typical scroll wheel swap people have done with this model
826	pos	Now I have the worlds most perfect mouse that is programmed to do so many things
826	pos	It allows me to work 20% faster
827	neg	This used to be my favorite mouse now it seems they make garbage I do not recommend left click double clicks and will not let you drag windows had mouse for 65 days got new mouse today from BenQ Zowie EC1
827	neg	Logitech used to make such long lasting good products guess that day is dead
828	pos	Could not of made a better choice buying this mouse
828	pos	It's super sensitive and feel great in the hand
828	pos	It won't make you better at games if that's what you think you need to be better is a better mouse
828	pos	It will shave milliseconds off response time but it won't make you a better shot
828	pos	😂
829	pos	Has what you need with a few extras, good software to customize DPI and button settingsRBG colors and automatically changes with supported games (most mainstream)Scroll Wheel is metal and cold to touch, has hyper scroll button
830	pos	Great device and easy to use
830	pos	But the software on a Mac sometimes leaves things to be desired
830	pos	But thats Logitech for you
830	pos	Mac is more of an afterthought it seems
830	pos	But the mouse itself is quite good, responsive, reads well and is easy adjustable
831	neg	Bought the mouse, side lights defected and wouldn’t work
831	neg	Didn’t care at first but if I pay my money I want everything working perfectly
831	neg	Ordered a replacement and I had the same exact issue with the SECOND mouse
831	neg	Side lights on the mouse is defected and won’t turn on, unless you unplug and plug your mouse back in, and at that point it’ll last for 2 minutes
831	neg	Googling it, many other people have had the same issue with this mouse
831	neg	Decent mouse but if I’m spending money on something I want it to come how it’s suppose to
832	neg	Had the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum for a long time, best mouse I’ve ever used
832	neg	Decided to upgrade to the HERO since I love the features of the Spectrum
832	neg	Bought on Amazon for $48 on sale
832	neg	Came used with finger prints all over the mouse feet, wheel, and the weights
832	neg	Normally I wouldn’t care but since this an everyday product for me, I returned it
832	neg	Ended up going to my local micro center and bought the same mouse for 9$ more
832	neg	At least I know this wasn’t an opened box item put into new packaging
833	neg	Double clicking started just 1 year of using
833	neg	Its really annoying and not usable anymore
834	pos	I gotta say I seriously love this mouse
834	pos	I upgraded from some off brand crappy mouse that was still decent but I felt like it really needed an upgrade and it was definitely worth every penny
834	pos	The colors are beautiful
834	pos	The mouse is super comfortable
834	pos	The DPI settings are customizable and you can switch through DPI settings so fast
834	pos	Worth the buy for sure
835	pos	The reason why I give 2 is because this mouse has just too many pointed/sharp edges, which I feel is bad in terms of ergonomics
835	pos	Also the clicky roll up down switch has a pretty sharp feedback
835	pos	Now all that is good for gaming and I understand that, but unfortunately I just couldn't use this mouse for reading purposes
835	pos	To all the gamers, this is an amazing mouse
835	pos	To people who do gaming and office work/reading, not really sure I would recommend it
836	neg	I actually really liked this mouse but it started developing a click issue on the left mouse button where it double clicks or releases while you're holding the button
836	neg	Makes drag and drop or selecting text nearly impossible
836	neg	After cleaning the mouse it still did this
836	neg	Next I searched online and found other people having the same issues and that it was pointing to a hardware issue
836	neg	It's great when it works but the low rating is because a mouse at this price range shouldn't break in 9 months
837	pos	I love everything about this mouse except for one quirk
837	pos	I play Counterstrike mostly
837	pos	When you hold down left click to shoot you have to pull down to compensate for recoil
837	pos	In a competitive match when it gets tense sometimes I will press left click too hard and the back end of the mouse will come off the pad
837	pos	Then when I go to pull down the mouse doesn't move at all because the sensor is off the pad
837	pos	It will cost me kills sometimes
837	pos	Other than that 10/10
838	pos	Arrived on time and undamaged
838	pos	I set it to where it reacts to the audio to get more fun out of it
838	pos	It's bulkier than the one I had before, noticed it's moving faster on the screen
838	pos	It's definitely a whole lot less laggy than the Redragon gaming mouse
838	pos	I like the thumb rest and extra buttons to create shortcuts
839	pos	This is the best gaming mouse I’ve bought
839	pos	It just feels right and with all the programmable buttons it makes it easier to play games
839	pos	Also with software installed you could literally customize it however you need
839	pos	I’ve also have the G-series pad and this mouse works very well combined with it
839	pos	The speed is amazing
839	pos	There are weights you can add
839	pos	I’ve always been a Logitech fan, and every time hasn’t failed me
839	pos	Best mouse ever
840	neg	Purchased this mouse to replace an old mouse that started with the double click issues after about 3 or so years
840	neg	I had that mouse a long time so I thought it was fine, I could get another mouse, but this mouse started having the double click issues on the left click and general clicking issues on the right click after only 4 months
840	neg	Contacting Logitech support to try to get this fixed is slow and that has just soured the whole experience for me
841	neg	The mouse feels great, but it causes issues with all of my games
841	neg	World of warcraft, mechwarrior 5, when i move the mouse, the games drop frames
841	neg	Moving using the keyboard is fine
841	neg	I changed mice, and I have no graphics issues
841	neg	Buyer beware
841	neg	Edit: raised to two stars because I was able to get it to work much better by lowering the poll refresh rate to the lowest setting
841	neg	It seems like it’s an industry thing because I bought a corsair mouse and had the same issue
842	pos	The mouse is a good mouse but the scroll wheel is so loose that I have to stick something on the side to be able to use it
842	pos	When it is working properly it is a very good mouse to use, the problem is it just doesn't work consistently
842	pos	Also the sensitivity seems to change on it's own
843	pos	Upgraded from a basic left click right click wheel mouse
843	pos	this thing is crazy with more buttons than i know what to do with
843	pos	i really enjoy being able to set the speed of my cursor an flip through my different settings for different tasks
843	pos	but the best feature is the Sniper Button
843	pos	being able to get to a target fast and then put your cursor in slow mo is the best part about this mouse for me
843	pos	highly recommend this mouse, had it for over a month now with zero issues
844	neg	This mouse would be fine if it didn't suffer from one fatal flaw: it constantly double-clicks when you attempt a single click
844	neg	Need to drag a window
844	neg	There's a chance it will shrink your window and then close it
844	neg	Selecting a piece of text is an absolute chore because it constantly double-clicks when you need a single click
844	neg	Gaming is ridiculous because there's no precision
844	neg	I've been trying to "live with it" for the past few months since I bought it until I can afford a mouse that isn't a POS but this stupid thing just closed what I was working on and I lost about an hour of work for my day job, because it double-clicks almost every time I try to do a single click, so now I'm writing this review
844	neg	Absolutely broken, DO NOT BUY
845	neg	The part in the manual about changing Profiles and DPI settings makes no sense
845	neg	Was it translated to English from  Mandarin
845	neg	I play warzone CoD and if I switch into windows and back into the game the DPI settings are all screwed up
845	neg	Nice mouse, horrible software/drivers
846	neg	This is the 3rd iteration of what is basically the same mouse
846	neg	Never buy this mouse at full 75 dollar price
846	neg	I've had two before and both have had trouble
846	neg	The first one where the side button broke and the second where the left click button started slipping to the left
846	neg	The build quality of the mouse is pretty poor and honestly has been getting worse over the 3 generations this mouse has had
846	neg	This will be the last Logitech mouse I buy
846	neg	EDIT the left mouse button is now double-clicking because of the  Omron switches this mousie uses
846	neg	I am applying for an RMA lets see what happens :(
847	neg	Pros: The buttons are easy to reach and I like how easy it is to customize
847	neg	Comfortable to hold
847	neg	Cons: The two primary buttons are glitchy
847	neg	They work fine for clicking, but try to drag-and-drop and it drops too early
847	neg	Both left and right buttons are like that
847	neg	It makes work and games very frustrating
847	neg	Barely lasted a year
847	neg	Better off with a $10 disposable mouse at that rate
848	pos	The logo always glows
848	pos	even when i set it to not glow with the downloaded settings program, if i put my computer to sleep, the computer stops running the settings program and then my mouse glows in the dark
848	pos	really annoyed by this because i did not want a glowing g shaped nightlight for my room, since my desk is right next to my bed
848	pos	really wish the settings program worked when my computer is asleep so i dont have to unplug my mouse all the time
849	pos	Soea what it is supposed to, it used to be switching dpi by itself which wasn't choosing the right one for the program being used, but I think I found how to disable it
850	pos	perfect size for my large hands, feels great once you put the max weights in it, the logitech G app is kind of a pain to figure out, game profiles are useless, just disable them and configure it manually
851	neg	This broke after less than a full; year of use
851	neg	Have tried to contact support - but after 20 minutes on hold , left message
851	neg	No return call that day or the following day
851	neg	Tried calling again - left on hold and gave up after 10 minutes
851	neg	I think my son was happy with it when it worked, but for nearly 80 dollars, it should last more than a year
852	neg	I never seen a mouse so, small as this one
852	neg	Must be made for a teenager, but not a 39 year old adult
852	neg	Guess, I will keep my old mouse until they make a new one like the G500 series
853	pos	ive had been using different mouses in my life BUT THIS is one of a kind
853	pos	its cool looking
853	pos	i like the whole weight added to it and the RGB lightning really makes my setup intense
853	pos	besides that as a gaming mouse its the best for shooters so far for me
853	pos	each one should experience what mouse is good for them but i myself totally prefer this one
853	pos	for me this mouse is a must by if youre a gamer
854	neg	Lower my rating even further after dealing with support
854	neg	Logitech has done everything they can think of to not honor the warranty on this faulty mouse
854	neg	I will never use another Logitech product again
854	neg	On top of a bad product, they have wasted many hours of my time
854	neg	Filthy
855	pos	Pros--RGB-Great feel-super responsive-unlockable scroll wheel-Great software-Nice sounding clicksCons--Not as large as the g602 which i was hoping it was due to my larger hands-Grease finger magnet
856	pos	Just upgraded from a cheaper product and WOW
856	pos	Huge difference
856	pos	I am new to gaming so learning the keyboard and mouse still
856	pos	Had grabbed a cheaper mouse first and after a week it was killing me
856	pos	Made it so much harder to learn with
856	pos	After receiving this I couldn't believe how much better it made the gameplay feel
856	pos	Well worth the extra buckets ;)
857	neg	I've used all of the troubleshooting methods, but the right-click is still being inconsistent
857	neg	To be more specific whenever I play FPS games, my aim is toggled, furthermore, my game looks like its switching back and forth throughout the game when aiming
857	neg	I've tried everything from reinstalling my drivers, binding different buttons, etc
857	neg	I've taken extremely good care of my mouse, but, for some reason, the mouse has given up on me, and I know for a fact that I have not reached the 20 million clicks you've advertised the mouse to last to
857	neg	Thank you for your time
858	pos	Had one of these for 4 years now and loved it
858	pos	Recently I started a new job and this mouse wasn't on the employer provided list
858	pos	I ended up buying a 2nd out of my own pocket because I love it so much
858	pos	The cord is light, braided and long enough that you never notice it
858	pos	Buttons are placed in seemingly the perfect locations that seem natural
858	pos	The customization through the logitech program is extensive
858	pos	Overall I dont have a desire to even try another mouse
859	neg	Very small mouse, doesn't want to sit flat, when you drag the mouse to the right it wants to roll over, only 2 of the 11 buttons are actually programable, the dpi adjustment buttons are too big and take up 1/3 of the space of the left mouse button, mouse 3-4 are way to far back you have to hold the mouse in a very awkward half contact position to access them
859	neg	F all around, horrible mouse
860	pos	This is a productivity beast, it has about 9-10 usable buttons, with one you can set as a modifier to double your programmable buttons to 18-20
860	pos	The software can be for specific app content as well
860	pos	So I have it orange for gaming and for my work
860	pos	My only complaint is the mouse software sometimes doesn’t wake from sleep and needs to be killed and restarted, in this case the basic functionality works but your macros aren’t viable
861	pos	I was doing some research before I bought this to my boyfriend
861	pos	After wfh the mouse click noise always annoying me
861	pos	Since I’m a pianist that I’m very sensitive with the noise
861	pos	We had several conversations about the mouse noise, however, after I bought this one, the trouble disappeared
861	pos	My boyfriend loves it
862	pos	This mouse has worked well, especially for the price
862	pos	Unfortunately at some point it started having issues where it would double click and the mouse button would stick
862	pos	If you click a bunch of times and apply pressure it goes away, however it's still an annoying issue to have for gaming
863	pos	The mouse has been great, smooth
863	pos	The weights are wonderful and precise, the customization is appreciated
863	pos	Everything works great, but sometimes randomly in games i will experience my player swing around in a random direction- just spin 360 degrees
863	pos	Sometimes it happens nonstop or consistently spaced apart in time
863	pos	And sometimes it happens once, and then never again
863	pos	It's weird, and it's definitely obnoxious when I'm in a competitive match
863	pos	Has gotten me killed more than once lol
864	pos	I will start by saying I have small hands and its a little too big for me
864	pos	I've had it for a couple of weeks and have learned how to place my hands so I can access all the buttons
864	pos	I really enjoy the ease of setting the "macro" buttons
864	pos	The subtle shape of the rounded part where your hand rests is very comfortable
864	pos	Other than the "getting to know you'' with the size, its everything I needed in a gaming mouse
864	pos	Over-all I am pleased with this mouse purchase :)
865	pos	I have tried many mice
865	pos	I had this one a while back (with the previous sensor version) and loved it but my dog got to the cord
865	pos	So I decided to try all the other "top" computer mice like the razer death adder (no idea who razer is paying to get this one on the list)
865	pos	But I eventually came back to this mouse
865	pos	I love the weight adjustments and the buttons are laid out perfectly for my hands
866	pos	This mouse looks good, feels good, and can adjust to any usage type
866	pos	This is not plug and play
866	pos	You’ll have to download G hub on your computer, but it gives you some pretty cool setting options
867	neg	Like other reviews have said(and I should have listened) this mouse has major issues with the mouse wheel and tracking, upon first using the mouse I saw that it had issues scrolling and took almost a full wheel revolution just to move up or down, so I would have to constantly spin the wheel over and over just to move inches at a time
867	neg	The mouse tracking was also off and would jump around, but the wheel was by far the most annoying issue
868	neg	Great features and ergonomics, but the infamous mouse clicking issue began after 6 months of use
868	neg	I first noticed that the right mouse button was releasing prematurely during right-click and drag about 50% of the time
868	neg	Now the left button is double-clicking on a single click 30-50% of the time
868	neg	I'm now using my 15-year old Logitech basic mouse that still works flawlessly
869	neg	Mouse has a great ergonomic shape and weight, but scroll wheel is awful
869	neg	Its made of metal and has almost no grip, so it slips around and is very imprecise
870	pos	Logitech still ranks top tier in gaming and the G502 is no exception
870	pos	The wheel is a real treat and the tactile feel between side to side motion is top notch
870	pos	Contours perfectly to my hand, ymmw
871	pos	Male with average sized hands, but I found this mouse to be too cramped with buttons
871	pos	After a week or 2 of trying to get used to it, I eventually had to disable the top 'G8' button, because I frequently misclicked it in games
871	pos	The left click button feels too small and narrow for my preferences at least
871	pos	I also never use the 'G4' button because it's too small and tucked too far behind my thumb
871	pos	Performed great otherwise, but definitely a warning that if you have larger hands this mouse may be too cramped to make use of all features
872	neg	I have had to replace this mouse a total of 4 times because after only a few months of use, the mouse starts to double click every time I single click
872	neg	I'm glad Logitech is sticking to their warranty and replacing it, but this is a joke
872	neg	I've been using Logitech for more than 15 years and there is no excuse for this poor quality
872	neg	Fix your switches or stop making mice
872	neg	Awful purchase
873	neg	This is made in the cheapest fashion possible
873	neg	Switches wore out after nine months of medium to light use and couldn't get a replacement
873	neg	The features are decent, the software is frustrating, the ergonomics are ok only
874	pos	Great mouse overall, not sure if this is a QA oversight or what
874	pos	The right click does not fully register makes it a pain when "aiming down sights" in any FPS game
874	pos	Love the mouse overall, just wish it would made it past a year of gaming
875	neg	The mouse performs basic functions, but the software used to edit mouse functionality (Logitech G Hub) is not yet compatible with Mac OS Big Sur 11
875	neg	6
875	neg	It's essentially a high-tech paperweight without access to G Hub
876	pos	Best gaming mouse I've ever owned
876	pos	So good I have 2 extras still unopened in case my main ever breaks, and have bought them for friends and family who needed a new (or better) mouse
876	pos	Love it
876	pos	Easily worth the money
877	pos	I've bought my fair share of those "Gaming" mice with all of their fancy colors, designs, buttons, and whatnot
877	pos	They don't compare at all
877	pos	It was well worth the money I spent on this
877	pos	If you like a heavy mouse, this is the way to go
877	pos	It's got all you'll ever need for a great gaming experience
878	pos	I always found gaming mice handy in design work due to so many programmable keys that you can map to your day to day routine plus you can select more than one profile which gives you a lot of potential
878	pos	Also you can manipulate DPI which is something important for photoshop, illustrator, figma, etc
879	neg	I really liked this mouse
879	neg	Then the right click mouse sensor stopped working consistently
879	neg	I use this for gaming and it really sucks using it now
879	neg	It is just out of the return time frame on Amazon so I guess I will try reaching logitech
879	neg	Talked to other friends who game and they confirmed that they had similar issues with Hero mouses
880	pos	It’s a good quality mouse, I fixed one for a friend and just from testing it I wanted to get one for myself
880	pos	It’s good for the games I play, but precise enough for FPS games
880	pos	Weight can be added to make it heavier which I like, and the scroll wheel can be locked or unlocked so it scrolls freely which is great for scrolling through many pages
881	pos	I got this for my son for Christmas
881	pos	He's only had it for about 2 weeks or so now but loves it so far
881	pos	It was one of his favorite gifts he received
882	neg	This mouse is known to be reliable over everything else
882	neg	Due to the reputation it has carried through the years I did not feel the need to read into it as much as I would for a mouse I have never heard of but beware
882	neg	Turns out there is a huge issue with the LM button double clicking when you click once
882	neg	It makes it UNUSABLE
882	neg	I edit video, audio, and play video games and the frustration of doing any of those things with a double clicking mouse is unmatched
882	neg	I've had the thing for 3 months
882	neg	I have been in the warranty process with Logitech for two months now and it is still NOT resolved
882	neg	The hoops you jump through are almost not worth a replacement
882	neg	If I ordered a $10 mouse I would not be as livid but FIFTY DOLLARS
882	neg	Stay clear of this product
882	neg	That's all I can say
882	neg	Everything was great subtracting the most basic function of a mouse: to click stuff
883	neg	I jumped through the hoops, downloaded the G Hub so I could check for firmware updates
883	neg	Updated the firmware and it did not fix the physical button defects in my mouse
883	neg	Seeing plenty of other reviews saying the exact same thing
883	neg	I used to swear by Logitech, guess it's time I move on
884	pos	I received this mouse in march of 2019
884	pos	Nothing has changed it still feels like i just got it out of the box, this mouse is very  durable
884	pos	it has 8 programmable buttons as well as a ability to change the scroll wheel from slow to endless
884	pos	You can change the RGB in the very complicated G hub but once yo figure it out it is very rewarding and has almost endless features
884	pos	The mouse also comes with weights even though it is heavy by itself
884	pos	But a heavy or light mouse does not matter when you have a dpi above 800 in my opinion
884	pos	Very great mouse it definitely deserves to be as popular as it is
884	pos	5/5
885	pos	I'm a person who will research days on end to find what makes me feel like a good fair purchase and honestly, I wish I pulled the trigger quicker with this mouse
885	pos	It's affordable, super light (comes with weights if needed), fits my large hands perfectly, and reacts quickly to my movements
885	pos	Would recommend 100%
886	pos	I have stayed away from Logitech for over 10 years
886	pos	Everything I have owned of theirs would break so fast
886	pos	This mouse has been amazing
886	pos	It feels good
886	pos	The app works well so you can macro it
886	pos	And you can write Lua scripts for it using Logitech’s API
887	neg	I really expected something more
887	neg	The quality of the mouse itself it's good but the mouse grip or sliders are terrible
887	neg	I received it today and after 1 hour of playing, one of the sliders came off and now this mouse feels just terrible, besides it just keeps scratching my mouse pad
888	pos	Got this on sale for about half off, which is nice becausey old G502 needed it's left mouse button replaced
888	pos	This is just like the old one with some quality of life improvements, especially being able to add weights
888	pos	There's a reason this has been among the top mice for years now
888	pos	If you can afford spending a little extra on a mouse, it doesn't get much better in this price range
889	pos	I actually bought this for work, not for gaming
889	pos	The extra functions and macros save me so much time and keyboard clicks
889	pos	Can't recommend this enough
889	pos	*Note there are different software options to change button config
889	pos	I liked "Logitech Gaming Software 9
889	pos	02
889	pos	65" better than the one off the Logitech product page
889	pos	Button config and creating macros is easy
890	pos	Solid premium product don't waste time with those cheap fancy looking no name brands
890	pos	This is an excellent mouse for animation or post production work, and that script feature gives the edge in COD and Battlefield games
891	neg	The mouse in and of itself is a wonderful piece of technology and with the appropriate software you can customize it and make it your own, which is all well and good when it works
891	neg	Chances are, however, that the switches inside will probably bork and you'll develop issues with the left click where you will have difficulty double-clicking or click-and-dragging stuff, which definetly becomes a problem when you're trying to play a game with the damn thing
892	pos	Been using this mouse (G502 Hero) for several years and love it for my gaming
892	pos	11 buttons that are easy to use with out hitting the wrong one
892	pos	Would like it to be just a little bit bigger, larger hands make it feel a bit small, but that's usually the case
893	pos	Even with all the weights installed, this thing is pretty light weight
893	pos	The scroll and movement are very smooth and the cord is so light if feels cordless
893	pos	The software isn't the most intuitive but makes this mouse highly customizable
893	pos	I have large dual monitors and at roughly half the capable sensitivity I can get from one side to the other with a flick of the wrist
894	neg	I bought this for my 14-year-old son, who had worked to earn it
894	neg	I presumed it was fine, but last night I asked how he was enjoying it and he said I can't use it
894	neg	Apparently, it came with a couple of manufacturer defects
894	neg	The bottom outside corner of the mouse trackpad (a gel-like surface) is not smooth, which affects the speed, action, and accuracy during gaming
894	neg	Additionally, it came wiith a very sharp burr in the same location that had damaged his mouse pad when he tried to use it
894	neg	I tried gently to take a soft nail file to the burr, hoping it might help, but it was not an effective solution, as the gel-like surface began to lift at the location of the burr
894	neg	My
895	neg	After a little over a year of use, the left mouse button starts malfunctioning
895	neg	When I try to hold the left button and drag the mouse, it just released the button by itself
895	neg	And sometimes doesn't respond when I click
896	pos	i had the previous version, without the hero sensor and logitech hit it out of the park
896	pos	great response quality and feel
896	pos	have had no issues getting it to track on any material
896	pos	its just a great mouse for gaming over all
897	pos	My Razer Naga broke prior to purchasing this mouse and for someone with fairly large hands and a "claw" grip the ergonomics and button-placement are some of my favorite features
897	pos	The scroll-wheel is a nice to have
897	pos	Software is great
897	pos	I run three profiles offline that are saved to the physical mouse so if I change computers my settings are there
897	pos	My only complaint is it's a bit heavy for a gaming mouse especially if you play at low DPI (I play at 400) so grabbing a mouse bungee like the Zowie Camade makes a big difference
898	neg	Got this mouse because my old G700 was showing its age
898	neg	Figured I could use logitech again since they dont make the G700's anymore
898	neg	The two big things are the software and the double click
898	neg	The software is a bit clunky to use and there is no dedicated Push To Talk button
898	neg	The mouse left click after about 6 months of use it now registers a double click which makes some interfacing atrocious
899	pos	Amazing Mouse
899	pos	I’m not a gamer but I design and needed a good comfortable mouse
899	pos	The weights option was awesome
899	pos	It keeps my motion more even
899	pos	My daughter and son who are gamers have them and love them
900	pos	Holy cow this thing is awesome
900	pos	You can make profiles for different games and link them to the game file so when you open it the mouse automatically switches to that games preferences
900	pos	I love this mouse and it's exactly what I wanted
901	pos	Its perfect, perfect weight[because you can adjust, perfect ergonomics
901	pos	Perfect fit, perfext sensitivity, perfect sleek look not too tlashy but still has some futuristic leds, best of all perfect software to detail customize your mouse and the price is under $100, i had a g300s before and it lasts forever logitech makes durable mice
901	pos	Id recommend this to everyone and id buy it again after when i need a new mouse
902	neg	Everyone talks about how there is a double clicking issue
902	neg	I wish my mouse for that far in its week or two life of being used
902	neg	The mouse doesn't even work and I'm not doing puzzles moving the cable every which way to "fix" it
902	neg	Can't really say much else other then the lights are pretty when they worked with the games and maybe spend more in a wireless one
902	neg	Can't suggest Logitech or razor since I'm having issues with both my mice from them (this one was my newest)
903	neg	First, the mouse feels like it is made from cheap plastic
903	neg	very light although the weights help
903	neg	The deal breaker was out of the box 3 buttons were not registering clicks
903	neg	The new Logitech software is unwieldy and hard to use
903	neg	in no way is it intuitive
903	neg	Stick with Razer if you are looking for a mouse Logitech has gone way down hill
904	neg	wouldent work on uplay with breakthrough, my next game is going to be farcry 6 and I think I will just stay with my older mouse and save the frustration
905	pos	This mouse is outstanding
905	pos	The buttons are easily programmable for macroing
905	pos	I carry this mouse daily in a side pocket of a backpack and it gets knocked around a fair amount, it has held up VERY well
905	pos	The size is perfectly ergonomic for an average male hand
906	neg	I got it for the nice scrolling and side scroll buttons
906	neg	The biggest issue with it is that the cursor sometimes slips and throws off my accuracy
906	neg	It was very frustrating when it happens
907	neg	got this mouse because my old mouse's scrollwheel is broken and ive been wanting a new mouse for awhile
907	neg	Its not too bad except for the scroll wheel IT WILL MOVE IF YOU SLIGHTLY JITTER MOUSE
907	neg	It's insane how often ive lost in games thanks to this mouse in an intense firefight i move my mouse but if i move it too fast im suddenly switching weapons
907	neg	That and there is no customization options for this mouse the drivers you get just run it on your computer unlike other gaming mice theres no way to set marco's or custom dpi settings or anything like that
907	neg	Guess ill just buy a 2nd mouse like the one i had before
908	neg	Could have been a great mouse slightly wider and if that uncomfortable sniper button was gone
908	neg	Why place a button where your thumb rests for proper control
908	neg	This needs to be redesigned to mimic the G700 which is no longer sold
909	neg	This is the 2nd one of these I have ordered, and the first ones right-click went out within almost exactly 3 months as well
909	neg	Never had this problem with the G502 none Hero edition, very disappointed in this quality of this mouse
910	pos	I love this mouse, and think it is an amazing mouse
910	pos	the customizable weight set lets you balance it beautifully for a more tailored experience
910	pos	The DPI settings are customizable for all 5 setpoints
910	pos	There is just 1 issue I have with it and it might just be how I hold the mouse
910	pos	Occassionally when I left click on the mouse it triggers the increase DPI mouseclick as well (I might also be hitting the button) so as you can imagine no matter what I'm doing I end up at max DPI settings
911	pos	Don't buy any other mouse
911	pos	Unless you want wireless
911	pos	But hey we want low latency right
911	pos	Seriously I don't know what took me so long to get this mouse
911	pos	It's quiet, responsive, and sleek to boot
911	pos	No problems for gaming or everyday use
911	pos	Worth every penny
912	neg	Bought this mouse last year around June, started having issues with double clicking around 6 months in
912	neg	Issue was not happening often but was noticeable and disappeared for a while
912	neg	Here I am, using the mouse for about 1 year and a month and now its fully double clicking everything all the time
913	pos	Corded mice is the only way to get zero latency
913	pos	Once I organized my mouse cord properly, this thing is a dream
913	pos	It's easy to program, too
914	neg	Came wonky
914	neg	Slightest nudge on usb makes it disconnect
914	neg	Stuck with it because I liked the mouse otherwise and am to busy to deal with returning / researching a replacement
914	neg	After just a few months of moderate use the buttons gave out and I am no longer able to click and drag or even long click
915	pos	I love this mouse for how button-rich it is, for its software, for its build quality, for the 2-mode wheel
915	pos	I just can't get over the fact how narrow it is
915	pos	It is long for big hands, but why so narrow
915	pos	what is my pinky supposed to, should I cut it off
915	pos	Questions, questions
916	pos	While the mouse itself is generally fine, over the past year and a half of using it, the G Hub software (the software required to customize the mouse-button functions) frequently fails to recognize the application being used
916	pos	This had never happened to me when I was using my Razer mouse (which I bought the Logitech to replace it)
916	pos	As a result, I wish I had stuck with the Razer mouse instead
917	pos	Disappointed this didn't work longer
917	pos	Wouldn't drag photos, wouldn't highlight words, crop, etc
917	pos	Frustrating
917	pos	Trying a different brand this time
918	pos	Logitech has really made the ultimate mouse this time
918	pos	I loved my old mouse and still use it for my old system
918	pos	But this one is everything a mouse should be
918	pos	Don't look any further
918	pos	This is as good as it gets
919	neg	The mouse wheel started jumping around after finishing scrolling
919	neg	It is unusable for more than a few minutes as have to try and fine tune and get just right to get a page where you want it on the screen
920	pos	Purchased this to replace my old g502 mouse
920	pos	Only complaint is that the original g502 software that over used for the last 5 years doesnt work for this mouse, it doesnt even detect it's plugged in
920	pos	Had to rummage around through a slightly confusing website & keep trying things until I found one that worked to re-assign my keys to the mouse
921	pos	I was expecting it to feel cheap because logitech
921	pos	but to my surprise it's actually quite nice
921	pos	The materials used to make it do a great job of making it feel premium and the shape mouse fits really well with the resting position of my hand
921	pos	I would give tis mouse a 10 out of 10 for design and comfort
922	pos	I have a larger hand and this has a great feel and doesn’t make my hand cramp up
922	pos	I can set the different buttons to function as needed
922	pos	I am an avid gamer and for the price feel like this is one of the best you can get
922	pos	Looks exactly as shown and works just as described
922	pos	Definitely something I suggest to friends and others looking for a great functioning product
923	pos	What can I say
923	pos	This mouse replaced my cheap 10 dollar wireless mouse
923	pos	World of difference
923	pos	Plenty of customization's an you don't have to go online to get it to work unlike another company I wont mention here
924	pos	I replaced my old G402 mouse with this, and am extremely happy with my purchase so far
924	pos	The mouse comfortably fits my hand, the buttons are easy to reach/use
924	pos	The adjustable weight is a nice touch, as I can weight the mouse to my preference for a heavier feel
924	pos	The RGB can be turned off, which I like
924	pos	16,000 DPI is probably overkill, but it's great to never feel like I need more DPI than the mouse can provide
925	pos	I like almost everything about this mouse
925	pos	The one thing that I dislike is the mousewheel is free rolling, and that one thing makes it a real pain in the backside
926	pos	I had a razer death adder mouse before and bought this as a replacement
926	pos	I am very happy with the mouse
926	pos	It is really high quality
926	pos	Love the design
926	pos	Had a couple of long game seshs and it works perfect
926	pos	The scroll wheel had a lock to let it fly or keep it clicky
926	pos	The weights are easy to adjust
926	pos	This is the coolest mouse ive owned
926	pos	10/10 would recommend
927	pos	Well built
927	pos	I use it for CAD rather than gaming
927	pos	The software is problematic on the Mac
927	pos	I finally had to pair it with Steermouse - a 3rd party driver
927	pos	But the mouse itself is excellent
928	pos	I didn’t think I was going to like this mouse but my boyfriend insisted that weighted mice are just night and day from my current razor mouse
928	pos	I gave it a try and man was he right
928	pos	It’s so smooth and clean and perfect for gaming
928	pos	This will be my mouse until the internet be of time
929	pos	This mouse is great for productivity
929	pos	I’ve assigned the buttons to run macro in my Excel workbooks, and can quickly drill down on accounts and pull Journal Entries without having to use alt keys
929	pos	10/10 would recommend for a home/work office
930	pos	I've used the Logitech G600 for work and this, the G502 for my personal computer as well as several m510's in the past
930	pos	Logitech build quality is consistently great, and this mouse does not disappoint
930	pos	It performs well, the free scroll feature is very satisfying to use on long documents or internet pages, and the logitech software is second to none (having used the corsair iCue as well)
930	pos	The adjustable weight is my favorite part; the mouse feels very well balanced with a little bit of weight
930	pos	If the wireless version weren't so expensive, I would go for that, but this is a perfectly good mouse in terms of features and feel and I highly recommend it
931	pos	Smooth action with precise feel
931	pos	Nice build
931	pos	Good for gaming and for everyday use
931	pos	A HUGE improvement over the commodity mouse I was using
932	neg	Within the first year it started to suffer from the double-click plague
932	neg	Just suddenly starts registering half of single clicks as double clicks
932	neg	Even dragging items because frustrating as it will release the item too soon
932	neg	Tried numerous solutions aside from tearing the thing apart and manually replacing switches
932	neg	Not what I buy a mouse for
932	neg	Not a hard core gamer
932	neg	Mostly an MMO player which puts stress on the keyboard and right mouse
932	neg	Left should not have gone out this quickly
932	neg	Seems pretty rampant with Logitech mice so I will try another brand
933	neg	Mouse worked well for 10 months then the left button started acting up
933	neg	Double clicking and not holding a click
933	neg	When I tried for example outlining text or click and dragging something was all but impossible
933	neg	Its getting to the point of near useless now so I will be returning to Logitech and see how the return policy is
933	neg	I'll edit the review after a replacement
933	neg	I liked it up to this point
934	pos	I haven't used it for much gaming yet but this is an amazing mouse at first glance
934	pos	If there are any problems i shall update this review, but at the moment this is one of the best additions to my set up
935	pos	I purchased this gaming mouse not for myself, but for my boyfriend
935	pos	He loves gaming with his friends and I had no idea which mouse would be good to get him
935	pos	At first he has to get used to the size of the mouse, since he had always head bigger ones -- but once he adjusted he loved it
935	pos	I really wanna get one for myself
935	pos	Unfortunately I can't write a detailed review about what it's like to use/play with, but he did love it for his games (League, Valorant, Apex Legends, Minecraft, Among Us, etc)
936	pos	Only had it for a day, but thus far this is the best mouse I've owned
936	pos	Great for gaming, but also great for just general computing
936	pos	It has a very premium feel to it, and I love the scroll wheel
937	pos	Can't even describe how much of a game changer this was for my everyday use
937	pos	Everything about this mouse has improved my experience on PC
937	pos	I'm glad I got it on sale too
938	pos	After years of daily gaming, my son finally wore out an older version of this mouse, so when he was presented with the replacement, he was thrilled
938	pos	It's pretty much a perfect gaming mouse, a great buy
939	pos	Overall a great mouse with programmable buttons, easy to use software that lets you assign macros
939	pos	If you want the most comfortable mouse for palm grip, Corsair Ironclaw would be a much better choice, but the scroll wheel on the Logitech is surprisingly good
940	pos	Great mouse for gaming
940	pos	Has enough buttons for the commands I need
940	pos	Demands a little bit inventive-ness to properly use with healbot, but can be made to work
941	pos	I bought this mouse about 9 months ago, and for most of that time it worked flawlessly
941	pos	However, after not even a year of use, the right and left click buttons started acting up
941	pos	Now, a short time later, they barely work at all
941	pos	I think this is due to the use of cheap materials used in the button switches
941	pos	Now I have to buy a new mouse
941	pos	During the time that it did work I loved this mouse, but now I definitely would not recommend anyone to buy it, unless you want to buy another one in less than a year
942	pos	I really liked this mouse, and everything about it
942	pos	it feels nice in my hand, which is about 8' and it controls nicely too
942	pos	However, this is a very heavy mouse, and the sliders (skates
942	pos	idk) on the bottom aren't great
942	pos	with the weight and the quality of the skates, making small and precise movements were hard
942	pos	I ended up using this mouse for a month or two and then bought a Glorious model D that I am much more satisfied with
943	neg	I really enjoyed using this mouse
943	neg	The first one I received started having the switch issues about 9mo into ownership
943	neg	Getting a replacement was very fast and straightforward that time
943	neg	The replacement started having the same issues about 6mo later
943	neg	And this time, support takes about a week between responses and makes you jump through hoops like going to 3rd party websites, taking videos of yourself using the mouse, all to try to get you to give up on your case
943	neg	Then at the end, only to be told your replacement is out of stock
943	neg	Save yourself the hassle and get something else
944	neg	I first purchased this product in June/July 2019, and until recently it would have received a solid 4 or 5 stars, but unfortunately the primary left click sensor seems to be dying, as now the mouse will sometimes not register a click at all, or double click, or it will click and then suddenly release without actually letting go, etc
944	neg	A bit disappointing, served me well enough while it worked but my next purchase will likely be an alternative product
945	pos	I've got big hands
945	pos	Using most mice for any significant amount of time becomes uncomfortable
945	pos	This is where this mouse comes in
945	pos	It's large enough and ergonomic enough that I can use it for hours without discomfort
946	pos	It’s been quite accurate and consistent
946	pos	For my hand it’s not ergonomic
946	pos	I can see it being more ergonomic for someone with smaller hands but not for bigger hands
947	pos	Bought as a gift for my son
947	pos	he said it takes a bit of fine tuning the weights ,but, once dialed in
947	pos	he says it is the best mouse he's ever used
948	pos	Great mouse
948	pos	I love the weights; they actually make a difference
948	pos	Plenty of buttons for me (even for Star Citizen)
948	pos	I highly recommend
949	neg	Lasted 5 month and now the left click is miss clicking all the time
949	neg	I can't drag anything because it somehow unclicks the image or item that I'm holding
949	neg	Thought Logitech was a good brand, now a cheap Chinese mouse is comparable to their prodcuts
950	pos	Love the mouse, it’s great for gaming
950	pos	Easy to use and has great response
950	pos	Happy with purchase
950	pos	I would recommend
951	pos	I love the mouse it is great for fps
951	pos	The sensitivity adjustments are perfect, I really did not need to download the software because it was already perfect because i got  everything I needed on the mouse I highly recommend it for gamers that play FPS games
951	pos	I also like the color and rgb on the G letter on the mouse It is a perfect design
952	neg	This use to be the best mosue out there, but holy crap the plastic is so flimsy and the LMB and RMB buttons break within months now compared to back then where they took years to wear out
952	neg	Logitech stopped using good sources for their materials and cut a deal with China instead and now their mice are crap
952	neg	It's a shame because it's an amazing shape for a mouse, comfy, good looking, and hella good for games
952	neg	But they break so damn quick
953	pos	This would be the perfect mouse if it didn't attract dirt like a magnet
953	pos	Constantly having to clean it off
953	pos	Great mouse other than that
953	pos	Love the scroll lock feature
954	neg	The mouse has to use a download the fine tune the operating speed of the mouse, the default is the hight setting
955	pos	Very good for if you grab the entire mouse with your palm
955	pos	My hands are medium/large for a guy
955	pos	I use my fingertips to hold the mouse, though, so it's not the most ergonomic and I find it rather difficult to press any of the extra thumb buttons because of that
955	pos	The software (G HUB) it comes with allows extensive customization and mapping of keys -- including combination of keys -- to almost any buttons
955	pos	A little bit of a resource hog, though, as my mid/low end laptop can attest to
955	pos	I'm glad I bought it despite the fit not being the best for my hand
956	neg	When I opened the box I was just so Disgusted of the product
956	neg	Idk why or how this mouse is supposed to be new got this way but that’s just nasty look at the picture
956	neg	What
956	neg	Didn’t get to test it didn’t even touch it how dirty it was
957	pos	This is a rebuy after running its older brother into the ground with years and years of gaming
957	pos	Comfortable, reliable, has many many configurable buttons, solid and looks like a space ship
957	pos	I love it
958	pos	As someone who needs the ability to have keybinds for games on my mouse, this mouse checked all boxes
958	pos	very ergonomic design, customizable RGB lighting, and plenty of assignable buttons with great placement
958	pos	admittedly somewhat heavy compared to most modern gaming mice, it still pairs well with a hard mouse pad like the G440
958	pos	I recently upgraded to the wireless version which is actually lighter than this one, and I may never buy a new mouse other than a replacement G502 again
959	pos	I use it for CAD, and it's sufficient for this
959	pos	I don't like it as much for gaming because the resolution is still too high at it's lowest setting
959	pos	I also don't like that the door that opens for the installation of the weights is magnetically sealed
959	pos	It sometimes opens up in my backpack and I have to search for it
960	pos	It’s got so many different buttons on it imma have to watch a YouTube video to make sure I’m using all the features this mouse has to offer
961	pos	This is a really solid mouse
961	pos	I used it for a week or 2 and was very happy
961	pos	The big reason I ended up not keeping it was it is very heavy compared to my g pro wireless even without added weights
961	pos	This added weight introduced some strain to my wrist
961	pos	This is very subjective but worth mentioning
962	pos	Being able to toggle the DPI sensitivity on the fly, adjust the mouse 'roller' wheel, and other things were unexpected
962	pos	Overall, very happy with this mouse
963	pos	This has been an absolutely fantastic mouse
963	pos	Pros:- It fits the hand well- Scroll wheel has been my favorite thing, very nice feeling and easy to control- It has extra buttons for gaming or to quickly change the movement speed- It can illuminate in sync with keyboards and all thatCons:- none
964	neg	The scroll wheel stinks
964	neg	Either you let it free wheel where it will register up and down motions if you breath near it
964	neg	Or you have to develop calluses due to the strength needed to make the wheel click
965	pos	On steroids
965	pos	This thing is seriously amazing
965	pos	Very customizable and works like a champ
965	pos	No issues and would highly recommend
966	pos	I like how all the buttons feel and the color changing on the G is a great feature
966	pos	The wheel has 2 different types of scrolls and the smoother one can go a little crazy when you scroll it too fast
966	pos	You can add weights to the mouse as well
966	pos	Altogether a great mouse for the price
967	pos	I was previously using some dinky 5 button mouse that I thought worked well enough but the difference this mouse made was night and day
967	pos	Way too light for me without the weights but I do like the options
967	pos	Will be using this mouse for the foreseeable future
968	pos	I upgraded from a Redragon S101 combo pack mouse to this
968	pos	I definitely think that I did get an upgrade with this mouse
968	pos	I like having the scroll wheel speed toggle, because you don't want a flywheel whilst gaming
968	pos	It does have alot more responsiveness than my old mouse, which should be expected from this kind of mouse
968	pos	I did have some trouble with the Logitech G Hub, but after re-installing it it worked
968	pos	Overall, I would recommend this mouse
969	pos	The adjustable weights give me just the right feel when gaming or just using regularly
969	pos	I like having plenty of macros to work with in games, and this does the job really nicely
969	pos	Syncs with the Logitech G app so I have my mouse function profiles sync with my headphones so they match color
969	pos	Good handling and I like all the customization
970	pos	G502 is the best mouse on the market from the design to feel to hardware
970	pos	Highest DPI I could find
970	pos	I maxed out the dpi, and I low the smoothness
971	neg	Honestly the worst decision I ever made was buying this junk
971	neg	This mouse in no way fits my hand, even when i claw grip it I am finding my self hold the mouse awkwardly and completely wrong for any style gaming
971	neg	If it had an alternate side which allowed me to rest my third finger and grip with my pinky it would be better
971	neg	sensor is definitely better than my roccat but every thing else is just worse
971	neg	even the software is worse than the swarm
971	neg	just sad for a highly recommended mouse
972	neg	As soon as I opened the box I knew I was returning this mouse
972	neg	Quality of the Teflon glide strips is junk
972	neg	I can tell it will be messed up in no time at all
972	neg	One pad was already pulled up in the corner out of the box
972	neg	All but one look thin and cheap
972	neg	Good eurgonamics but I didnt play with it cause I want something that will last
973	neg	Wow, what a God awful product
973	neg	I have bought 3 of these(stupid of me I know) and all of them end up having the right or left click button not be able to be held down
973	neg	Ruining all fps games
973	neg	Piece of junk
973	neg	BUY ANYWHERE ELSE I would call in the warranty but I don't want another piece of junk
973	neg	What a waste of space
973	neg	Zero stars
973	neg	Will never buy Logitech again
974	neg	My husband and I both have this mouse we got them probably a year or more apart and we both started having issues with the left button at the same time
974	neg	We've updated firmware and cleaned out everything and the issues remain
975	pos	Realmente es muy muy buen mouse, aparte de que su precio esta super bien, me ha gustado mucho como rinde tanto para tareas diarias como para juegos y edición de video
975	pos	Es un poco pesado pero esta muy bien
975	pos	Con los 11 botones que tiene no tengo idea a que asignarlos pero son muy útiles sobre todo para copiar, pegar eliminar, etc
975	pos	Otra cosa es el scroll infinito, es muy útil para archivos muy largos
975	pos	Lo que mas me gusta del g502 son los perfiles que puedes crear y configurar en el software de Logitech
976	pos	Ghub is hot garbage
976	pos	I hate it with a passion
976	pos	Might not be so bad for people who only want light customization, but even then It'll give you a headache
976	pos	Again
976	pos	Great mouse, terrible, terrible software
976	pos	Terrible
977	pos	I like the mouse
977	pos	It has a lot of buttons which you can program to do whatever you want through logitech g hub
977	pos	However, it could just be how I’m holding the mouse, the back feels a bit off
977	pos	Then again I have some pretty small hands
977	pos	Either way it’s a good mouse
978	neg	I dont know how this mouse has so many positive reviews
978	neg	Coming from a long time G500 with 3 close knit thumb buttons, the g502 is trash
978	neg	Your palm constantly has to reposition to be able to hit all 3
978	neg	You either sit your palm back to have two accessible thumb buttons or you move to the front side to have access to the front two buttons
978	neg	Also these buttons feel tacky and cheap mostly due to the sharp edge style they went for instead of rounded buttons that dont stick out as much
979	neg	Their is a lot to love about this mouse, the buttons are in just the right place and the scroll wheel i very fun
979	neg	But it broke on me after 2 years
979	neg	The mouse started to have this double click issue, it makes games like Minecraft unplayable because I can’t eat or use my shield
979	neg	Web browser is also a nightmare as I would close or open one tab then delete 2 by mistake
980	pos	I love the extra two buttons to the left of the left click button
980	pos	Those buttons combined with the 3 on the side are more than enough for most of my games hotkeys
980	pos	It is super responsive and the GHub logitech software is super clean and nice to use
981	neg	Received this on the date of of review
981	neg	Tried to give this bad boy a spin and found the right click was unresponsive and the clicking was null
981	neg	I've issued an exchange for a new one to see if that helps
981	neg	The review will change upon me receiving a new version
981	neg	As of now though, I wouldn't purchase this one
982	neg	None of the advertised features (customizable DPI, colors, etc) work unless you install Logitech's "G HUB" software
982	neg	And that software is extremely buggy
982	neg	Mine gets stuck in the loading screen unless I uninstall, reinstall the software + mouse drivers
982	neg	and if I ever restart my computer, it is stuck again
982	neg	If you close the software, all your mouse settings immediately become disabled
982	neg	I contacted Logitech's support, and they provided one solution that didn't work
982	neg	I am never buying Logitech peripherals again
983	pos	The mouse is great on all counts, but I like the custom weigh system
983	pos	Some mice feel cheap and too light
983	pos	You can add or remove weights in the bottom for the perfect feel and movement
984	pos	"lowest" DPI setting still isn't low enough
984	pos	The quality of the components is better than most mice, and the sensor is excellent
984	pos	But, even at the lowest setting the mouse moves too fast
985	pos	This is one of my favorite mice's to play games in the computer
985	pos	Very ergonomic, materials are really good quality and the usability it just feel natural
985	pos	Love it
985	pos	Got it also with a nice discount
986	neg	err done broke
986	neg	wont register the right and left scroll wheel clicks
986	neg	I have redownloaded the software, undid the binds
986	neg	Nothing is fixing it
986	neg	I dont even think i have had this mouse for two months yet and i dont even use it full time
986	neg	I switch between it and my Razer Basilisk
987	pos	I have been using this model of mouse for years
987	pos	Work and Gaming
987	pos	Superb
987	pos	My son whom is a competition gamer uses this mouse and loves it
987	pos	Need I say more
987	pos	okay I will
987	pos	Built like a tank and works like one the finest luxury rides you can get on the market
987	pos	You will not go wrong with this Logitech gear
988	pos	fast mouse - the micro program i cant get it to save to the mouse  memory profile to take to another pc - but it will work on the pc you program it too -as default
989	pos	its a good mouse but I don't think there is a way to turn the light off without unplugging the mouse (maybe there is and I just haven't found it) but once you get used to it the mouse is easy to use
990	pos	Great mouse fits like a glove
990	pos	high quality, not as heavy as expected
991	pos	i have always been a fan of logitech mouse, the gaming mouse continues that with its value and workmanship
992	pos	The mouse without weights is already a bit heavier than most, but it doesnt feel like I'm gonna break it like I did with the G pro, very comfortable for long gaming sessions and the Ghub makes it simple to set different keyboards for a solid amount of major titles
993	pos	Can't say I use it for gaming much since I still use controller but it looks cool and feels much better than a regular mouse
993	pos	Very comfortable and doesn't break the bank
994	pos	This is a massive upgrade from the gaming mouse I just had
994	pos	The software is better, but I will say that it is slightly small for my hand
994	pos	Slightly
994	pos	The customization for the buttons is incredible and I really enjoy that I was able to add all the weights to give it some heft
994	pos	As with all things, I would recommend trying this guy out before committing
995	pos	The level of frustration hase increased to epic levels after several months of use
995	pos	The right mouse button issue you read about is real and will give you nightmares
996	pos	If you don't use the macro settings for hotkeys, this is the one you want
996	pos	If you're looking to set up hotkey macros, get the expensive one
997	pos	I have been using this mouse for a day and I have noticed that this mouse is great, however this mouse has one flaw which would be the feature of the scoll wheel
997	pos	It was creative but this mouse has a feature which makes it very loose and makes the scroll wheel go on for mutiple lines and i know theres an option for that but when you press the button on the bottom of the scroll wheel to make the scroll wheel go stiff and maybe a little to stiff for my personal liking Other than that this gaming mouse is the best you could find at this price
998	pos	Its a great mouse for gaming or viewing large documents
998	pos	The scroll release is practical for large documents, I jave not been able to get use to it during gaming
999	pos	First off the mouse is pretty damn cool
999	pos	It fits perfectly in the palm of my hand
999	pos	It comes with weights for better traction and precision
999	pos	The only thing I noticed was the left clicker feels as though it could break easly break, so I'll take extra care of it
999	pos	Overall a great buy for the price
1000	pos	As someone who is new to OC gaming, this mouse is perfect
1000	pos	The buttons allow for a wide variety of button mapping and are in comfortable positions
1000	pos	The weights just are the icing on the cake
1000	pos	The wire also is slack so it doesn't get in the way
1000	pos	Love the sounds of the buttons and the overall feel of the mouse
1000	pos	Very good purchase
1001	pos	Good:- Works perfect on mac and PC- Excellent Logitech software- Feels nice in your hands (even for people with big hands like me)- So many buttons
1001	pos	all customizable
1001	pos	- Looks awesomeBad:- Not a deal breaker, but I do wish it rested a little bit higher so it would go into your palm
1002	pos	I dont care about all the bells and whistles, just tired of buying cheap mice that crap out after a year and this is still working
1003	pos	Maybe I was expecting more, but too many buttons in just the wrong place for my large thumbs
1003	pos	Just not for me
1004	pos	I've had this game mouse for over a year and it has work really well, I am still happy with it and it has work well for the most part
1004	pos	Just for context I use it everyday and well so far it has been a great product, and my favorite gaming mouse
1004	pos	10/10 in aesthetics indeed, it gives me futuristic vibes
1005	pos	Comfortable for both gaming and working from home, too
1005	pos	Is a good size (fits the shape/curve of my right hand nicely) and comes with weights to adjust to your comfort
1005	pos	I've had no issues so far
1005	pos	I bought this after my long-time favorite mouse broke (a pretty old discontinued Logitech Performance MX Wireless mouse) and am happy with this choice of replacement
1005	pos	I am hoping this one will last as long as my previous Logitech mouse
1006	pos	The additional weights were a plus, otherwise the mouse is too light IMO
1006	pos	The mouse wheel felt clunky and the position required me to use my index verses middle finger
1006	pos	The angle of the mouse was too flat, I would have preferred the left side to be about
1006	pos	5 inch higher than the right
1006	pos	The mouse shell is too flat for my hands
1006	pos	I may pass this off to one of my grandkids as it would fit their hands better or keep it for a spare
1007	pos	The mouse is great, its has a nice quality feel, the RGB is nice, and the sensor is amazing but on my mouse there was a personal issue with the mouse skate
1007	pos	When I first slid it on my mouse pad it started to scratch it and it didn't have a smooth glide
1007	pos	So I turned the mouse around and noticed the mouse skate was not positioned right on the bottom, so I tried repositioning it but then the mouse skate wouldn't stick back on to the mouse
1007	pos	That is the only main issue with my personal mouse but everything else is great
1008	neg	Dowloaded the app and unchecked roughly 17 boxes to stop the giant glowing logo on the mouse, but as soon as I close my PC the thing lights up my room like the fourth of July
1008	neg	Not sure why it's so important to have the giant glowing logo, but this mouse sells itself on customizability and won't even let you turn off this feature
1009	pos	This new version comes with color changing lights and the range of adjustibility for sensitivity is much bigger, all else is nearly identical to previous versions
1010	neg	I bought this device Apr 17, 2020 and by Sep 1, 2020
1010	neg	Five months later my right mouse button has begun dying
1010	neg	I don't think Logitech is at fault because I've owned other models and they lasted years but I will not replace this mouse with the same model
1010	neg	It would have got one star but it has been very comfortable and worked well until it didn't
1011	neg	Mouse worked great for a while
1011	neg	After 6 months mouse now double clicks on single clicks and also won't stay depressed
1011	neg	Extremely frustrating
1011	neg	Logitech very slow to respond
1011	neg	Known issue
1012	neg	I tried ordering two of these wired mice (SE and regular) to have both already been opened and used as they were missing protective stickers on the pads
1012	neg	The first box was opened and had items out of place and jammed back in
1012	neg	Second one did not have any plastic film and there is wear on the friction pads and fingerprints even before I handled it
1012	neg	The buttons are good and mouse is a little small for larger hands
1012	neg	G-Hub is great
1012	neg	Fingerprint resistance would be nice since I was able to see the person's who handled my mouse prior
1013	pos	The sensitivity and ergonomics on this mouse are great
1013	pos	The number of buttons is significant and are arranged in an manner that is not intrusive
1013	pos	I have minor concerns about the quality
1013	pos	The "G" light stopped working (which I determined to be a hardware issue) and the cover for the weights comes off quite easily
1014	pos	very smooth, operation
1014	pos	Worked immediately as soon as I plugged it into my PC
1014	pos	Feels plasticy, but its a $40 mouse
1014	pos	Working great so far
1015	neg	the left button started to get stuck sometimes while using it
1016	neg	I've had this mouse for 7+ months
1016	neg	Starting at around 5 months of use, the left and right mouse buttons started giving me issues
1016	neg	I cannot click and drag without the button registering multiple clicks
1016	neg	This makes it especially difficult during FPS games because trying to aim down the sights and look around results in an irritating and game-ruining "aim down sights dance"
1016	neg	Logitech's customer support has proven to be terrible and unresponsive
1016	neg	Even though I love this mouse, I will probably be trying out a Razer Death Adder because I can't rely on this mouse to work properly
1017	neg	Buyer beware if you use a mouse in free scroll mode, stay away
1017	neg	The mouse wheel is unbalanced and will scroll on its own depending on the direction you move the wheel
1017	neg	mouse is great otherwise, in fixed mode the mouse "bumps" are very pronounced and loud
1017	neg	The mouse has potential however the mouse wheel is something left to be desired
1018	pos	I had been using the GSkill mouse but they are all out, so I went and bought this, I am glad I did, the software is far far superior and easier on resources
1018	pos	Very fun mouse to use
1019	neg	Great mouse overall
1019	neg	I absolutely loved the scroll wheel lock and the thumb rest for I have big hands
1019	neg	A couple months after I bought both left and right click started to double click, not register clicks, and have delayed clicks
1019	neg	I’d find it okay if just mine did this, but as I bought the mouse, I recommended it to 2 of my friends
1019	neg	Sure enough, within two months of them using it, the EXACT same thing happened to their unit
1019	neg	If you’re an avid gamer, please heed my warning and DO NOT BUY THIS
1020	pos	Wasn't a great fit for my hand
1020	pos	I have very large hands and this mouse is quite narrow with almost no hump for palm grip
1020	pos	The very solid mouse wheel also makes it a bit forward balanced which was hard to get used to
1021	neg	Left mouse button wore out after a month, multiple clicks after every click
1021	neg	Still working with logitech for warranty replacement but I'm not happy
1021	neg	I'm writing this review to prevent others from making my mistake, this is hardware issue that has caused me many headaches
1022	pos	I LOVE this mouse it is great for gaming
1022	pos	First: It has RGB like if you don't have RGB on your mouse WHAT ARE YOU DOING
1022	pos	Two: Very good feel
1022	pos	This mouse has a very amazing feel that fits perfectly with your hand
1022	pos	It also has a thumb rest
1022	pos	Three: Program
1022	pos	this mouse comes with a program that is called Logitech G Hub you can change your DPI with your programable buttons and even create personalized DPI settings and you can lower the brightness of your mouse light and make the lights go by faster
1023	neg	Shortest lived mouse I've owned
1023	neg	Accurate
1023	neg	Sure
1023	neg	Comfortable, size wise
1023	neg	Sure
1023	neg	Comfortable, weight wise
1023	neg	A little light but fine
1023	neg	The big issue: just under four months of use and the left mouse started malfunctioning
1024	pos	The USB connector was weak and after treating this mouse like a baby never letting it take damage what eventually broke wasn’t the mouse but the USB connector
1024	pos	It didn’t register as a mouse on my device anymore nor any other devices
1024	pos	The software (GHub) out of all companies is pretty good though and the grip and ergonomics of that mouse was the best I’ve ever had
1024	pos	If i wasn’t so paranoid about the weak USB connector I would’ve gotten it again
1025	pos	This is a fantastic mouse
1025	pos	The price is reasonable
1025	pos	It comes with weights to adjust the mass of the mouse to your liking
1025	pos	This provides a great ergonomic feel with with flow of the mouse it's natural in the hand
1025	pos	The adjustable dip setting is nice for swit hing between different game types which make this great for gaming
1025	pos	The overall construction of the mous is really nice
1026	pos	As a dota and CS player, it is very critical to get a good mouse and this one is one of the top choices in thee market
1026	pos	The best part of it is the ergonomic desigh, which makes your hand feels like a breeze when playing games
1027	pos	I upgraded from a razor black adder and I wasn’t expecting such an improvement
1027	pos	Moving from a palm mouse to a finger mouse has really helped my aiming/flicks in RB6 and apex
1027	pos	The weights that come with it allow you to adjust the weight to your preference
1027	pos	The DPi range also allows you to find a setting that fits you
1027	pos	Overall construction of the mouse is solid and I haven’t had any issues with it so far
1027	pos	Software is good and allows you to change the DPI and custom map buttons
1028	pos	Compré este mouse porqué mis amigos me decían que un mouse de alta gama me haría jugar mejor, la verdad es que si y no, la verdad se siente un cambio abismal, de un mouse gamer genérico a un mouse de gama alta absolutamente te va a cambiar todo el DPI y te llevará semanas a acostumbrarte y cambiar a nuevas sensibilidades en los juegos, todavía sigo buscando configuraciones pero no me arrepiento de la compra, excelente mouse
1029	pos	LOVE this mouse, but it's a little narrow (Hand cramping after long sessions), and HORRIBLE thumb button
1029	pos	The cramping is all me -- I am just a fat handed moronic gamer
1029	pos	The Thumb button is so close to the edge of your thumb you will find yourself pressing by accident in heated FPS battles and wow sessions
1029	pos	Other than the listed above gripes, this mouse is legend
1029	pos	I LOVE Logitech
1030	pos	I made a switch to logitech G series coming from Razer and right from the start I can feel a better sense of quality
1030	pos	I love razer and used their projects for the majority of my PC life, but this mouse surely delivers
1030	pos	I can go on about the specs that are already posted on the listing, but this mouse is a definite 10/10
1031	pos	Very comfortable
1031	pos	Has 5 extra buttons which are great to program as Alt + and Ctrl + buttons
1031	pos	Fits hand comfortably, able to adjust the weight of it and can run multiple settings for speed with a touch of a button
1031	pos	Feels better in my hand than a Naga mouse
1031	pos	I own two, one for my laptop and one for my desktop
1032	neg	Doesn't track properly on all mousepads, I have to rely on the wood grain of my desk
1032	neg	Never had this issue with another mouse
1032	neg	Updating to remove another star
1032	neg	Mouse tracker is absolutely awful
1032	neg	I shouldn't have to keep buying and trying out different options to get the mouse to stop jumping around
1032	neg	I wound up having to tape a sheet of paper to a mousepad, which apart from being an eyesore, tears and has very high friction
1032	neg	Don't understand how Logitech gets away with this
1033	neg	At first I thought it might have been because someone might have spilt something on the mouse
1033	neg	But after cleaning the button itself and the switches, its still sticking (not to mention it looked spotless inside)
1033	neg	I bought this back in October and its already broken
1034	pos	I was so hesitant to upgrade from my Logitech G9X, but this mouse feels almost exactly the same
1034	pos	Finger tip grip
1034	pos	Larger hands (6' 2" user)Cons:I hate the fact that the software always has to run
1034	pos	If you do not want more bloatware, then avoid this mouse
1035	pos	I like the overall feel of the mouse
1035	pos	Some of the button positions could be in a better place, but I have large hands so someone with average hands shouldn't have this problem
1036	pos	So I had to do a lot of repetitive entries, and I just programmed the buttons
1036	pos	Easy as pie
1036	pos	This is maki g the dull tasks fun and super easy
1036	pos	No more typing
1036	pos	Awesome mouse, love it
1036	pos	Sorry
1036	pos	I’m not a gamer, so I can’t get you that feedback, but it’s fully programmable with selective profiles, very flexible
1037	pos	Works great love the new software, this replaced my beloved g700s whose switches are starting to go :(I am very happy with
1038	pos	I loved how everything worked but the instructions didn't give much info about which programs you need to download, you need to get a separate on board memory programer on their website but it's amazing for gaming and has more features then expected
1038	pos	Would recommend
1039	neg	My old G500S gave out after many years of use ( the left click got to where it would release constantly making it impossible to click-hold/drag)
1039	neg	So I bought a this G502 and just a few weeks after the return window  closed the left button started doing the same thing , it just randomly releases and grabs and releases and grabs
1039	neg	rendering the mouse useless
1040	neg	I have an older G502 (not hero) mouse and thought the 502 Hero would be a great mouse to have at work for consistency
1040	neg	However this mouse out of the box was broken
1040	neg	I tried it on multiple computers and the cursor randomly jumps around the screen making it hard to click on anything
1040	neg	I tried resetting default settings and nothing works
1040	neg	I would advise against getting this mouse
1040	neg	What is the point of having it if you can't use it to click on items on your monitors, guess this is going in the trash
1041	pos	Been using it about 3 months and it’s been great so far
1041	pos	I’ve been using it for light work but will be gaming with it here in the next few days
1041	pos	And will update the review but so far I haven’t had any problems and it always works when it’s supposed to
1041	pos	I hear of others having double click problems but I havent had that(yet)
1042	pos	Cannot use this mouse on a cloth mouse pad
1042	pos	It just won't work
1042	pos	I thought the mouse was defective until I tried a hard black surface
1042	pos	The corsair mouse pad
1042	pos	Worked well after that
1042	pos	Software isn't very smart
1042	pos	Not very intuitive and works most of the time
1043	pos	This is my second mouse
1043	pos	The smooth bottom, the adjustable weights, and the multiple dpi profiles makes this mouse perfect for just about anyone
1043	pos	Love it
1044	pos	My first one hasn't broken and it's been a couple of years
1044	pos	Saw it on sale for cyber monday and bought another, just in case
1044	pos	It's that good
1044	pos	Bit of a pain to clean, but besides that it's perfect
1045	pos	Let me start by saying that this mouse is great as far as performance goes
1045	pos	It’s definitely one of my favorite mice to use for FPS
1045	pos	I’ve been using it for a good 5 months now and I’m happy with it
1045	pos	Now I will say that the feel of the mouse is good, but my hands are a bit on the smaller size and it took me a while to get used to
1045	pos	As far as comfort, I’d put this 2nd behind my G403 prodigy (I love that mouse with all my heart) but I needed a replacement and this lived up to most of my expectations
1046	neg	Needs replaced after 6 months of use
1047	pos	After reading other reviews, first thing I did was swapped out the switches
1047	pos	Since I'm bad at removing solder, it took me like 3 hours to get it done
1048	neg	One of the bottom pads began to peel off from normal use and routinely causes my mouse to stick
1048	neg	I use a good quality mousepad too so there should be no reason for this to have happened
1049	pos	Amazing quality made, works amazing for the gamer, perfect response time
1049	pos	finally a mouse without lagging
1049	pos	Very easy to use, an great for all hand sizes
1050	neg	Worked very well for me for a few months, then doubleclick issues started, didn't notice at first but the longer i owned it the worse it became, no doubt within a few months of use you will most likely start experiencing issues as well, i've owned a cheap reddragon mouse for years with no issues, and i was very happy with my purchase at first but mice should definitely be usable for years with no issues
1050	neg	Do not buy unless u want to replace it within a year
1051	pos	I did some research before choosing this product
1051	pos	It's a claw-shaped mouse with everything I really want
1051	pos	It's somewhat narrow for a claw mouse, but it has a comfortable arch
1051	pos	The buttons feel good so far
1051	pos	The scroll wheel is horrible
1051	pos	It free spins
1051	pos	It will even spin if I pick up the mouse
1051	pos	I've actually had to go to individual applications to change my settings to dampen the impact
1051	pos	It's not enough for me to warrant returning it and choosing a different product, but it's really horrible
1052	neg	Garbage
1052	neg	We tried to be patient and understanding, so we returned it and tried again
1052	neg	We're on our 3rd one now and the left click, once again, stopped working consistently
1052	neg	Not good if your using it for gaming
1052	neg	Of course this time it was one week out of the return window
1052	neg	:-/
1053	pos	I have had many Logitech mouses over the years and this one doesn't disappoint
1053	pos	It has held up very well and this is my second time buying it
1054	pos	This mouse is HUGELY worth getting especially for it's price
1054	pos	I don't personally use the extra buttons but I use them for skipping/stopping/resuming songs and with the driver its great for rgb control and it's very durable you can use the weights if you want and its great for gaming no jitter no nothing
1055	neg	This mouse worked great, unfortunately after just under a year the middle scroll button is faulty
1055	neg	It will constantly act like it's being held down, even though it's not, causing me to endlessly scroll on pages when I'm not wanting to
1055	neg	It surprisingly makes using the computer rather difficult and annoying
1055	neg	I have to click the middle scroll button just to unstick it
1056	neg	The switches on these mice are faulty and only work for a little while
1056	neg	For an 80 dollar mouse, I'd expect more than ten cent switches that render the mouse useless
1056	neg	It's a shame, too, because I love this mouse and especially its relatively unique free-scroll feature, the thought of which upsets me because I know I'll have to get used to a different mouse
1056	neg	If I didn't have to choose between spending another 80 bucks or becoming an electrician to solve this issue, I'd give this mouse 5 stars
1057	pos	This mouse has an issue with connecting to the Logitech Gaming Software
1057	pos	No matter how many times I reinstall the software, restart my computer or change the usb slot the mouse is plugged into, it still won’t show up in the menu continuously
1057	pos	Reinstalling the software works until I power the computer off and then back on; it immediately doesn’t show then, and I have to reinstall it all over again
1058	pos	Currently my mouse for everything cord is plenty long to never get in the way and always have enough came with weights if you like the feel of a heavier mouse and has an awesome dpi setting that is perfect
1059	pos	I replaced my G700s with this mouse, they stopped selling the G700
1059	pos	Had issues with the speed buttons until I disabled them and now the left main button is intermittent, 7 months
1060	pos	Really great polling rate, so very responsive
1060	pos	Slight annoyance when you're moving the mouse and the DPI randomly changes (for whatever reason, maybe I'm clicking the DPI button, maybe it's internal/mouse driver), but it's very annoying
1060	pos	Mouse itself feels solidly built, and you can change the weights fairly easily
1061	pos	I love this mouse
1061	pos	The weight is customizable and it moves so smoothly
1061	pos	The scroll wheel can free spin or be controlled at the press of a button
1061	pos	10/10
1062	neg	Logitech quality control has gone downhill lately
1062	neg	The scroll wheel broke when the mouse fell from my desk onto a carpeted floor, a 2' drop
1063	pos	Used daily for a year, gaming and work
1063	pos	Works great
1063	pos	Im used to logitechs  occasionally  buggy software and it isn't that bad really
1063	pos	Works on xbox and pc no problem
1063	pos	Set up dpi on pc, move to xbox and it keeps
1063	pos	Both came in good clean packaging
1063	pos	Will update if any issues
1064	neg	Upgraded from an MX510 I purchased in 2004
1064	neg	Yes, 2004
1064	neg	Pros: Great interface/software for colors and profiles
1064	neg	Very user-friendly
1064	neg	Cons: After 8 months of use, the Left Mouse Clicker registers 75% of the time
1064	neg	This is crucial when gaming
1064	neg	I switched back to my trusty MX510 until I find a replacement
1064	neg	Back on the hunt
1064	neg	I've wasted my money, these Logitech mice are not built like high end models
1065	pos	Cat says it's great and it's the best one it used in his life
1065	pos	Cat is me dad btw XD
1066	pos	They come with custom weight, but I don't use them
1066	pos	I prefer as little weight as possible for fastest swipes
1067	pos	As a console player transitioning to pc gaming this mouse really helped
1067	pos	Struggling with the left hand and WASD movement made any other commands with that hand even more difficult
1067	pos	I have the mouse setup for pretty well every command needed in FPS games except movement
1067	pos	The buttons are well placed and smooth/consistent to operate
1067	pos	Highly recommend this product
1068	pos	This is probably THE BEST gaming mouse for people with a budget
1068	pos	The fast response time is amazing and it feels great
1068	pos	I’ve been using it for some time and it’s probably one of the best mice that I’ve used, idk why I haven’t bought it sooner
1068	pos	It’s a little bit bigger and slightly heavier than normal
1068	pos	But it’ll be quite easy to get used to
1068	pos	10/10 recommend this mouse to other gamers
1069	pos	I had to replace my wireless one due to my buttons being so sensitive no matter how I changed the settings
1069	pos	It is a big rascal which suits me well and my bear paw hands
1070	neg	I don't think I'll ever buy another Logitech mouse ever again
1070	neg	Double-click issue makes it a hassle to do anything, whether it's holding down a mouse button while gaming or trying to highlight part of a document
1070	neg	From what I've heard, they use the trash-quality omron Chinese switches that are prone to this issue
1071	pos	Very comfortable mouse, fitd my hand well
1071	pos	I did not need to use the weights
1071	pos	The mouse is Smooth and very easy to setup
1071	pos	I would recommend is mouse for gaming or computer use
1072	pos	I'm not a fan of RGB unicorn puke builds but I made an exception with this mouse
1072	pos	I was just thinking to myself how nice it is to have different RGB color schemes that indicate certain gaming profiles
1073	pos	I like a heavy mouse with a thumb rest…with 26000dpi this thing even at it’s heaviest is plenty fast for FPS Esports
1073	pos	If you like a beefier mouse for larger hands this is definitely a great option for a fantastic price
1074	pos	Really good for the discounted price
1074	pos	I personally prefer to use the weights, though I know the current trend is to go light
1074	pos	The scroll wheel is cool and effective with it's ability to spin freely if given a flick
1075	neg	The mouse sensor is probably the only good thing here
1075	neg	Each time you do a swift flick or movement, you can hear this noise since the scroll wheel is highly sensitive
1075	neg	The scroll wheel is okay, dont know why they added that infinite scroll mechanic but its okay for the most part
1075	neg	Since I have sausage fingers, I keep hitting the side button, which is highly annoying
1075	neg	The shape of it is meh
1075	neg	Overall, meh
1076	pos	I wish I would have purchased one of these sooner
1076	pos	Definitely an upgrade to the old laser mouse I had which was top of the line back in the day
1076	pos	I'm impressed by it's accuracy
1077	pos	Decent mouse but the buttons are a bit flimsy, left click started double clicking after only a month or so
1077	pos	Set it aside and forgot to return it
1077	pos	Hopefully I can still RMA it
1077	pos	Consider other similar mice with better button design before opting for this one
1077	pos	Disappointing, Logitech used to be the go-to mice for me
1077	pos	One G9 sensor died after 24 hours, the replacement wasn't smooth and failed 6 months later
1077	pos	Then the issue with this mouse
1077	pos	Don't think I'll be buying from them again any time soon
1078	neg	Great mouse for chill gaming, lightweight with optional weights to adjust
1078	neg	One issue that unfortunately makes this mouse impossible to play competitive games reliably is holding the right click button will "disconnect" intermittently
1078	neg	Imagine playing COD or Counterstrike and the screen wont "turn"
1078	neg	UGH
1078	neg	I've attached an image to help illustrate this issue (MS Paint, right button)
1078	neg	Circled are the instances where the mouse doesn't register being "clicked"
1078	neg	Wish I could try again same model, maybe I just got a bum mouse
1079	neg	I looked up the issue of double clicking for this mouse
1079	neg	While it's nice while it works, the damn thing has a lifetime of about 3 months at most before it becomes unusable
1079	neg	Logitech should be ashamed to sell something so defective
1080	pos	Best peice to my gaming setup
1080	pos	This mouse has plenty of hotkeys and very customizable led
1080	pos	Plus it has weights for a feel that you really want
1080	pos	When they say this is the number one gaming mouse they mean it
1081	pos	so far so good, tracks well, handles ok
1081	pos	Unbound the "sniper" thumb button because It gets pressed occasionally when I claw grip
1081	pos	Mouse doesn't creak when I grip it which is nice but I think I've caught the scroll wheel misfiring or double inputting on occasion
1082	pos	I did not like the scroll wheel, it feels slippery
1082	pos	I don't know if this is a defective mouse
1082	pos	I'm returning it
1083	pos	I have big hands and this one feels good
1083	pos	I wish it was a bit bigger but this is one of the bigger gaming mice on the market
1083	pos	I haven’t experienced the double click issue at the time of this review but I’ve owned for for only a month so we will see
1084	pos	This product is great, but there are simply better options
1084	pos	The materials seem very nice, but when you hold the mouse itself, the materials just feel clunky
1084	pos	Even without all the included weights, it is still weighs in at around 100 grams
1084	pos	In addition, I also prefer wireless mice for the reason of convenience
1084	pos	My computer's USB port is kind of strange and doesn't always work, so Bluetooth was the way to go
1084	pos	Overall a ⭐⭐⭐
1085	pos	I bought this to be my main mouse
1085	pos	It is very adjustable in both weight, colors, and sensitivity
1085	pos	I've yet to see the double right click issue
1085	pos	I like that you can make your own profiles for whatever you need it
1085	pos	I've made my thumb buttons adjust volume and my mouse wheel side buttons set to forward and back on a page
1085	pos	The unlocked scroll wheel changed my life
1085	pos	While the mouse is adjustable for weight, the base weight may be too high for some people but I have no issue with it
1086	pos	Bought this as a gift for my brother, I’ve had my own Hero mouse for around 2 years
1086	pos	Best investment I’ve made
1086	pos	I’ve had ZERO problems with this mouse
1086	pos	I game on my pc and this thing is a beast
1086	pos	My only regret is not putting down the extra money for the wireless feature
1086	pos	Nothing wrong at all with the wired version but I’d like to try out that wireless mouse considering how nice this one is
1087	pos	I had been using razer peripherals for a while but I prefer this Logitech mouse
1087	pos	It does t have as many buttons as some other mice but the dpi switch actually works, and I think you can retool the incremental dpi buttons to perform other actions
1087	pos	Weights are nice, very simple to implement
1087	pos	I never thought I’d need or like the option to freewheel the mouse wheel but it’s actually one of my favorite features, now
1088	pos	I was looking for a gaming mouse with additional buttons that I can hotkey
1088	pos	I really enjoy this mouse, it does everything I want it to do, very ergonomic, won't break the bank, the lighting features are cool, but I'm on my second mouse because the first one only lasted seven months before the clicking wasn't registering properly
1089	pos	I had stopped buying Logitech mice as I had mediocre experiences with their mice in the 2000's, but this one is really quite a quality product
1089	pos	It is definitely more precise and feels better to use than the low cost brands
1090	neg	Spend 2 hours trying to make SetPoint recognize this G502 mouse, then checked online "logitech setpoint does not recognize mouse", and found out it is wide spread problem
1090	neg	anyways, no logi products for me anymore
1090	neg	I like my old G5, but I guess logi does not make solid products anymore
1091	neg	mouse feels awesome in the hand, it was obviously used when it was shipped to me
1091	neg	There were no weights in the plastic bag it came in, and the gliders already had crud in them
1091	neg	The mouse though is fantastic, works well with the rest of my Logitech equipment
1092	pos	Good mouse with programable buttons
1092	pos	However, you do have to use their software to program some of the buttons which is a bit clunky but usable
1093	pos	I play alot of games and require quick accurate equipment this works wonderfully
1093	pos	The mouse 🐁 has been very good at sensing small movements
1094	pos	Got this for my son for gaming, and he uses it all the time
1094	pos	Great product and value
1095	pos	I got this mouse for gaming and it has worked great
1095	pos	the mouse has great ergonomics great sensor and the buttons feel superbthe scroll wheel has two options no resistance or resistance and if you use x mouse button control and set if to left click LOL
1095	pos	the software great if you learn how to use itbuttons 4

1095	pos	5 stars
1096	neg	I was so excited when I ordered this mouse
1096	neg	I saw so many reviews
1096	neg	Everyone talks about how many buttons it has and how good the mouse is but what no one tells you is that 3 out of the total buttons are only for dps
1096	neg	They can't be remapped
1096	neg	They are totally useless
1096	neg	Just sitting there right next to the left click button
1096	neg	Even the software doesn't have an option to remap these 3 useless buttons
1096	neg	Total disappointment
1096	neg	I wish I ordered some other mouse
1096	neg	I packed the mouse back in the box
1096	neg	It's sitting in my cupboard now along with other useless products
1097	pos	I have had it for a few months and it is holding up so far
1097	pos	It is pretty responsive
1097	pos	Hopefully it will last a long time
1098	neg	Like others have said before: whilst the mouse may be comfortable and works for a couple of months, I noticed while playing online matches that holding down the left click would no longer work
1098	neg	Any game that relied on me needing to hold it down only ended in frustration and apparently this is a known issue with an internal component
1098	neg	You can click regularly but anything longer than a second is pointless
1098	neg	If I was only needing to do simple web searches this wouldn't be a problem but considering I bought it for gaming =/
1099	pos	Plugged it in & it just worked
1099	pos	Had to download software from logitech, but that was easy to do
1099	pos	The logitech software makes it super easy to customize the buttons, and the extra weights are perfect
1099	pos	Also the dual mode scroll wheel wasn't something I knew I needed, but now I love it
1100	neg	Ordered a new logitech mouse, received a used one
1100	neg	I saw another review who had the same issue
1100	neg	Seems like TechNoLogic is trying this trick on a regular basis
1100	neg	This review is NOT for the product, but for the TechNoLogic storefront, if anything, Logitech should be concerned that their product is receiving bad reviews due to a shady seller
1101	pos	I don’t really have much experience with gaming mouses prior to this purchase
1101	pos	All I can say is that I love it
1101	pos	Logitech G-hub allows for nearly full customization of all mouse features
1101	pos	DPI settings can be customized and shifted to by the click of one of the mouse buttons
1101	pos	Colors can be customized as well
1102	neg	First mouse I received was defective right out of the box, had a free-rolling scroll wheel as other buyers have experienced
1102	neg	The second mouse I received worked for a day, then the scroll wheel had the same issue
1102	neg	The exchange service was extremely fast but unfortunately the product just isn't going to work
1102	neg	Gonna have to find another mouse
1103	pos	PROS:-Really good for the price-9 customizable buttons-RGB-Exceptional sensor-Amazing wheel-Very confortable-Really usefull software-Adjustable weights-Easy acces to change profiles and dpi (only 1 click)-Infinite scroll wheelCONS:-Not really a con but I think they should've add rgb around the mouse or more rgb in general
1103	pos	Once you have it it seems to be a little rgb in the mouse
1104	pos	Love the scroll button lock and unlock feature
1104	pos	definitely  helpful
1104	pos	also comes with weights to install into the mouse
1104	pos	in case the mouse is too light feeling
1104	pos	Best mouse I've had in a long time
1105	pos	The mouse is a big upgrade for me and whether i'm destroying small children in Warzone or grown men in Tarkov i can trust that my mouse will allow me to dispatch my foes at the optimal rate
1105	pos	For real though, having the ability to switch dpi mid game or between games without having to open the settings is a massive plus and the software is super easy to use for the price the mouse is an easy cop for someone looking to either upgrade or try something new
1106	pos	I'm a big dude, and my hands fit comfortably around this mouse
1106	pos	I also like some heft to my mice, and with the hot swappable weights you can put in the bottom of the mouse, it makes getting those precise headshots in FPS's when you find the right weight for you
1107	pos	High accuracy and love the customs option for all the buttons
1107	pos	Im a graphic designer and also a PC gamer, have configuration of the buttons for each thing
1108	neg	This mouse is rated to a million clicks
1108	neg	I purchased it in September of 2019
1108	neg	I didn't get anywhere near that many clicks before the left click button started double clicking when being pressed once
1108	neg	This is very frustrating
1108	neg	I would expect better from a mouse at this price
1108	neg	I'm not going to purchase any logitech products in the future, nor would I recommend them to anyone else
1109	neg	I've always liked Logitech products for their durability, and this one was great at first
1109	neg	But after a year of heavy use, the left click has stopped working
1109	neg	Very ashamed, as I had an old Logitech mouse that lasted for 5+ years
1109	neg	Their quality has declined
1109	neg	Do NOT get this mouse if you want something that lasts
1109	neg	Or you can waste money on a new one every year
1110	neg	The left house button won't stay held down
1110	neg	this is honestly sad because this mouse is near perfect the only other problem I've is the weird button layout  I'm always accidentally pressing buttons when I don't intend to
1110	neg	But to its credit I did have this mouse for a year and a half before it broke still disappointing for a 60$ mouse though
1111	pos	The mouse has a great feel, better than the wireless IMO (which I broke) This mouse is also  more durable to abuse
1111	pos	Dont ask me how I know
1112	neg	The double click issue is insane and I've been trying to fix it for a year
1112	neg	Considering buying a cheap mouse to replace this one at this point
1112	neg	not sure what else to do but definitely cant fix it
1112	neg	Tried everything
1113	pos	A few months out and enjoying this mouse being able to adjust the weight is a plus
1113	pos	I like the feel of the mouse it was a great upgrade from my G302
1113	pos	That lasted 6 years hopefully this mouse long as my g302
1114	pos	The fit and feel on the hand is top notch
1114	pos	You can program all buttons to whatever you want
1114	pos	The sniper button is cool on first person shooters in certain games
1114	pos	The tracking sensor is the best I have ever felt with it’s accuracy
1114	pos	I use it on PS4 and it’s awesome
1115	pos	Love this mouse for gaming
1115	pos	Wore out my corsair left click from too much gaming I guess, lol
1115	pos	Bought this one to try out different company
1115	pos	I love it so far
1115	pos	Had it for a few months, gaming almost everyday
1115	pos	No issues so far
1115	pos	By the way I play mostly first and third person shooter games
1116	pos	The infinite spinning scroll wheel with a toggle lock  brother, it’s not the most useful feature all the time, but when it is, it’s awesome
1116	pos	Easily the best value gaming mouse on the market
1116	pos	The cord is a nice lightweight material
1116	pos	I still don’t use a wireless mouse cause they’re for hipsters
1117	neg	Really 100% scam and they know it mouse breaks after a few months starts to double and miss click and feet wear out no matter what after a year they don’t make replacements they need to be sued like Microsoft for stick drift they know of the clicking issue I have owned 6 mice now last one I’m buying
1118	pos	I love this mouse it's the only one I use
1118	pos	My dog chewed the cord and I got another one
1118	pos	They are durable and the colors are nice
1119	neg	The material on the side of the mouse seems to have been fused out
1119	neg	It has been lightly used for 6 months
1119	neg	This should be at least lasting 2 years for use
1119	neg	So disappointed
1120	neg	Left click will release at random and will double click at random only after six months of use was not worth the money
1121	pos	Definitely a comfortable mouse
1121	pos	I am a YouTuber and have been using it for a couple days now, and it has been great so far
1121	pos	Will update if there are any issues but other than that, this mouse is smooth and won’t slide at all on your desk, which my last one did, the weighting stuff comes In a nice packed case so you can change them whenever, and I love the minimal but noticeable RGB, can’t wait until my Blackwidow keyboard comes so I can match it with this mouse
1121	pos	It really is top of the line
1122	pos	Great mouse, good weight that you can adjust with the included additional weights
1122	pos	I have one weight in it and it feels great
1123	pos	Bought three for work and home use
1123	pos	They fit perfectly in larger hands, are very quick to respond and customize
1123	pos	I also like that they have weight - most other mice are too light and therefore harder to control
1123	pos	Highly recommended
1124	pos	I bought this to replace a Corsair Dark Core wireless
1124	pos	The Corsair software was so buggy and would always crash, loose settings etc
1124	pos	Alway at the worst time in a game as well
1124	pos	This logitech is comfortable,  feels great and the software is easy to use and I haven't had any problems
1125	neg	Loved this mouse until the left clicking completely failed, ~9 months into ownership
1125	neg	You will find that purchasing this through amazon you will not get your warranty honored either
1125	neg	Don't buy this mouse, don't buy it on this website
1126	pos	Accurate and has a nice weight to it
1126	pos	I myself like heavier mice, so the option to add weights to it is a big yes
1127	neg	Be aware that if you buy this mouse, it has a very high chance of developing a known double clicking issue
1127	neg	Logitech is well aware of this issue but will still make you jump through hoops to prove that it's happening and THEN deny your warranty claim
1128	neg	I honestly how the button on this feels
1128	neg	It doesn't give you a clear indication of your clicks which I feels is absolutely necessary in a good mouse
1129	neg	Absolutely fantastic mouse for 7 months
1129	neg	Double click problem started a few weeks ago
1129	neg	From reading reddit threads, people say that there's no real fix and it's because of a design flaw
1129	neg	Here's the explainer on the poor design: search "Failing switch problem: Omron vs the modern mouse circuit" on youtubeNever dropped
1129	neg	Regular use, 2 hours a day gaming and regular internet use
1130	neg	Versatile, looks really cool and lots of buttons
1130	neg	Unfortunately it forced my hand into an awkward position mainly because of the button where the thumb should rest
1130	neg	Too uncomfortable
1131	pos	I always get a logitech product if i have a chance, and i would like to use logitech product in gaming
1131	pos	There are no cons in all the product i've used on logitech product which is really good
1131	pos	Its really good with extra 3 buttons on the left
1132	pos	Great in all the ways advertised
1132	pos	Only caveat is that ergonomically speaking, my fingers tend to naturally rest much lower than intended so I don’t quite reach the side buttons (especially the one to lower DPI for small movements) unless I shift my hand farther up and it is a little awkward
1132	pos	Might just be a me problem though since I have small hands for a dude
1133	pos	The mouse wheel is one of the biggest issues i had with this mouse
1133	pos	It got extremely flimsy as time went on and when doing flick shots i can feel the mouse wheel smack the sides when moving the mouse in rapid successions
1133	pos	I play FPS games pretty competitively so this was a huge problem for me
1134	neg	This was the best mouse 4 friends and I could've asked for
1134	neg	we were happy as a clam for about 2-3 weeks
1134	neg	but by the time the 3rd week ended 4/5 of them had broken scroll wheel
1134	neg	meaning it wont sense the scroll
1134	neg	we thought the freestyle and click option for the wheel was cool
1134	neg	but now we're thinking its part of the problem
1134	neg	4/5
1134	neg	come on thats ridiculous
1134	neg	you've failed me for the last time logitech
1134	neg	Only recommended if ur gaming specifically
1134	neg	it seems minor
1134	neg	but next time u are reading a web page or looking at a build for a game
1134	neg	notice how much you scroll
1134	neg	not worth it unless u set them up at tournaments or something where they have no use to the wheel
1135	pos	Solid mouse, I was worried about it being 'heavy' but its perfect for me tbh
1135	pos	I love the dpi lock button aka the sniper button, really clutch in games
1135	pos	Feels pretty ergonomic and I haven't had a problem with it so far
1136	pos	Good quality mouse however the price is lower in stores
1136	pos	I prefer razor streamlined, simple and lightweight design but this one is not bad
1137	neg	I've had this mouse for 3 months now
1137	neg	I've always loved Logitech products but this mouse has problems that make it unusable
1137	neg	Left and right buttons seem to have a mind of their own
1137	neg	Accurate drag and drop is near impossible
1137	neg	Even when applying extra pressure the drop happens randomly and unpredictably
1137	neg	Pressing both buttons to move my WOW character forward sometimes works and sometimes not
1138	pos	I can't say anything bad about this mouse
1138	pos	I got it for my 11yo son's birthday, and he loves it
1138	pos	He didn't like the infinite scroll because of changing weapons in games he plays, but I looked it up and there's a simple button for it to be turned off and on
1138	pos	I programmed some of the buttons for him, and am perfectly ecstatic by his love of this mouse
1138	pos	Definitely recommend
1139	pos	I really like the tilt wheel, good for strafing etc
1139	pos	So many more buttons available and looks awesome
1139	pos	I actually ordered it reluctantly based on the picture online but I like it a LOT more in person fwiw
1140	pos	I love this mouse
1140	pos	Super sensitive and the programmable buttons are awesome as well as the extra weights it comes with
1141	pos	My hands are pushing large, so my thumb is litterly on all three side buttons
1141	pos	You get use to it, but I would rather not 'get use to' something I pay for
1141	pos	I would rather it fit like a glove, but I dont know any company that makes tailor made mouses :)
1142	pos	i was a bit worried that the mouse would look over the top with the sharp edges and all the customizable buttons
1142	pos	it actually looks very clean, especially in a low light settings, and the dpi adjustment on the mouse itself is very useful for gaming and web browsing
1142	pos	the rgb screen sampler is also a super cool feature that i wish my keyboard had as well
1142	pos	in conclusion, i am very satisfied with this purchase, and I’ll update this review depending on the state of the mouse
1143	pos	The weights threw this mouse over the line
1143	pos	This is amazing, I've never had a more comfortable mouse to hold and utilize for 8+ hours on end
1143	pos	Sad, yes
1143	pos	True, even yesser
1143	pos	Should you purchase this amazing cost versus benefit superhero
1143	pos	YES SIR
1143	pos	What
1143	pos	YAAAASSSSS
1144	pos	This is a heavier mouse than most but in my case it helped me out
1144	pos	When I had a cheap red dragon mouse my pinky finger would always scrape on my mouse pad but with this mouse I don’t have this problem
1144	pos	The only problem I really have with this mouse is the scroll wheel rattles a little if you move the mouse too fast but it’s not too big of an issue to deter you from buying it
1145	pos	Not a bad mouse
1145	pos	Only complaint is the wheel is way too sensitive
1146	neg	Great at first
1146	neg	But then the right side of the mouse just stopped working gaming wise
1146	neg	10/10 at first but 1/10 after a few months and for me I don’t play hard core games so I don’t know what happened
1146	neg	I’ve been having a really hard time w/ finding a great mouse and thought I finally found one
1146	neg	But sadly no
1147	pos	I️ am a controller player and I’m making the switch in if and I️ started with the steel series 650 and lemme tell you this mouse if far better
1147	pos	I️ have medium to large hands and this mouse it legit perfect for my
1147	pos	The buttons all seem to be in the perfect spot
1147	pos	Even if you don’t need or want the extra buttons this build and hero sensor is just perfect
1147	pos	Only complaint is the price difference for the wireless version and the scroll wheel
1147	pos	10/10 recommend
1148	pos	Worked alright while the warranty was still active
1148	pos	Would sometimes behave strangely and could not control the mouse
1148	pos	Some static electricity arced and it never worked again
1149	neg	Not even 2 months into having the mouse I started to have issues with the right click button
1149	neg	While I was playing rainbow six siege the mouse would un-ADS me or glitch out/stutter
1149	neg	Scroll wheel is cool but not useful specially because if you flick it till change your weapon
1150	pos	Everything I read about this mouse said it was the bee's knees, but it was way too heavy
1150	pos	Apparently I'm some sort of ogre, because it feels light to me
1150	pos	I'm thinking about using the added weights it includes
1150	pos	I agree with everyone else on the other stuff though, great mouse
1151	pos	Good mouse, very useful programmable buttons
1151	pos	The insert able weights are a nice feature
1151	pos	Price is a bit higher than I would normally pay for a mouse, but couldn't find a similar option for cheaper
1152	pos	Best gaming mouse everThis is the third G502 I owned
1152	pos	G502 is stable and fast respondsRecommend to all gamers
1153	neg	I have a cheaper wireless Logitech mouse that never fails to track but when I use this one the cursor does not move sometimes, keeps starting and stopping like the laser is not seeing the mouse pad
1153	neg	I was going to return but forgot to mail it in time so now I'm stuck with a mouse that I never use
1154	neg	It's a great mouse but it suffers from a double click issue
1154	neg	This is my 2nd G502 Hero mouse, both this one and my first suffered from issues within 6 months of purchase
1154	neg	The first had a double click issue and the second couldn't hold a right click, which made highlighting impossible and rendered any FPS game unplayable
1154	neg	I'm  on my third currently, as I thought the first two were just duds
1154	neg	If my current one develops an issue, then it'll be the last logitech product I buy
1155	neg	The mouse was fantastic for me during the first 3 months, with great features and a solid weight
1155	neg	However, I began to encounter drift issues and the mouse randomly not working unless I unplug and replug the USB
1155	neg	No amount of troubleshooting could fix this
1155	neg	It could be possible that i got unlucky, but judging from other reviews there are other issues that plague this mouse and Logitech's QA/QC
1155	neg	If you do get a fully functioning mouse, it's great
1156	pos	Although it doesn't really affect the usage of it at all, it seems one of the lights for the mouse isn't working, more specifically the one near the G5 button
1156	pos	That aside, though, it's a great mouse that's great for gaming
1156	pos	It feels comfortable on my hand and it's very responsive
1156	pos	Would definitely recommend this to anyone getting into PC gaming
1157	pos	Fits nice in your hand, glides ever so smoothly over the surface
1157	pos	Love the interchangeable weights that come with it
1158	neg	This is the second time I have purchased the Logitech G502 HERO
1158	neg	Both my mice have failed on me in less than a year
1158	neg	They both got the double clicking issue that slowly gets worse until your mouse breaks
1158	neg	The first time I made a warranty claim, Logitech never responded
1158	neg	I moved on and purchased another G502 HERO because I had faith in Logitech and their mice
1158	neg	I'm finding that their mice don't last and Logitech will not stand by their product
1158	neg	Steer clear
1158	neg	I have learned my lesson
1159	pos	I'm not sure why this mouse gets so many bad reviews, but its amazing
1159	pos	People are complaining about build quality but I'm sure the issues with the mouse breaking is user error
1159	pos	Overall the build quality is very solid and extremely comfortable in the hand
1159	pos	The RGB lights are very vibrant and also has tons of customizations for the buttons
1159	pos	Overall a very well built mouse for the money
1160	neg	The mouse itself was excellent while it lasted
1160	neg	Felt great, adjustable weights, etc
1160	neg	But I started noticing the right click would let go after about 7 months
1160	neg	I play a lot of FPS and while I'm trying to hold down the right click button, it just acts like I am letting go of it
1160	neg	Now, 8 months in, the mouse doesn't even register most of my clicks, unless I am extremely forceful with it
1160	neg	Very disappointed for a mouse of this caliber
1161	pos	It took some time getting used to because it was bigger than my old mouse (logitech g300s) , but once I got used to it, it's really a good mouse
1161	pos	I got it for less than 50 dollars so it feels like a steal
1161	pos	Would definitely recommend
1161	pos	You can even put weights in it to make it heavier and tinker with the feel
1162	neg	Had the mouse for less than half a year before it started having issues double clicking
1162	neg	Seems to be a consistent problem for Logitech mouse
1163	pos	There is a reason this is the most popular gaming mouse ever
1163	pos	It has a great feel, is fairly light and the software was easy to use
1163	pos	At full price it might have some competitors, but if you catch it on sale it’s a no-brainer
1164	neg	After 3 months of use, lmb can no longer be held down
1164	neg	It randomly releases no matter how firmly I press
1164	neg	You can search the reviews and see that this problem is really common
1164	neg	I didn't really love the feel of the mouse
1164	neg	It was ok, but not amazing for my big hands
1164	neg	I'm probably in a minority on that one considering how popular it is
1164	neg	My main issue is just the fact that the switch isn't well made and breaks in mere months
1165	pos	Got this for my boyfriend for the holidays and he said he loves it so much more than is older mouse
1165	pos	It also comes with different weights to put in it which I guess is good for gaming
1165	pos	If you’re looking for a gaming mouse, this is the one
1166	neg	I like the feel and features enough that when the right mouse button became intermittent on my first purchase after about 6 months, I chalked it up to a fluke issue and bought a second one
1166	neg	When the same right mouse button issue showed up on the second mouse I purchased @ 4 months in, I moved on to another brand
1167	pos	I use this mouse for gaming on my Xbox One X
1167	pos	My hands are a little on the larger side, and this mouse is perfect for me because my had just naturally falls into place with this mouse
1167	pos	The response time is amazing and the ability to change your DPI on the fly is very useful for me
1168	pos	So far it is a good mouse
1168	pos	Lot of features
1168	pos	Fit is good
1168	pos	Response is right on
1168	pos	Time will tell if it holds up
1169	neg	Out of the blue, starting today, the mouse will randomly perform a right-click
1169	neg	I have removed the GHub software, removed the mouse from device manager, rebooted, checked for malware, reinstalled the GHub software (latest version)
1169	neg	nothing helps it
1169	neg	I do a little research online and find out that right-clicking already has some issues with this model
1169	neg	We can add this to the list: screw you, I'm just going to right click for you, whether you want me to or not
1170	pos	I bought this for my son and he loves it
1170	pos	it has a large dpi range which is great for your personal customization and the RGB on the mouse is customizable
1170	pos	the 11 programmable buttons are great for gaming
1170	pos	the mouse is built very well
1170	pos	I would suggest buying this mouse whenever it is on sale if you are looking for a gaming mouse
1171	pos	Wanted to upgrade from my M510 for gaming, this mouse is great
1171	pos	The adjustable weight alone makes it worth buying
1171	pos	The adjustable sensitivity, extra programable buttons, and RGB are icing on the cake
1172	pos	Very comfortable, lots of buttons and is accurate
1172	pos	Great buy
1173	neg	I hear the call of the blue falcon as he swoops down upon this mouseKaka
1173	neg	Kaka
1174	neg	I bought this mouse in April and used it for gaming
1174	neg	The left mouse button is already going out
1174	neg	I am extremely upset
1174	neg	My previous mouse was a $30 no-name brand knock off from China and it lasted me three years so this kind of quality for a $65 brand name mouse is incredibly disappointing
1175	pos	My 9 year old is ecstatic over this mouse
1175	pos	It ‘clicks super fast’ and is programmable to make the buttons do different things
1175	pos	He said ‘I Would recommend
1175	pos	’
1176	pos	Pretty nice mouse, I have long fingers so this is perfect for me, I would've hoped that most of these buttons weren't DPI buttons but that's my only complaint
1177	neg	Mouse would be great, were it not for the early failure of the left mouse button on both the mouse I originally bought and the replacement I received under warranty
1177	neg	Serious engineering flaw that must be fixed before I can rate this mouse worth purchasing
1177	neg	In its current state, I would not accept money to put this mouse on my desk
1178	pos	only giving it 3 stars because you can get an item with more buttons for a bit more
1178	pos	One complaint I have about this mouse is the buttons
1178	pos	they are in an awkward location for me at least
1178	pos	I have the razer naga trinity and i love it
1178	pos	I guess this will be a good mouse for all ninja fans lol
1179	pos	No complaints but plenty of praise
1179	pos	I have large hands and the mouse is very comfortable
1179	pos	I like how I can sync up my head set and keyboard with the RGB
1179	pos	The weights that come in the box have made it the perfect mouse for me
1180	pos	The best mouse since the main series
1180	pos	Ive bought this is my 4th of that "line"
1180	pos	I dont need anything else
1181	neg	I purchased directly through Amazon and not through a 3rd party seller
1181	neg	Just like another reviewer, I received a used item
1181	neg	I noticed when I opened up the package, the pads on the bottom of the mouse looked scuffed up
1181	neg	Another dead giveaway, the serial number on the mouse does not match up with the serial number on the box
1181	neg	When purchasing, double check your mouse to make sure you're not getting a used product
1182	pos	This mouse is fantastic
1182	pos	It's very comfortable to hold, the buttons are easily accessible, the weights are a nice touch
1182	pos	My only beef is not with the mouse, it's the program Logitech has to change the settings on the mouse
1182	pos	I hate it
1182	pos	Five stars for the quality of the mouse, zero stars for the Logitch G Hub
1183	pos	The wire is a tad bit cheap but that’s to be expected when you use this mouse for it’s amazing price deal
1183	pos	And it’s sensor is so good for gaming I recommend for gamers and if you use a normal office mouse it’s gonna take a day or so to get used to the new shape and not so much support
1184	pos	Good for work, comfortable and reliable, my right hand never feel hurt or tired again after day long work
1185	pos	Coming from my older Corsair Sabre, I'm now a fanboy of the Logitech HERO series
1185	pos	The weights are great, solid materials, doesn't feel flimsy at all, extremely smooth glide even on an old mouse pad
1185	pos	Definitely consider this one of, if not the, premier mice out there
1186	neg	So, long story short; I needed a new mouse
1186	neg	This one was already a bit wonky when I got it, but I brushed it off as just needing to get used to it
1186	neg	Over the course of two months, I can no longer even left click with this mouse
1186	neg	I've had to dig up the one it was supposed to replace, because even half broken, it performs better than this one at the basic functionality a mouse is supposed to do
1186	neg	Stay far away from this, or any other, Logitech mice
1187	pos	I have 4 of these mice now
1187	pos	Two on my gaming systems and one on each kids systems
1187	pos	They are amazing and have lots of buttons to customize
1188	pos	I'm very smooth reaction time is perfect
1188	pos	It comes with extra weights for the bottom of the mouse 2 guarantee every movement of your hand
1188	pos	My son loves this mouse more than any previous Mouse he has used for his gaming
1188	pos	100% the best one I have bought
1188	pos	And I have bought 11 of them from Amazon
1189	pos	I like gaming mousses, and this is by far my favorite
1189	pos	It has such a sleek design, it's durable, it's ergonomic and it's button clicks are great
1189	pos	But by far, the best feature is the scroll wheel
1189	pos	It has a nice heavy feel, and it has a magic button to make it spin for as long as you'd like
1189	pos	The software is great, has some of it's glitches, and I'd wish that this mouse had more RGB, but it this definitely the best bang for your buck
1190	pos	Its a mouse
1190	pos	It works
1190	pos	Why oh why would they make it so the lights won't turn off when the pc is off
1190	pos	Don't bump the mouse before bed time
1191	pos	The mouse is very solid and the weight of it is great
1191	pos	I’ve been using the G305 mouse for awhile and it’s a good mouse but I have a tendency to pick it up accidentally while playing a game because of its light weight and I wanted a mouse that weighed more and this is the perfect mouse for it
1191	pos	The G502’s quality is excellent and it feels great in my hand
1192	pos	Sheeeesh
1192	pos	Let me tell you when I say this mouse is top tier it really is
1192	pos	It feels so good especially with all of the weights on
1192	pos	The grip feels good, the button responses are good, and the customization is a sick bonus like omg
1192	pos	Got this while it was on sale for 40 bucks and I can for sure say this mouse worth so much more
1192	pos	Don't wait cop now 🙂
1193	neg	Bought this mouse for myself and my girlfriend about a year ago, mine is still running fine but hers broke down after only a couple months of moderate use
1193	neg	Something about the clicks imputing as double clicks and not holding down when trying to click and drag
1193	neg	Read reviews online about shoddy internal parts that they cheaped out on
1194	pos	I love the infinite, weighted scroll wheel
1194	pos	It's also a very beautiful and customizable mouse
1194	pos	The 11 buttons that can be customized using LG's software are well placed
1194	pos	The mouse fits perfectly in the hand, and the hatch for the weights is very easy to access if there are multiple users of the computer
1194	pos	The only slight annoyance is that the scroll wheel can be slightly noisy, but it tracks pages very well
1195	pos	My 11yo loves this gaming mouse
1195	pos	According to him it's the best and coolest gaming mouse
1195	pos	Very satisfied
1196	pos	Was needing a Replacement for my Old mouse and i gotta say Iv been missing out, Having its own software to set you're dpi to your exact needs is great
1196	pos	I dont really care for the RGB but the mouse overall is really nice and has been working great for playing casual and competitive games
1196	pos	It fits perfect for my hand and all the extra mouse buttons are great for rebinding things like a quick melee or things of that sort
1197	pos	This is a great mouse but it’s a little chunky and hard to get my hand around
1197	pos	Maybe it’s becaude I’m new to pc but the expected places to grip the mouse feel bulky
1197	pos	Otherwise, this is a great mouse, super responsive, love the customization, but at the end of the day
1197	pos	is it worth the cost
1197	pos	Probably not
1198	pos	My son had one of these for over 3 years and one button went out so he asked me to get him another one
1198	pos	He just loves using it for his computer games
1199	pos	Amazing for ~40 bucks
1199	pos	No problems with mine, clicks can be a bit springy sometimes but its quiet so i never notice so it doesn't bother me
1200	pos	Worked great for a while until a few years later the left mouse button started miss clicking
1200	pos	Won't be buying another Logitech gaming mouse again
1200	pos	There quality has gone down in recent years
1201	pos	only con is that the thumb buttons are a bit low -- or i have wide thumbs
1201	pos	Sometimes accidentally click M4 when moving the mouse which can be a huge pain while gaming depending on your binds
1202	pos	Given the fact that in my country this mouse sells for almost 100 USD, buying it for 37 felt okay
1202	pos	The mouse is good
1202	pos	The added weights are a great thing and I really want these type of weights to be added to many more mice
1202	pos	One thing I didn't expect was the three-lines zone to only light up when I change the DPI
1202	pos	Otherwise, great mouse
1203	neg	Can't even use the mouse at all now, every time I try doing something the mouse causes my browser to go back a page, and sometimes it will just make it impossible to do anything at times
1203	neg	I know it's defective because I tried another cheap mouse from Walmart in the same USB port and that mouse works fine, and once I unplugged the defective mouse the malfunctioning stopped
1203	neg	Probably just got unlucky, but i'm still rather disappointed that it stopped working within a month
1204	pos	I was looking for a replacement for my Microsoft Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 2
1204	pos	0 which finally died on me
1204	pos	This isn't it
1204	pos	The G502 isn't as comfortable/ergonomic as the Intellimouse, and the scroll wheel is noisy
1204	pos	It clicks constantly while scrolling, which is driving me nuts
1204	pos	Going to return
1205	pos	had a little problem with mine after about a year, but they replaced it with no problems at all
1205	pos	new one still working great
1206	pos	Enough programmable buttons for most fps games, adjust your sensitivity on the fly, ergonomic for ease of use, would recommend getting a cushioned mousepad along with it
1206	pos	The Logitech software is a necessity if you want to program the buttons and adjust the sensitivity levels, rgb, etc
1206	pos	After less than one year of use, the mouse’s electrical contact is faulty and wont register long clicks anymore
1206	pos	Very frustrating for gaming :(
1207	pos	It’s a great mouse I recommend it 100% awesome features in the software
1207	pos	However, the scroll wheel has little resistance in the non infinant scroll mode
1208	pos	I like the size texture colors and how you could know what you changed your mouse DPi too
1208	pos	But when I was playing Roblox I have to hold right click most of the time so I can move around my screen but sometimes it just lags really badly and the screen goes all over the place also I wish you could have added a DPI lock because sometimes when I play I press a button to go up or down DPI and it messes up my perspective and I have to change it again
1208	pos	I also wish the DPI rate was always lit up so I can see if it went down or up
1209	pos	What can I say, went with most buttons and customization
1209	pos	Unlimited profiles and keys, highly recommend for productive or gaming activities
1210	neg	I had my dad by me this for Christmas and the right click fell apart within 3 months
1210	neg	Before I realized I had a problem I bought one for my brother for his birthday
1210	neg	It is so bad when you hold right click it disengages multiple times without letting go of the button (makes it impossible to play fps, even had a heck of a time in warcraft spinning the camera) I had the g500 for years and thought this would be the new great mouse I could have for a while
1210	neg	Thought very wrong
1210	neg	Was pretty disappointed I like the Logitech brand but this makes me shy away from it now
1210	neg	The fact that they still sell this is ridiculous
1211	pos	Rock solid mouse that will be used in photo editing and media production
1211	pos	The adjustable resolution of the mouse is great, as are the weights and lighting effects
1212	pos	There's honestly just two many buttons for my liking
1212	pos	I'm going to have to reprogram my games, and one of the buttons isn't recognized by my rig or Steam
1212	pos	Quality materials and great sensitivity tho
1212	pos	It also looks pretty badass, so that's also a plus
1213	pos	Awesome mouse
1213	pos	Only issue the right n left click are the first things to start messing up
1214	neg	Have been a Logitech fan for a while, had a couple MX510's back in the day, and most recently a MX518 lasting 10+ years
1214	neg	The G502 was a huge disappointment, from the get-go, the middle mouse button rattled when moving side to side, in both locked and unlocked position
1214	neg	Read forums that it's a common occurrence
1214	neg	Additionally, the buttons are crammed so close together that it's inevitable to click something else unintentionally (am a person with skinny fingers)
1214	neg	Going to stick to my old MX518 for a while longer
1215	neg	I bought this because my old G502 was getting old, and started to DOUBLE RIGHT CLICK
1215	neg	Since I liked my old G502 I decided to get another one, this time it was the new version
1215	neg	First week of use and the double RIGHT clicking started only while in game
1215	neg	I contacted support but the live chat is terrible, the emails I got from an "expert technician" was just copy / paste stuff that I've already tried before contacting support
1216	pos	My son plays Minecraft games where you need to click very fast to fight off creepers or other players and he loves this mouse
1216	pos	Great feel and seems to be good quality
1217	pos	Has a nice weight, buttons are good, only problem is the scroll wheel
1217	pos	It holds gunk and is incredibly hard to clean
1218	pos	Bought this for the hubby to play his games on his computer
1218	pos	He likes it a lot & works great
1219	pos	Es mi primer gaming mouse y nunca pense que el rendimiento mejorara tanto con el cambio de mouse
1219	pos	Es espectacular muy recomendado
1220	pos	able to map your hot buttons
1220	pos	weighted to what u want
1220	pos	rgb
1220	pos	and i mean RGBbro this scroll wheel is the best ive ever used so far
1221	pos	not bad for a budget mouse
1221	pos	the weights make no noticeable difference, generally over sensitive regardless of mouse sensitivity setting
1221	pos	what i mean by that is you have to exit your game to make a noticeable difference in mouse sensitivity settings, the sensitivity button on the mouse seems to do nothing
1222	pos	It was my first time transitioning over from controller to mouse and keyboard
1222	pos	I play a lot of Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone, it’s very convenient how you can customize the side buttons to your playing style
1222	pos	The additional weights that you can put in the mouse are also a plus, it gives you that quality feel with the mouse compared to others
1222	pos	Overall, really great mouse
1222	pos	Would recommend getting it and at least try it
1223	neg	I absolutely loved this mouse when I first got it
1223	neg	If you do a lot of fps gaming where you aim down sights then shoot don't get this mouse
1223	neg	It feels great has lots of good features but after about 3 months the macro switches went out
1223	neg	Every click was a double or triple click
1223	neg	I couldn't aim down sights any more
1223	neg	I couldn't even drag windows to other monitors it would just drop them
1224	pos	Had this mouse over a year and still loving it
1224	pos	Scroll a bit noisy, if scrolling alot
1224	pos	But can unlock to go crazy, which turns out i like to use alot
1224	pos	I love these logitech designs for my hands on long mmorpg sessions
1225	pos	I will just logitech has made quality mice for a little while now
1225	pos	Personally for gaming I love this mouse
1225	pos	I am not saying this is the best mouse ever but for the money I personally don't think you can find a better gaming mouse especially for shooters
1226	pos	Best mouse I have ever used
1226	pos	Feels amazing and the rgb is really cool
1226	pos	The mouse actually knows to stop glowing when computer is in sleep mode too
1226	pos	The scroll wheel has 2 modes, both feel like they are going to work properly for a long time
1227	pos	Would recommend this to anyone
1227	pos	I really love mine
1227	pos	Comfortable and moves easily
1227	pos	Plus you can add weights to your liking
1228	pos	I used to use a cheap mouse that was not controlled by any software or anything like that and it was kind of heavy
1228	pos	but i got this one when it was on sell so it was the best buy
1228	pos	you are able to customize all the extra keys that are on the mouse and on top of that the clicks feel really nice and if you are a gaming i would recommend this mouse any day
1229	pos	Got this mouse for an RPG game, LOL, overwatch, etc
1229	pos	Works great
1229	pos	like the add-on weight, it makes the mouse feel "right"
1229	pos	the only thing I had is DPS setting changs couple time by itself, maybe I accidentally click the dps button in the middle of an intensive game fight
1230	pos	I opened this up and the glide pads on the bottom of the mouse were all dented and it looked used
1230	pos	I like the mouse and its buttons, but I hate the wire
1230	pos	I have always used a wireless,  but wanted a gaming mouse
1230	pos	Everyone says don't get a wireless, but with today's technology is that really a big deal anymore
1230	pos	I am giving it  another week
1231	neg	My mouse was working great until the scroll wheel wont pick up scrolling anymore the mouse grip is very uncomfortable if you have bigger hands the scroll wheel on this mouse is just absolutely garbage there's no grip to it and it just slips from your fingers when gaming
1232	pos	Great for gaming can adjust weight and sensitivity easily the wire is long enough for my setup and love the feel of it
1233	pos	Use this primarily for gaming, love the unlocking scroll wheel, as well as the adjustable weight
1233	pos	If you’re using a Corsair or Razer mouse it may feel a little awkward at first switching over at first, but I definitely recommend it
1233	pos	My only gripe is I feel like the mouse is a little to small, but like I said before it’s just awkward to start and you get used to it
1234	pos	first off amazon dont tell me what words to use in my review i will avoid those words now
1234	pos	love the mouse works awesome playing cold war and wooping butt
1235	pos	I have been using this mouse for a couple of weeks now and have gotten familiar with the button layout now
1235	pos	I like the extra added weight that comes with the mouse
1235	pos	I have had absolutely no issues so far
1235	pos	Would recommend if you need a few extra buttons for gaming
1236	pos	Rookie gamer here, I read reviews and bought it on sale, pretty happy with e, it’s more responsive than a regular mouse that’s for sure, still getting use to it, I wished I bought wireless thou, I thought it was, lol
1237	neg	But after only a year, I've had 2 warranty replacements and the last one just had the exact same failure
1237	neg	After even mild use, the right mouse button starts to not respond, or respond only randomly
1237	neg	I love the design, the free spinning wheel option, the custom weight, but those features mean absolutely nothing if your primary mouse button hardware fails within 4-6 months
1237	neg	For those of you that still want to buy it, Logitech is well aware of the issue, and their agents will ship you a new one when yours fails with no hassle
1237	neg	My last replacement call lasted all of 7 minutes
1238	pos	It’s been a pretty good mouse
1238	pos	it hasn’t ran away yet, but doesn’t like the cheese I’ve been feeding it
1239	pos	Works as well as my Razer Basilisk did
1239	pos	Very little difference other than looks between the two
1239	pos	I did find the material to feel a little flimsy, but overall, it does what Logitech says it does
1240	neg	Just dead after turning on my PC one day
1240	neg	Wouldn't light up, wouldn't move, it wasn't even in my Device Manager
1240	neg	I'm about to contact Logitech and have a warranty so I'm sure it will be taken care of but it is a big pain to have to do this
1240	neg	I know hardware can go out sometimes but a mouse shouldn't have a problem like this
1241	neg	Tracking is buggy and inconsistent at best and flat out unresponsive at worst
1241	neg	DPI and profile shifting, changing surfaces, changing USB ports, and searching for driver updates have no effect
1241	neg	I would say its only good for clicking on Youtube videos but apparently they are notorious for left click issues
1241	neg	Never buying Logitrash again
1242	neg	It's now September 19th and my g502 hero is already experiencing double click issues with the left click button, which makes most games nigh unplayable
1242	neg	I'm upset because every single Logitech mouse I've owned thusfar (g500, g700s) had been amazing
1242	neg	Additionally, since I ordered from Amazon they've been absolutely horrific about getting me a return
1242	neg	I don't think it's too much to ask that my mouse lasts more than 3
1242	neg	5 months when I'm paying $60
1243	pos	I like the macro key customization for any of the buttons on it
1243	pos	It's comfortable I like the whieghts you can add to it I like using all of them good heavy mouse so I can do fine detail things in games and such really a all around good gaming mouse
1244	pos	I had a regular G502 when it was released and loved it
1244	pos	I ended up giving that away and bought the G502 hero and I absolutely love it
1244	pos	Same great feel with same great comfort
1244	pos	The only thing I feel in this mouse is that when moving quickly, you hear a rattle
1244	pos	Hopefully that's not something loose inside but no issues so far
1245	pos	Loved the fact it came with gram plates to enhance the sensitivity mine has 10
1245	pos	5 grams added to it and outstanding performance
1246	pos	Love it been using for years bought a second to have on hand
1247	pos	The only complain i have is that I accidentally fat finger the mouse speed buttons
1247	pos	However, it’s not the products fault I have such sausage fingers
1247	pos	There is an app you can download, where you can set a mouse speed and it won’t change if you hit the buttons like I do
1247	pos	Overall it’s a great mouse and is the definition of customizable
1248	pos	Good mouse overall
1248	pos	Not as comfortable as my old MX510
1248	pos	My only issue is the bright LED lights logitec put on it
1248	pos	If you bump the mouse at night the lights turn on and iluminate the room
1248	pos	Remove the stupid LEDs and this is the perfect mouse
1248	pos	Or maybe logitec should get into the nightlight game
1249	neg	Love this mouse, bought as a backup to the same model
1249	neg	Hate the shipping negligence of putting a shipping sticker on the product packaging and mailing it as-is
1249	neg	Mine came in badly dinged
1249	neg	not happy
1249	neg	Protect your product
1250	neg	A mouse wheel should be made of soft rubber, so that the finger can rotate it easily
1250	neg	This wheel is made of hard plastic that is too slick and I am continually wetting my finger trying to get traction
1250	neg	There is a toggle button below the wheel that makes the wheel too easy to spin - and it bounces continually
1250	neg	Otherwise the mouse seems fine
1250	neg	But - the wheel thing is too annoying
1250	neg	Returning
1251	neg	The mouse was good while it lasted, few months in there was sticking during usage
1251	neg	There were no unknown substances on my mousepad and the bottom of the mouse was clean but it would still give sluggish and last responses while tracking
1251	neg	Mouse was comfortable albeit not a great match for those with smaller hands, had a hard time reaching buttons with my thumb
1251	neg	Ended up replacing with a razor basilisk v2
1252	pos	I loved this product
1252	pos	I initially bought this for gaming, but now it’s just my regular mouse
1252	pos	Somehow it makes even doing my schoolwork easier—
1252	pos	I love the programmable 11 buttons
1252	pos	It’s very useful
1252	pos	I love the adjustable weights, but personally so keep all weights in my mouse for the heaviest/most weighted
1252	pos	I will100% be buying this for my friends as gifts or something
1252	pos	I just wanna share this with them, because this mouse is the best
1253	pos	the ONLY reason I would not give it a full 5 stars, is that the mouse wheel buttons, where you slide the mouse wheel left or right, have a habit of activating when you only wanted to use the center click
1253	pos	I didn't need them, so my solution was to leave them unbound, but then again, it could have been the way I was pushing the center mouse wheel
1253	pos	Over all, would buy again
1254	neg	Bought in March and now does not work, reinstalling drivers didn't work
1254	neg	Mouse randomly doubleclicks or fails to hold a click
1254	neg	This is seriously the last logitech mouse I'll own given the AWFUL QC they have going on
1255	neg	The mouse is fantastic for the first handful of months, but after that the cheap switches they use causes clicking problems and ruin the whole experience
1255	neg	Left-clicking and dragging becomes nearly impossible and constant double clicking occur
1255	neg	I've used 3 different G502 mouses and each one has had this problem occur, while the hundreds of other complaints I've read online repeating the same problem
1255	neg	I personally would not suggest this mouse if you desire to have a good mouse that will work for more then 5 months
1256	pos	My old Logitech gaming mouse finally died after probably 10 years of heavy use, so I decided to get this one
1256	pos	It works very well and fits right in my hand
1256	pos	It also has very useful features in its software
1256	pos	I highly recommend it
1257	pos	I do not like the middle mouse scroll wheel
1257	pos	There is zero resistance so gaming is odd
1257	pos	You scroll up or down and since there is no resistance it will scroll a little the opposite direction when you take your finger off it
1258	pos	I love this
1258	pos	Easy on the hands I went from a sense to this and I wouldn't go back at all
1258	pos	Custom button mapping is also a plus
1259	pos	This mouse is alright
1259	pos	After couple of months, I can hear something moving inside when I shake it
1259	pos	Mouse pointer jumps randomly sometimes
1259	pos	But this might be because I am using it on a dark surface
1260	pos	The software to configure the mouse (G-HUB) is a pain and silly
1260	pos	Luckily you do not need the software to use the mouse, but it is needed for the initial configuration and tweaking
1260	pos	After you have found your desired settings you can save the settings to the mouse's on-board memory and uninstall the software
1261	pos	It's a great mouse, a little small for me and unfortunately the right click started going out
1261	pos	I can't return it to Amazon because it's past the time I can return it so I have to work through the manufacturer
1261	pos	Can't give it 5 stars after it only lasting a month
1262	pos	This mouse is great I love it
1262	pos	At first I was a little confused on how to program the buttons but after I looked it up online and downloaded the logitech program for this mouse it all went smoothly
1262	pos	The program is extremely easy to use and you can program any button to do almost anything
1262	pos	The scroll wheel is nice and I love how there is a button each way you push the scroll wheel (left or right)
1262	pos	10/10 rating I would recommend
1262	pos	Best customizable mouse you can find
1263	pos	Pretty solid mouse
1263	pos	Only complaint is that the mouse wheel isn't as tacky as I'd like
1264	pos	It is easier to use wirelessly when not playing games
1265	pos	Many of the "extra" buttons are a bit further up the mouse, so if you don't tend to palm grip your mouse and or have decently long fingers beware of that
1265	pos	You wont get much out of this mouse if that is the case
1265	pos	The mouse wheel is kind of a big deal to me
1265	pos	That thing is quite loud in standard mode and requires more force to press in than it should making it difficult to use in gaming, and this is meant to be a gaming mouse
1265	pos	Free wheel mode is something I've never seen before, it hardly makes a sound in that mode but I prefer not to use it very often
1266	neg	If you look online Logitech's mice have consistent problems with their Omron switches
1266	neg	There are too many cases of them wearing down and malfunctioning after a few months of use
1266	neg	The warranty process of getting a new mouse was extremely annoying and I ultimately gave up
1266	neg	Look into a mouse with optical switches or a company that doesn't run into constant problems with "double-clicking"
1267	pos	yay, i like the mouse, and now I have to write a long review that actually isn't helpful and is just to allow me to press submit
1268	neg	It only last 4 months before start failing the right button, it got double click then, at 8 month it start double clicking on the left button, now 14 months after buy, it just lost the lefth click
1268	neg	it is a cool mouse and very ergonomic, but for the price, i could spect more
1269	pos	My absolute favorite mouse, and the software actually worked for this one (unlike the last
1269	pos	)
1270	pos	Nice corded mouse for gaming and everyday use
1271	pos	Ergonomic but the scroll is really bad
1271	pos	the mouse is comfortable but the mouse wheel is very bad, it cannot be adjusted and it is very annoying when playing shooters and I have to change weapons or objects
1272	neg	Three months after purchase the mouse began double left clicking on occasion
1272	neg	Four months after purchase and the left click has stopped working completely
1272	neg	This is a cheaply made product that has probably put me off Logitech products for good
1273	pos	Does great, I had the original g502 and it worked great so I thought I'd get this one with the new sensor
1273	pos	The sensor on this does amazing at picking up fast movements and making sure it gets transmitted into the game
1273	pos	I am very happy with this purchase
1274	neg	Bought a G502 Hero for me and my wife, both developed double clicking issues on the left and right mouse buttons after only a month
1274	neg	Customer support has been terrible, and has given me the runaround for over a month when all I want is to RMA my mouse
1274	neg	I have purchased Logitech my whole life, but this will be the last mouse I purchase from them
1274	neg	Blatant time wasting so they do not have to replace my mouse
1275	pos	I loved it so much that I've been gifting this to all my friends
1275	pos	I like the way my hand sits on the mouse
1276	neg	Actual trash, low quality product
1276	neg	DO NOT BUY, I have bought so many logitech devices in the past
1276	neg	This has to be the worst, stopped working after 6 months
1276	neg	I have the old original G502
1276	neg	I have had it for 5 years and counting, but this HERO mouse is garbage
1276	neg	( bought 2, both broke within months)
1277	pos	It’s awesome
1277	pos	everything you need
1278	pos	At first I really liked this mouse, and thought very highly of it
1278	pos	After about a week of use though I started to notice how extremely sensitive and loose the scroll wheel was, which for me wasn’t good for the way I rest my finger on the scroll wheel
1278	pos	So in games like Rainbow Six Siege I would accidentally switch my gun in the middle of shooting someone, which got really annoying, so I decided to return it
1279	pos	The mouse is perfect
1279	pos	I’ve been using it for a little while now and it hasn’t been a disappointment, as it functions perfectly and it feels exceptional to hold
1279	pos	I have a G203 as well and I have to remind myself that I still own it because I’m always using the G502
1279	pos	Overall an incredible mouse, great build quality, performance, and looks
1280	pos	I enjoy being able to change the weight of the mouse depending on what I'm doing
1280	pos	With the software from Logitech it makes doing anything a breeze
1280	pos	I've created profiles for when I'm coding so that I can more easily copy, paste, and anything else I need to do within the programming language
1281	pos	Excellent value for the money
1281	pos	Has a lot of great features & is easy to setup using the Logitech software suite
1282	pos	I am a gamer and i love the products made by logitech, and this one surprised me the most
1282	pos	the build quality is amazing, fully customisable mouse buttons, the option to make mouse setting “profiles”, and even changing the weight of the mouse and comfortable feel on your hands is amazing
1282	pos	100% would recommend, amazing bang for your buck
1283	neg	I bought 2 of these mice and I use them for competitive fortnite after I had them for a bout 4 months it started doing wired stuff like turning off for no reason then my scroll wheel started locking up and would get stuck and then one of them just wouldn’t work out of nowhere now just today my one that is left I’ve had it for a bout 6 months now it’s now double clicking and this mouse is also really heavy my wrist herts all the time cause of how heavy it is
1284	pos	With the logitech programn it makes it easy to set this mouse up and the price is perfect this is my second  1st one lasted years
1285	pos	I was so disappointed when Logitech stopped making the G9X years back
1285	pos	If you loved the G9X, you will really love this mouse
1286	neg	Got this mouse in February 2019, now it is early August and it is almost unusable due to double clicking issue
1286	neg	this was a replacement for my razer mouse that did the same thing
1287	pos	This mouse is Great
1287	pos	I’ve played Fortnite, Cold War , modern warfare, Roblox & Rage 2… This mouse preformed well
1287	pos	The only dislike i have with this particular gaming mouse is that the scroll wheel is really lose
1287	pos	Scrolling once will actually scroll multiple times & that can get kinda annoying
1287	pos	Overall great for the buck
1288	pos	I love my mouse; since I was used to get mouses for about $10 - $15, this is the most expensive I've ever bought
1288	pos	Pros: everything: feels premium, works perfect, fits perfect (I have big hands), I use it's whole weight and I love it, I hate light mice, so it's a good choice
1288	pos	I don't regret it
1289	neg	Had the mouse just over a year and both left and right mouse buttons started spam clicking it started with the right mouse switch and then the left switch started actin up
1289	neg	Replaced them but i am not buying logitech ever again
1289	neg	its a no brainer that you shouldnt buy something new that will require replacement parts in less than a year
1290	pos	I'm never buying any other mouse
1290	pos	The extra buttons are very useful, it has the perfect size for my hand, lot's of costumization, very precise but it is heavy
1291	pos	The G502 Hero is a nice and responsive mouse with nice features and customizing
1291	pos	I had a G502 Proteus Spectrum before buying it
1291	pos	The only problem I have with it is when you move your mouse the middle mouse key jiggles around which causes the mouse to shake accompanied by an annoying rattling sound
1291	pos	It makes no difference whether the wheel is on freespin or not
1291	pos	My Proteus Spectrum doesn't have this problem and it's mouse wheel is functionally the same
1291	pos	I will keep using my Proteus Spectrum
1292	pos	I struggle with a lot of gaming mice because they're simply too big for me
1292	pos	This is the second incarnation of this mouse that I have purchased, the first being the Logitech proteus spectrum
1292	pos	Everything is reachable and comfortable for small hands
1293	pos	Best mouse yet for gaming
1293	pos	Would recommend to anyone
1293	pos	A friend recommended it to me :)
1294	pos	I'm on my third mouse due to the left click failing (multi clicks, failing to recognize clicks, etc), but they seem to last 6-8 months under heavy usage
1294	pos	For the price it's tolerable, but not by much
1295	pos	I'm new to PC gaming
1295	pos	Switched over from console(ps4)
1295	pos	I looked at several different gaming mouses and watched a bunch of videos
1295	pos	And I must say I'm glad I chose this
1295	pos	It's perfect
1295	pos	Feels good in my right hand
1296	pos	Our son asked for this model after doing online research
1296	pos	He's been using it for a few months now, and is very pleased with the product
1297	pos	Love the weight and feel of this mouse
1297	pos	The multiple settings and onboard memory make it easy to switch between tasks and preferences, and operating systems (I use Windows, Linux, and MacOS)
1297	pos	Matches my Logitech G810 keyboard perfectly
1297	pos	Would definitely recommend and buy again
1298	pos	Works as intended
1298	pos	hero sensor has grade A tracking, ergonomic shape is great for fingertip grip
1298	pos	I used the G402 before I upgraded to the G502 and I loved the shape and feel of it and the G502 is pretty much the same shape
1298	pos	I love Logitech peripherals
1298	pos	I own the G402, G502, GPro keyboard, G933 headset, G910 Orion Spark, and the G13 gaming pad
1298	pos	EDIT: I bought another G502 and it was used
1298	pos	The pads in the mouse were worn and peeling off
1298	pos	like wtf
1298	pos	I’m not blaming Logitech for this one, this is all on Amazon
1298	pos	selling used products at full price
1298	pos	shame on you
1299	pos	It's a great mouse
1299	pos	Smooth, accurate, lots of programmable buttons (which as a lite gamer I will probably never use, but my bird very much appreciates their clicky noises)
1299	pos	Also, as someone with a smaller hand, it fits very comfortably
1300	pos	This mouse is hands down the best mouse I have ever had in my life
1300	pos	The rgb is the smoothest and satisfying thing I’ve seen in a gaming product
1300	pos	The buttons feel like they have been worked hard on and the feel of the product in total is outstanding
1300	pos	Also the software to change the sensitivity and the buttons is simple and convenient to use
1300	pos	I definitely would recommend this product
1300	pos	And for the price is unbelievable too see
1300	pos	Best value for a gaming mouse
1301	pos	can't say there is anything  wrong with this mouse, it is absolutely amazing specially if you are a gamer since you can make separate settings for different games
1301	pos	If youre looking at this review before buying all I gotta say is just buy it
1302	neg	I liked the idea of having extra buttons next to my left click
1302	neg	That’s why I bought this mouse originally
1302	neg	I have the Logitech g403 and it feels 100% better then this mouse while gaming
1302	neg	This mouse is extremely heavy (without weights)
1302	neg	I would highly recommend the g403 over this mouse
1302	neg	🚮
1303	pos	Very nice distinct inputs
1303	pos	Extra buttons are in the perfect locations for my hand
1303	pos	Easy to use Logitech ghub software
1304	pos	Generally a good mouse
1304	pos	but had trouble where you have to click the DPS button in order for a right click to register
1304	pos	super annoying
1304	pos	but other than that it is a really good mouse
1305	pos	Overall the G502 is great mouse for gaming and work, it’s fast, light and ergonomic but one of my led stop working
1306	neg	The media could not be loaded
1306	neg	The wheel is so sensitive it will move when moving the mouse too quick or if you pick it up and put it back down
1306	neg	It's so terrible
1307	pos	Heavier than the g pro and ergo shape causes a different grip
1307	pos	Hard to get used to after oval shaped mice for years but def a good product
1308	pos	i love the feeling, the adjustable weights, the customizable lights, but the scroll wheel (even off of frictionless scrolling) scrolls a little longer, i play fortnite a little with this and i use scroll wheel reset, when i do and i go to edit again its still reseting even off of the frictionless scroll wheel setting, overall highly recommend, very satisfied with this
1309	pos	Great mouse, but it drives me crazy sometimes
1309	pos	Every once in awhile it will double click when you single click
1309	pos	It's frustrating, but I understand it's a specific button and that several types of mice use it
1309	pos	Oh, well
1310	pos	Great mouse, I bought it on sale for 40$, I got lucky, very good mouse, I'm not big fan of software mouse however it doesn't take a lot ram or cou usage
1311	pos	This mouse has weights
1311	pos	It's absolutely awesome
1311	pos	If you have big hands this mouse is for you
1311	pos	Definitely an awesome gaming mouse with all sorts of buttons
1312	pos	I will recommend this is the best for FPS gaming
1313	pos	Functionality is great
1313	pos	Not very comfortable after a half hour of gaming
1313	pos	Works well for work, editing, etc
1314	neg	2nd Logitech G502 Hero  same problem as before
1314	neg	After only a month it double clicks 60% of the time
1314	neg	Dont waste time with this mouse
1315	pos	Its an amazing mouse don't get me wrong, and it deserves 5 stars from me, however, the reviews that say you accidentally hit the dpi buttons on the side of the left click, are 100% true
1315	pos	I have gotten better at not doing it, but it still happens occasionally
1316	pos	This is a great mouse for anyone who doesn’t need wireless connectivity
1316	pos	This is probably Logitech’s best gaming wired mouse
1316	pos	One small detail is that on my mouse, one of the LEDs don’t work
1316	pos	Since your hand is covering it most of the time, it’s not a big deal, but I would give 4
1316	pos	5 stars due to 1 LED not working
1316	pos	I also don’t want to return it since this is my only good mouse right now (besides an IBM 1990 ball mouse)
1317	neg	The media could not be loaded
1317	neg	Do not buy this mouse, this is the third one I have gotten, I replaced 2 for the exact same issue
1317	neg	The mouse wheel becomes dislodged very easy and begins to free spin
1317	neg	The same exact issue happened on all three mouses I’ve gotten
1317	neg	Also do not get the asurion protection you do not need it they will just redirect you to Logitech customer service
1318	pos	Great mouse, I look forward to as many years with it as I did with my last Logitech mouse
1319	pos	Fast, swift, fits great, much better than a regular one
1320	pos	After looking at several different types and reviewing them, I decided on this gaming mouse
1320	pos	I have not been disappointed
1320	pos	Fits my grip style (fingertip) perfectly, and the buttons are positioned to where I don't have to move the placement of my hand to get to them
1320	pos	Understand your style of grip before buying a gaming mouse
1320	pos	It makes a difference
1321	pos	This is a good mouse, but the wire is wearing out two weeks after my return window closed
1321	pos	Not very pleased with this
1322	pos	Absolutely adore this mouse
1322	pos	It's popular for good reason
1322	pos	10/10 would buy again

1324	pos	I mostly use this mouse for gaming since I don't want to accidentally break it when I am using it for checking emails
1324	pos	But when I do use it, it is perfect and it molds perfectly with my hand (which is kind of big)
1324	pos	Overall I am very content with this product
1325	neg	I bought this twice and again I have problem - this time around scroll tilt function (left and right) - such that it just doesn’t tilt like my G600
1325	neg	So disappointing
1325	neg	It is embarrassing to even return this back to Amazon
1326	neg	This would’ve been a very good product if description was correct
1326	neg	The description said that the hand orientation was ambidextrous  but this most definitely is only for right handed people
1326	neg	I was kinda sad about this because it really is a good gaming mouse just not as described
1327	pos	Lo compre en descuento y llevo unas semanas usándolo y está perfecto de los mejores mouses que e usado para juegos y diferentes cosas , llegó antes de su fecha y todo en perfecto estado , vino con sus pesas y caja original , y me gusta mucho su cable que viene mallado y no se enreda con facilidad , logré ver mucha diferencia en los juegos
1328	neg	The dpi buttons are in the wrong place ,very bad design  ,this is not a gaming mouse by far , unless you want your mouse moving at Mach 10 across your screen , quality is good  nice feel , and there is no way to disable the dpi buttons
1329	neg	Mouse was fantastic
1329	neg	Super smooth responsive I play on a aluminum mouse pad no issues no spin out the mouse was great
1329	neg	Now I had it for 8 months and now it double clicks
1329	neg	I did everything from dusting to using a different PC everything and logitech has replied to my email
1329	neg	I bought this mouse when it wasn't only 50 bucks I bought it for their 80 dollar price
1329	neg	Not one word from them and it's been weeks
1330	pos	I cant help but like this mouse
1330	pos	A lot
1330	pos	Use all the weights
1330	pos	Pretty lights
1330	pos	Accurate pointer
1330	pos	Get the wired
1331	neg	I keep making this mistake of buying Logitech mice, thinking it won't be so bad this time
1331	neg	They're decent mice, I like the feel of them and such
1331	neg	But they have almost no durability- my last mouse had a double clicking issue within a year, and now this one is either double clicking the right mouse button or doesn't let me hold the button down
1332	neg	When I got it felt nice till I played some games on it
1332	neg	WARNING
1332	neg	The mouse I got would click buttons on its own when I was in game
1332	neg	The scroll wheel in the middle doesn’t have any resistance and will spin way to fast to handle anything and trying to hit flicks on a game are next to impossible, just about everything on the mouse rattles
1332	neg	Highly recommend you do your research on another mouse cause I waisted my money
1332	neg	Multiple friends have had the same issue, so it’s not just once it’s more of a production issue
1333	pos	i dont know why this thing is so cheap
1333	pos	one of the best mice ive ever owned
1333	pos	durable, accurate, no stupid nonsense
1333	pos	just good mousing
1334	neg	The mouse works fine for a little while and then the cursor moves hard to one edge of the screen and then goes unresponsive for a while or jumps and glitches seemingly at random as you move the mouse
1334	neg	I got busy and didn't do the driver / firmware update dance in time to discover that that didn't help, and now it's outside the return window
1335	neg	The right button stopped responding after only a week of use
1336	pos	My son loves it
1336	pos	He claims it the best he's tried
1337	neg	Logitech warranty support not efficient, pretty long and annoying procedure
1338	neg	This is a smooth mouse, with great customization abilities
1338	neg	I don't want to take the time to take apart the mouse in order to adjust the spring that holds the wheel
1338	neg	Only rattles with side to side movements and especially when you are gaming
1338	neg	I don't think it would bother me for everyday use but no way I can game with this mouse
1339	pos	This mouse is the perfect addition to my gaming setup
1339	pos	The light is programmable and easily so, so even a non-techie like myself can change it anytime I wish
1339	pos	It is also extremely comfortable for gaming and everyday use
1339	pos	If you have the money to spend on a higher-end mouse, this is the one to get
1340	pos	my son like it very much
1341	pos	I bought it to replace a G600 that I had for something like 6 years before the left mouse button started having problems where it would doubleclick and drop holds almost instantly
1341	pos	No longer an MMO player, I got the 502 and it lasted 8 months before starting to do the same thing
1341	pos	I like the additional features, but what's the point if the primary one burns out so fast
1342	pos	Love the mouse
1342	pos	Very comfortable and I love the scroll wheel
1342	pos	Would buy again
1342	pos	Some people complain it's too heavy for fps
1342	pos	I don't personally see this as the case, and I do very well playing Call of Duty and Counter-Strike with it
1342	pos	that being said
1342	pos	if you're going for the lightest high end fps mouse on the planet, this is not the mouse you want
1342	pos	I love it, though
1343	neg	I bought it from the seller "Boston Distributors" and have been using it just fine for couple weeks
1343	neg	Unfortunately, it started to have "double click" issue
1343	neg	So when you click once, it double clicks
1343	neg	Sadly, the seller declined the return
1343	neg	Despite some good reviews here, the mouse can break like my case
1343	neg	Avoid this seller and go for possibly other better quality mouse
1344	pos	Got the Logitech G502 Hero 2 wired mouse for some gaming and home office applications
1344	pos	This thing is awesome
1344	pos	The customization is really excellent, but even with default settings it provides a whole new level of ease and comfort
1344	pos	Responsiveness is at the speed of thought
1344	pos	Highly recommended
1345	neg	I bought this seeing a ton of good reviews but when I got it I was extremely disappointed
1345	neg	First off it randomly scrolls which is infuriating and also doesn't scroll when you try to get it to scroll half of the time, second the click buttons are tiny and hard to use for people with large hands
1345	neg	0/10 would not recommend
1346	pos	Great budget mouse
1346	pos	I was on the fence about getting a gaming mouse but after using this one for one month I love it
1346	pos	Don't have to worry about batteries dying like with a wireless mouse
1346	pos	Multiple customization options with the drivers
1347	neg	After only a couple months of using the mouse, the scroll wheel broke and does not allow me to click down with it
1347	neg	Scrolling is good, but I am unhappy with the clicking not working
1348	pos	I had read comments about double clicking and other stuffs，but I brought it for a while and it is still working fine even I drop it for a couple of times
1348	pos	More importantly，it doesnt require me to download a app and then causing some problem when gaming
1349	pos	Love this mouse
1350	pos	It’s so good I don’t even have to say anything about it
1351	pos	I had heard great things about this mouse for years so I decided to give it a shot
1351	pos	The shape is great, but it was just too heavy for my taste
1351	pos	I definitely wouldn’t recommend this for FPS
1351	pos	I ultimately decided to return the mouse due to the mouse scroll wheel having an extreme amount of play side to side and having an audible rattle while sliding
1351	pos	I had read that this has been an issue with recent production, so I guess I was just the unlucky recipient of a bad unit
1352	pos	This was a gift for my adult grandson and he loved it and says its the best gaming mouse that he's ever used
1353	neg	I've had this mouse for less than a year and the left mouse button will send double clicks on its own
1353	neg	At first I thought it was just me not clicking correctly but it's gotten progressively worse over the past few months that the mouse is almost unusable
1353	neg	Time to contact support for an RMA
1353	neg	It would be a 5 star mouse were it not for the clicking issue
1354	pos	I have a glass L-Shaped desk and my previous mouse couldn't work without a mousepad but since the HERO has an improved optical sensor, it works completely with or without one
1355	pos	He said his gaming experience is 100 times better
1356	pos	After 8 months of owning this mouse the double click has made it usable
1356	pos	This mouse cost too much for a 8 month life span
1356	pos	The left click is now useless with zero accuracy
1356	pos	UPDATE Changed my rating from 1 star to 3, logitech replaced the mouse with a new one
1357	pos	My only issue is the scroll wheel isn't dependable as a button
1357	pos	If you want to hotkey up or down that's works fine but actually pressing the scroll wheel wears it out around a hundred uses
1358	pos	I bought this for gaming, I like it
1359	neg	I never leave reviews on Amazon, but this mouse deserves a horrible one
1359	neg	It started the random double clicking after only using it for 8 months
1359	neg	This seems to be a very widespread issue
1359	neg	Hopefully if I contact Logitech they will give me a replacement because this is an expensive mouse to have to replace after only 8 months
1360	pos	I’ve had this mouse for about a year now and it still works as good as the day I got it
1360	pos	It’s overall a great mouse
1360	pos	It feels really good in my hand and I like the fact that you can add weights to it to make it heavier
1361	pos	About 6 months in and I'm starting to notice that the left mouse button will double-click which is really inconvenient in games
1361	pos	It also has issues now with dragging a window
1361	pos	The window goes half-way to its destination and then just dropped off the mouse button
1361	pos	Also had a hell of a time getting the extra buttons to actually work with games to the point I am looking at other options now
1362	pos	Has enough features very fast response if you are lefty then look at one of there other mice as its very right handed
1363	neg	Scroll wheel stopped working after a month and 1 day
1364	neg	The mouse's right-click doesn't work any longer after less than one year of ownership
1364	neg	You wanna play a shooter
1364	neg	Nah you cant aim in
1364	neg	You wanna play an RPG
1364	neg	Nah any right-click is gonna double click and spam 115 times
1365	pos	This mouse is incredibly high quality and isn’t a $300 gimmick
1365	pos	Very affordable and accurate, improved my performance both physically (grip) and mentally (lack of frustration  from horrendous DPI issues)9
1365	pos	8/10
1366	neg	The software to program the buttons doesn’t work unless you have the game you want to play installed on the computer you are using to configure the mouse
1366	neg	It only lets you save the default program which takes up all but 2 of the extra buttons, so I basically only have the two extra buttons on the side and it’s no better than my $10 mouse because I can at least program the buttons on that one
1366	neg	Do not buy Logitech until they get rid of or fix ‘G Hub’
1367	pos	Replaced my horrible Corsair M65 Pro RGB mouse (it had terrible software that would reset your dpi to default if you moved your mouse around quickly) with this great Logitech mouse
1367	pos	Works great with all game types but is exceptional for FPS
1367	pos	For MMO's you have three side buttons to add modifiers Shift, Ctrl and Alt
1367	pos	The software is simple, clean and functional
1367	pos	If I run into any problems I'll update my review
1368	pos	Use this mouse nearly daily and it feels good in my hand no problems
1369	neg	I had been using this mouse for almost 2 years, but a couple of months ago it started to double click randomly, there is no real easy fix to this problem and it was very annoying
1369	neg	I think almost all Logitech mouses have this problem and it is stupid that they have not made a fix
1369	neg	I recently replaced my mouse with a Razer mouse that I like much more
1369	neg	Pros:- Has lots of buttons- Has RGBCons:- Is insanely heave even without all the weights- starts to dubble clink randomly when it gets old
1370	pos	I use the mouse for playing video games, and it works great
1370	pos	My only issues are that I need to fiddle with some of the settings to get the DPI to work how I want, and its a little too latge for my hands meaning two buttons are difficult to reach
1371	pos	I bought this mouse to replace a Zowie EC1-A
1371	pos	After waiting 8 days for delivery, the left click seems to not want to hold
1371	pos	Very disappointing product after waiting over a week
1371	pos	Shame because it fits really well in my hand
1371	pos	I also don't like that you have to have the software open to keep the DPI settings
1371	pos	**Edit: Idk what I did, but for some odd reason, the left click has not been having this problem for months
1371	pos	I'd say it was changing the polling rate, but idk
1372	pos	works great
1372	pos	plenty of programable controls
1373	pos	I upgraded from logitech g402 to g502 hero, and it is totally worth it, I love logitech mouse's and they are my favorite, the mouse is awesome and have smooth movement and it can add weight to it, it even have 11 programmable buttons, no wonder why this is ninja's mouse that he plays fortnite with, for value of money it much better than other junk mouses I have use before
1373	pos	Really you guys should get it and give it a try of never try logitech mouse's, they are the best 💙👌
1374	neg	Expect the switches that drive the left and right buttons to fail after a year
1374	neg	Left click is super squishy
1374	neg	Right click has a high resistance 'snap' or 'crunch' when pressing it
1374	neg	This is not the same Logitech quality I've been relying on for decades
1374	neg	If I wanted to replace my mice every year, I would have just bought a Razer
1375	pos	Replacing my old 502, which still functioned just fine the LED just went out
1375	pos	Lasted 15 years worth every penny
1376	pos	Fav
1376	pos	gaming mouse for the  price
1377	pos	My 15-year-old son loves this mouse
1377	pos	He just built a gaming computer and says this is the one to have
1377	pos	Easy to use
1377	pos	Ergonomic
1377	pos	Price was right
1378	pos	Works well for gaming
1378	pos	The weights that it comes with really help
1379	pos	I have large hands, it feels much different from my last mouse (had it a few years)
1379	pos	Hoping it'll grow on  me
1379	pos	The programming could be simplified a bit for us Boomers that don't take to these things intuitively
1380	neg	The mouse itself is nice design and all and even how it feels in my hand when playing a game
1380	neg	But after only just 2 months of using the mouse the left click started to not work it would double click when i didn't mean to or stutter when i held down left click i don't usually write reviews but this has been a repeated issue with the G502 mice and it's really annoying to have to buy new mice over and over again
1380	neg	3 G502s and never again
1381	neg	Mouse started double clicking after 9 months
1381	neg	I thought I used it kinda lightly
1381	neg	Used mostly for surfing/casual gaming
1381	neg	Seems like it should last longer than that for such a highly rated product
1381	neg	Liked it well enough until the double click issue started
1382	pos	If you're looking for a heavy mouse with rapid left click, this is the corded mouse for you
1382	pos	Was worth it before they dropped the price, but now its a steal
1383	pos	Mouse works great
1383	pos	Nice weight to it, very precise
1383	pos	Buttons easy to program
1384	pos	This is an amazing mouse
1384	pos	I have purchased over 10
1384	pos	Some for me and some for my friends
1384	pos	Truly a perfect product that stands out amongst competitors
1385	pos	As described
1385	pos	Fast shipping
1385	pos	Good pricing
1386	pos	I love the ergonomic design and the look of it
1386	pos	There is only one thing bad about this mouse: the scroll wheel
1387	pos	Feels amazing, I love the extra weight and the metal feeling scroll wheel is my favorite part
1388	pos	but you’re most likely going to accidentally hit the buttons by your thumb during a firefight
1388	pos	Takes some getting used to
1389	pos	I probably will never buy another Razer mouse again
1389	pos	Both of my Naga's broke
1389	pos	One within a year, and one within just months
1389	pos	I really enjoy the RGB so I opted for this
1389	pos	It feels 10x more accurate to me when aiming
1389	pos	The ount of things you can customize is insane
1390	pos	Nice, I can program a couple of key combinations to be button clicks
1391	pos	Great mice
1391	pos	Not to crazy looking like some other brands, also trust worthy company
1391	pos	Will be buying the same mouse if anything happens to this one
1392	pos	The house is great
1392	pos	I'be been using it for online gaming
1392	pos	I definitely recommend getting the logitech software to get the most out of this mouse
1393	pos	i have used Corsair Mouse, Razer Mouse, Other genetic mouses, but all of them had one same issue, Left click always double-clicking after using it for awhile
1393	pos	also i hate the thumb pad style mouse, but this one is different thumb pad does not intrude you in any way used it for about a 6 months now still dont have any double clicking issue, where corsair mouse started double clicking after just mare 2 months
1394	neg	I had the mouse for two weeks before having to return it
1394	neg	Holding the right mouse button would continuously register new clicks, so trying to pan the camera in games would create stutters and general lack of responsiveness
1394	neg	Reading other recent reviews tells me that this is a pretty common issue with this mouse
1395	neg	3rd mouse with the same issue
1395	neg	Two of them arrived with broken scrolling wheel and 3rd broke after two weeks
1395	neg	I'm wondering if they even quality control their products
1396	neg	I thought this was a good mouse and then the thumb button falls off
1396	neg	this is a POS
1397	pos	Great quality, the user interface on their software is extremely easy to use, you can even set up different profiles for different games
1397	pos	The only downside is that this thing is VERY sensitive
1397	pos	If you play any FPS you will want to put all of the weights in the mouse (there’s a nice little cutout on the bottom) to prevent any unnecessary shaking
1398	pos	Todo bien muy buen producto
1399	pos	I first bought this mouse six or seven years ago
1399	pos	Some friends were talking about having to replace their mice because something broke, so I bought a backup
1399	pos	Still using the first one and will untill something goes wrong but it's been almost a decade which states how well these mice hold up
1400	neg	I ordered a new one and got used one
1400	neg	OR BAD Quality Control
1400	neg	The cover piece that cover the Mouse Eye/Weight area look so bad and scratches
1401	neg	Purchased this mouse exclusively for gaming
1401	neg	Overall a nice mouse
1401	neg	A little over a month using it and the double click/not holding the click issue came up like many people have stated in the review section
1401	neg	Wish I would have read more of the reviews before purchasing and not just buying based of the Logitech name
1401	neg	Its not worth the money for such a basic design flaw (as many have had the same exact issue)
1402	neg	The left click button has an intermittent issue that will cause this mouse to fail
1402	neg	Google G502 Left Mouse Button issue before buying this mouse
1403	pos	Love the sensitivity and programing options
1404	pos	Wanted a very responsive mouse that offered 3 programmable buttons on the side that felt naturally accessible for a few select hotkey abilities
1404	pos	Wish the trigger button was touch closer to the back, but overall this ended up being the best fit I found for my claw grip hand
1405	pos	You have to use it to feel the responsive and accurate movement, and with free wheel, best mouse ever used
1406	neg	Unfortunately the mouse came USED not new as it was discribed on the order, The mouse itself is very good and comfortable but its so disappointing that the packaging was bad and the mouse had dust and scratches on the back and it was so clear that it was used by someone else
1407	neg	i dont know if mine is defective but i bought it for gaming - wow/dota2 and randomly mid game the middle mouse button rotates because i moved the mouse down or up
1407	neg	and it causes the camera to go in and out rapidly which makes gaming impossible - i do not recommend this mouse
1408	pos	It was very heavy at first even without the weights, but with it being very smooth it was easy to get used to
1408	pos	The cord was soft so it could be flexed easily without getting tangled everywhere
1408	pos	You basically need to download a software system to edit 99% of the mouse but it only takes a few minutes
1408	pos	Over all very good for the priceL
1409	neg	Received this product and all but one light on the side doesn't work
1409	neg	Very disappointed, the lighting was a big part of why I chose this mouse over others similar
1410	neg	9 months of normal use
1410	neg	< 1 hour per day
1410	neg	Right mouse button starts releasing itself when held down
1410	neg	Gradually it becomes more serious until it stops being useful
1410	neg	Cleaning with wipes and compressed air cannot fix
1410	neg	Left mouse button works great even though it is used a lot more than right mouse button
1410	neg	Suspect cheap design for right mouse button
1410	neg	Do not recommend
1410	neg	Will not buy again
1411	pos	The mouse feels really smooth, and the sides are grippy
1411	pos	The quick DPI changer is very helpful during gaming and the side buttons are nice
1411	pos	I also love how logitech decided to make it without crazy RGB
1411	pos	The only thing i dont like about this mouse is that in the only 2nd day of using the main RGB broke and wont turn on, but thats not a big deal
1412	pos	Started out with an old Logitech mouse for gaming, shopped around and spent alot of money on some other brands, in the end I came back to this one
1412	pos	It's been a solid and reliable choice for me for years and I'm not planning on leaving soon
1412	pos	Highly recommend this one for the price
1413	pos	Long high quality usb cable, ample extra buttons, feels great with included weights added
1413	pos	Perfect for the price for high apm gaming
1414	pos	Great value for the money
1415	neg	Worked for about a month then broke
1415	neg	ordered a new one to replace it and after about a month that one stopped working well also
1415	neg	My $14 trash mouse has lasted a year and works better than this
1415	neg	Just get a Naga mouse
1416	pos	This is a solid mouse, a great replacement for my Corsair M65
1416	pos	One small thing though, I find it hard to reach the sniper DPI button with my thumb, but this could be just a me issue
1416	pos	Besides that, I love it
1416	pos	Definitely worth the price if you’re looking for a upgrade
1417	pos	Great product and I bought another for my granddaughter for her new laptop:)
1418	pos	Great gaming mouse
1418	pos	Super smooth and very easy to set up the rgb controls
1419	pos	The media could not be loaded
1419	pos	Really like the mouse, fits my hand perfectly everything works as should
1419	pos	You can add more weight if u want
1419	pos	Great mouse for the price
1420	neg	This is my second Logitech g502 mouse, the previous being the first iteration, and now the Spectrum
1420	neg	The first mouse lasted around 2 years before the scroll wheel stopped working so I opted for getting this one, the newer version
1420	neg	However, two weeks outside the return period, the Proteus Spectrum left click now double clicks anywhere I press the button
1420	neg	According to articles around the Internet, this has been a problem with Logitech mice for years
1421	neg	1 year 1 month got the click-hold issue not the double click issue
1421	neg	Mouse can't click and hold long enough to drag stuff around
1421	neg	Great mouse otherwise
1422	pos	Favorite mouse ever I dont think I will ever own a different mouse
1423	neg	This mouse is infamous for misclicks
1423	neg	They dont do RMAs either
1423	neg	You have to jump through hundreds of hoops if you want to return this garbage
1423	neg	Never again
1423	neg	Just terrible
1423	neg	Do not waste your money
1424	neg	Had this mouse for 7 months
1424	neg	Did the scroll wheel make some noise when unlocked and moving the mouse sideways
1424	neg	Sure
1424	neg	Did it bother me
1424	neg	No
1424	neg	But both the right and left mouse buttons are not working correctly anymore
1424	neg	Holding either one down is unreliable, I can not even drag windows across my screen
1424	neg	I am searching for solutions, but so far nothing
1425	pos	This has to be the best gaming mouse I have purchased
1425	pos	I used to be a fan of Corsair's but after my wheel broke (no warranty) I decided to try out Logitech's
1425	pos	Feels great, has a great weight to it (i like it on the heavier side)
1425	pos	Looks are awesome too
1425	pos	I like the option of adjusting the wheel, this is a new feature for me and I actually find myself using it from time to time (depends on the game)
1425	pos	If you're debating on purchasing this mouse, I highly suggest you do
1426	neg	I have bought two of theses mice because I thought it must be a fluke
1426	neg	after falling off the desk the middle button started randomly clicking when scrolling and scrolling would skip lines or not work
1426	neg	Love the concept wish it was made with quality materials
1427	pos	Great build quality and multiple options available to configure the sensitivity, colors and weight distribution
1427	pos	Note that the mouse scroll has a release button that makes it work like a flywheel for easy srolling
1427	pos	Install the G-Hub control panel to customize the mouse button / colors etc
1428	pos	For gaming, having quick access to DPI setting is a blessing
1428	pos	Has several weights to find your perfect resistance
1428	pos	I also use it in for data entry, the scroll wheel unlocks and you can flick it to quickly scroll documents
1428	pos	This helps extremely when you are entering data and need to refer to the top of the page for information or even quickly returning to the top of a web page
1429	pos	I ordered this mouse since it claimed to be ambidextrous
1429	pos	I ordered it and it came, the mouse is super comfortable on my right hand but terrible on my left
1429	pos	I could order a left-handed mouse but the DPI would be less and not as comfortable
1430	pos	I have two of these going at home and at work - bought this one as a spare - still in the box
1430	pos	The other two have been going flawlessly for 3 years plus
1430	pos	On sale, the best value gaming mouse on the planet, hands down
1430	pos	It's got a snipey button too
1431	pos	After buying this mouse I will never change to anything else, the scroll feature is amazing on this item as well
1432	pos	Excellent mouse
1433	pos	Best wired gaming mouse imho
1433	pos	The rgb is a plus
1433	pos	Although, it's starting to do x2 clicking
1434	pos	I have been using this mouse for like 2-3 months now and it been hurting my wrists playing with it
1434	pos	Anyway I try to grab the mouse feels weird and it gives me a burning like sensation in my hand while trying to use it
1434	pos	But I am forced to use it since my old mouse broke
1434	pos	So if you have small hands don’t buy this
1435	pos	I love this mouse
1435	pos	I love the fact that I can change the dpi with just one click
1435	pos	It makes switching contexts super nifty
1435	pos	It's quality is great and the tracking is really good
1435	pos	I highly recommend it
1436	pos	By far the best mous I have used
1436	pos	Free wheel excellent feature
1436	pos	Quick response
1437	pos	Using it for CAD operation
1438	pos	Fantastic, comfortable, responsive
1438	pos	I also love the button that turns on and off the mouse wheel gears
1439	pos	Lo compre para un amigo como regalo y siempre me dice que es el mejor que ha tenido
1440	pos	a bit pricey, but deffinetly worth it
1440	pos	i love it
1441	neg	It was a great mouse up until the laser stopped working right
1441	neg	Mouse mat or no and just randomly decides to fly off wherever after a few minutes
1441	neg	Really disappointing
1442	pos	Everything about this mouse is great
1442	pos	I definitely recommend this mouse to anyone who games especially with the adjustable weights
1442	pos	Fits great on my big hand and the free scroll wheel toggle is awesome
1442	pos	The only thing is that the three primary lights on top of the logo are not working and haven't worked since i got the mouse about a month ago, even with the Logitech G Hub software which is great
1442	pos	However, I do not really mind since the performance is excellent
1443	neg	I hate to write this review
1443	neg	I loved this mouse, but lately it is not usable for gaming
1443	neg	The switch in the right mouse button is faulty
1443	neg	In most shooters the right mouse button is aim down sight
1443	neg	While holding down the RMB it flickers causing me to pull out of sights unexpectedly
1443	neg	I really expected better switches out of such a reputable mouse
1444	neg	It was a pretty good mouse
1444	neg	Compared to other Logitech mice, I thought this one was price well for its quality
1444	neg	Well, I guess I was wrong
1444	neg	The mouse started to double click and now it's gotten worse
1444	neg	Super annoying to try to play FPS games with it
1444	neg	I hope to get a replacement for it soon
1445	pos	It's a solid mouse for gaming
1445	pos	The only complaint is how heavy it is compared to other options out there
1446	neg	Not a fan of buying “gamer” products, but this was was just plain broken because of the over engineering that went into the mouse wheel (MB3)
1447	pos	After 6 months of use, the mouse is double clicking
1447	pos	It seems like a reoccurring problem in newer gaming mice
1447	pos	As this mouse was replacing a Razer mouse that started doing the same thing after 1 1/2 years of use
1447	pos	I'm really disappointed in the quality of the mouse
1448	pos	It is Very comfortable in my hand for a long gaming session, and with the adjustable weights it can be the perfect mouse for any gamer
1448	pos	The only problem I can think of is that LGHUB is not the easiest thing to use and was very outputting for me at first
1449	pos	For the price its awesome
1449	pos	I know a lot of you don't like wired mice but I think they are more reliable and longer lasting
1450	pos	This is the best mouse i’ve come in contact with
1450	pos	Everything about it is perfect
1450	pos	If you’re thinking about buying this mouse, you very well should
1450	pos	If you’re thinking about buying this for your child, you should
1450	pos	They will love you even more
1451	neg	Logitech gaming software doesn't support thisYou have to download the hug and it's annoying as heck to use
1452	pos	Bueno
1453	pos	LOVE this mouse
1453	pos	Had the older version and was gonna order it again for another computer
1453	pos	Amazon recommend this newer version and OH MY GEEE I love it
1454	pos	The mouse is perfect for windows games
1454	pos	The mouse wheel is notched, so you get excellent control over scrolling
1454	pos	Very important when changing weapons quickly
1454	pos	The mouse can also be weighted
1454	pos	I found that this feature made the tracking on the mouse pad more precise as well
1454	pos	Definitely worth the money
1455	pos	Logitech is a great brand so hardly ever do they get it wrong and this mouse is no exception
1455	pos	The comfort and style of the mouse are awesome
1455	pos	The ability to adjust the weights underneath the mouse make it great for each individual user
1455	pos	100x over again I would purchase this mouse
1455	pos	The one big con I have is that the mouse cord attracts dust
1456	pos	Everything I wanted and more in a mouse for a great price
1457	pos	The media could not be loaded
1457	pos	Es buen ratón la verdad si lo recomiendo para jugar ya que los botones extra son de bastante ayuda no solo para juegos si no para la escuela tener accesos rápidos etc y es bastante bueno si lo encuentran en oferta yo si lo recomiendo la verdad
1458	pos	Excelente inversión me gusto mucho y lo recomiendo mucho
1459	pos	Es un mouse excelente, calidad de los botones, comodidad y todo al 100, recomendado
1460	neg	Bought it because it was suppose to be good for bigger hands
1460	neg	Was way smaller then my previous mouse
1460	neg	If you have tiny hands; 1) feel bad for you 2)mouse is perfect for you
1461	neg	Wheel is loose and useless
1462	neg	Left-Click broke within 30 days of owning it
1462	neg	It double-clicks when i single-click, and can no longer hold down left-click
1462	neg	Over the years I have purchased 3 different mice, a keyboard and speakers from Logitech, and I have never seen such a horrible product shipped by them
1463	pos	I ended up cancelling to buy in-store because it was going to take too long to ship, but it is the gaming mouse for a reason
1463	pos	RGB is a nice touch, but the adjustable weight, the infinite-scroll, and high dpi sets it apart from the rest
1463	pos	Just get the mouse, man
1464	pos	I have used very basic mice in the past and this was a HUGE step up
1464	pos	For gaming, it's very responsive
1464	pos	I also use with design programs and the extra buttons are great for that
1464	pos	The only warning I would give is that it seems like it is better for palm grip
1465	pos	I honestly don't know if I get a different brand again
1466	pos	I used to use Razer deathadder for long but switched to g502
1466	pos	Got it with $40
1466	pos	No matter the wheel, button and the functionalities, it should be the best I have ever tried
1466	pos	Suggested
1467	neg	Decided to go with Logitech after being a Deathadder fan for quite some time
1467	neg	I had become unsatisfied with the build quality of Razer lately so I went with this Logitech mouse
1467	neg	After just 5 months the right mouse click has begun to flicker on and off when holding down the click
1467	neg	Making ADS impossible in all games
1467	neg	I would have been better off with the Razer, the Death adders I have owned lasted much longer
1467	neg	Don't buy Razor or Logitech overall quality has degraded significantly over the years
1468	pos	Replaced the Corsair Scimitar with this mouse
1468	pos	I love it so much more
1468	pos	I love all of the extra functions this controller has that most other mice do not have
1468	pos	(Scroll wheel tilt and smaller programmable "edge-clicker" buttons on the left side
1469	pos	All controls are easy to use with out moving more than a digit, so you are always in control
1470	pos	Very pleased with this purchase and worth every penny
1470	pos	I highly advise buying this
1471	neg	Garbage
1471	neg	Its one sale point was that it worked on any surface
1471	neg	Was DOA and factory new
1471	neg	Tech support was useless and when I sent it in for a return, I never got my money back, but for some reason the package got returned
1471	neg	Now I have an ugly paperweight
1471	neg	And I'm out of some money
1472	pos	Great feel and balance
1472	pos	Very glad I went with this mouse after trying quite a few

1473	pos	heh
1473	pos	gaming mouse go brrrr
1474	neg	This mouse is trash for the price
1474	neg	Scroll wheel flies continuously as opposed to locking in a groove so scroll bars don’t go flying
1474	neg	Mouse clicks don’t register around 1/10 the time and is pretty flimsy
1474	neg	Pretty disappointed for a $50 mouse
1475	pos	So I originally ordered the mouse to upgrade because my G602(high recommend) was a few years old
1475	pos	It’s well made, and it feels right
1475	pos	I am one to really utilize my mouse for hotkeys, and all I can say is the placement for these keys on the 502 are horrible
1475	pos	Not ideal at all compared to the 602
1476	pos	The only pseudo complaint is the lighting software didn’t give well with the Asus Aura from my MOBO, but that is just as likely an Asus issue
1477	neg	Liked the older G502 as it was nice, durable and lasted quite a long time
1477	neg	I decided to get the hero because of it and that was a mistake
1477	neg	Two months into the purchase and the mouse started having issues with its left click button to where I can't drag and drop stuff
1477	neg	Other mouses I have do the drag and drop without a problem, but it seems like the product is not as durable as its predecessor
1477	neg	Since I can't return it as it failed a month after the last return date, I'm going to leave a warning to people about this product
1478	pos	Overall just a great mouse it’s infinite scroll wheel and the ability to change the dpi are amazing the one downfall of this mouse is that it can’t double click because it has some internal cap that limits the amount of cps  (clicks per second) you can get if it wasn’t for this this would be the best mouse aside with its side buttons
1479	pos	I like the software associated with the device as well as the build quality
1480	pos	So after about a year the double click issue popped up
1480	pos	Still bought another one knowing it will do it again because it's still the best and only $40
1481	pos	Ergonomics are great on the mouse
1481	pos	But the software constantly loses the manual settings and has to be recalibrated again
1482	pos	Lots of features more than I actually needed but the I have to say this mouse is of very good quality and very precise good feel to my hand
1482	pos	I like the fact that I can change the weight for different applications
1483	pos	Last one lasted five years of pretty intense gaming and multiple users, nuff said
1484	pos	Es el mejor raton que he tenido hasta el momento, es ideal para cualquier tipo de mano y cumple con todas las espectativas, lo único malo si se podría decir así es el configurarlo con su propia aplicación de Logitech porque es muy poco intuitiva, pero de resto es 100% recomendable
1485	pos	Great mouse for working from home
1486	pos	The G502 is famous for being a great gaming mouse for only 40 dollars
1486	pos	I am not blown away by it's performance, but I am also in no way disappointed either
1486	pos	Great build, and Logitechs software is much better than other brands like Razer
1487	pos	Been using this mouse for about 4 months
1487	pos	Still feels new as the first day and I use it for almost 6hrs a day everyday
1487	pos	No complaints
1488	neg	There are two things that a computer mouse is required to do - move the pointer, and click
1488	neg	This mouse can only do one of those things correctly
1488	neg	Do not buy it
1489	pos	I have been looking at this mouse for a while and heard great things about it
1489	pos	As soon as I saw it on sale I took the opportunity to get it
1489	pos	Although the mouse is fully functional I found out that the gliding pads were to shallow for my mousepad therefore making it feel like dragging sandpaper across my desk
1489	pos	Other than that I can't complain but will continue to use my Corsair m65 as my main
1490	neg	This thing barely made it three months before dying so hard my PC wouldn't boot with it plugged in
1490	neg	Support took 3 days to reply to my email with a form letter asking them to email back with the same details from my original email
1491	pos	“100/100” from my son says it’s the best mouse for gaming
1491	pos	Highly recommends
1492	neg	EDIT: changing my review to 1 star because this mouse broke after 8 months of consistent use (started randomly clicking)
1493	neg	Couldn't get it to work with any of my games
1494	pos	This Mouse was great for about 3 or 4 months when I noticed that the left mouse button would stop inputting randomly
1494	pos	I really noticed when shooting in games like Overwatch
1494	pos	I would have to click several times to do anything
1494	pos	It was great until then
1494	pos	Hopefully Logitech will help me with getting a replacement
1494	pos	But otherwise it worked fine
1494	pos	Just wanted to let everyone know of the issue I had
1495	pos	I’ve been one of those people who said a mouse is a mouse as long as it moves the pointer I am good but I have never been more comfortable with a mouse than this oneWith a mouse pad it feels so smooth to move the mouse I really like it
1496	neg	Great mouse in theory but I've been through 3 of them now and every time the click buttons break
1496	neg	they definitely did not make these to last longer than 1 year
1496	neg	Disappointing
1497	pos	I got this product a month ago January 15th and have loved every second
1497	pos	People said it was heavy but i ended up putting all the weights in because i dont think its that heavy
1497	pos	In total good product
1497	pos	10/10
1498	pos	Funciona a la perfección
1499	neg	Utterly trash software and you can’t even change the dpi the slider of it it’s never on point
1499	neg	I have it way to my cousins day after I got it
1499	neg	Razor supreme
1500	pos	We love our apple products, but the mouse was so hard to use
1500	pos	We replaced the apple mouse with this one and we are thrilled
1500	pos	So nice and my son loves it for gaming
1501	pos	I've been using this mouse for a year now, I love everything about it
1501	pos	The only thing I would change about this mouse is an extra button or two and increase the size a little
1501	pos	The price for this mouse is absolutely fantastic and makes it worth buying it 100%
1502	pos	This mouse was the best mouse that I ever used
1502	pos	So comfortable in the hand and it had many aspects that will give you the best experience
1502	pos	The only problem is that in about 1 year the mouses left button will become an issue
1502	pos	Sometimes it will not respond when you use it
1502	pos	But other than that Logitech is the best brand from mouses keyboards and headsets
1503	pos	I love this mouse
1503	pos	I use it for work and gaming
1503	pos	Only issue I have with it is that I'll accidentally hit the mode switch and have to cycle back to the correct mode for whatever I'm doing
1503	pos	But besides that it's great
1503	pos	I work in imaging and having the ability to unlock the wheel is a huge plus
1503	pos	For gaming it has just enough buttons for my MMOs
1503	pos	They are placed just right in the mouse for use
1503	pos	Also being able to adjust the weight helps a lot for more precise gaming like fps
1504	neg	The right click is failing to respond when pressed, it is hit or miss if it will activate upon clicking
1505	pos	I wasn't sure if this was a good purchase as I wasn't too sure if buying a better mouse would make a difference
1505	pos	Honestly this mouse is beyond amazing
1505	pos	I had a 10 dollar gaming mouse before this and this is a massive step up
1505	pos	The tracking of the mouse is amazing, the size and shape are perfect
1505	pos	The weight is also not an issue which is one thing I considered alot when picking out the new mouse
1505	pos	It feels smooth and precise in whatever I am doing on my pc
1506	neg	Wouldn't work without proprietary software (never mentioned, support team told me about it) and this week they pushed an update
1506	neg	when they did, peripherals stopped working
1506	neg	Had to stop the machine which is an active server, with upset clients, all because I need updated proprietary software just to operate a mouse
1507	pos	If you plan to use it for gaming
1507	pos	Pass
1507	pos	The mouse wheel is hard plastic and has zero grip to your finger
1507	pos	As a day in day out mouse it is even aggravating it’s so slick
1508	neg	Great mouse but my scroll wheel just quit working
1508	neg	No it's not the locked scroll wheel
1508	neg	I physically can't scroll after owning it for not even two years
1508	neg	Not the first time it's happened
1508	neg	Wouldn't recommend based on this
1509	pos	This mouse is easy to set up and fits your hand perfectly
1509	pos	No slipping off the mouse or reposition needed
1509	pos	Also the rgb is nice without being distracting
1509	pos	Definitely worth the money
1510	pos	Overall, i love the mouse
1510	pos	BUT, after not even using it that long, the left click sometimes isn't responding to my click
1510	pos	Which sucks since my main game i play is Rainbow Six Siege
1511	pos	such a nice mouse
1511	pos	haven’t had any problems all the buttons are nice
1511	pos	the weights are awesome
1511	pos	the dpi pre sets are awesome
1511	pos	everything about this mouse is just amazing
1511	pos	no matter what level of gaming or just office work you’re doing this mouse is for you
1512	pos	The shape of this mouse is everything
1512	pos	Not the actual look of it (which is fine anyway) but the feel of it is great because it fits in my small hands perfectly
1512	pos	At first, I was a little skeptical about this mouse because the scroll wheel is so loose, but I warmed up to it in a few hours
1513	pos	Bought this a while ago on recommendation from a friend
1514	pos	Love how it feels and with the app there's a wide variety of settings for it
1514	pos	Definitely happy with my purchased and I've had it for over a month now
1515	pos	I got this mouse as an upgrade to my Razer deathadder which was on it's last legs and this mouse is awesome
1515	pos	The ability to add weights is great, you can rebind all of the buttons, and it's very ergonomic
1515	pos	Worth the price
1516	pos	Would totally recommend it, the sensor is really good, great build quality and it's confortable to use for many hours, the cable is not heavy at all and all the extra buttons come in handy in almost every game for shortcuts
1517	neg	My mouse clicks 2 times for ever 1 click on the left button
1517	neg	This makes it pretty much unusable
1517	neg	I tried contacting logitech but they just gave me a standard email to try a million things software related
1517	neg	It's definitely a mechanical issue
1517	neg	Broke after a couple months of ordering it
1518	pos	My teen son loves this mouse for gaming, specially for playing Minecraft
1518	pos	It was the only affordable option, so I’m pleased with the quality given the cost
1519	pos	Logitech mouses are notorious
1519	pos	Ive loved every logi mouse I have got and have never had problems
1519	pos	Thats why I stay will logi and don't buy Corsair or other brands because logi always works no matter what
1520	pos	Now I know why my friend kept calling it the best mouse for gaming, haha
1521	pos	Lets see how long this one lasts
1522	pos	If you're like me, you're looking to get into PC gaming and your head is spinning with all the different options and "top ten" lists from tech websites and you just want something that guaranteed to be all that you need without breaking the bank
1522	pos	This is it
1522	pos	There's an entire subreddit dedicated to how great this mouse is
1522	pos	There's not a whole lot else to say
1523	pos	Very Ergonomic Mice for Gaming
1524	pos	The mouse is great and the downloadable software support is amazing
1524	pos	I personally just wish the mouse was slightly wider in size
1524	pos	I however have enormous hands
1524	pos	The buttons are extremely handy
1525	neg	I bought this mouse in March, and played COD for 3 month, and then it's defected, primary click can't hold, means I can't shot anymore
1525	neg	Very pool quality
1526	pos	I've ordered this product before
1526	pos	Last time, the cord had a kink in it that resulted in the writing getting messed up
1526	pos	This time, however, it's in perfect condition
1526	pos	Great mouse
1527	pos	My brother loved it
1527	pos	Used it for his gaming
1528	neg	Buttons stopped working well and the clicks were super annoying
1528	neg	The design does look cool in the picture but in reality when you get a good view it does look a bit weird
1529	neg	Bought this mouse to hopefully end a cycle of replacing cheap mice with other cheap mice that wear out just as fast, but this mouse failed even faster
1529	neg	That alone makes this mouse impossible to recommend, but it's also uncomfortable to hold
1529	neg	If there's a mouse that's worth spending more money on, it's not this one
1530	pos	I really like this mouse
1530	pos	The additional buttons allow for a bunch of options, and the software that you download for it makes it really easy to customize it to how I play
1530	pos	Also, the per-game/program custom settings make it really easy to have different profiles for whatever you're doing
1530	pos	I even used it for excel spreadsheets and miss having it at work
1531	pos	Best gaming mouse ever
1531	pos	So smooth
1532	pos	This mouse is smooth, responsive and feels great
1532	pos	I recommend it
1533	pos	Awesome mouse, love the side buttons and the ability to change the speed In game
1534	pos	Was a very nice upgrade
1535	pos	Ive had the same base model of this mouse for many many years
1535	pos	This one is just not as good
1535	pos	The side to side mouse button (which i use a lot) is way way to sensitive and trigger way way way to easily
1536	neg	works well
1536	neg	fits my hand really nicely
1536	neg	But it's just way too heavy
1537	pos	I now have two of these mice, one I game with and one I use for work
1537	pos	They are reliable (Had one for a year now and other one for a month or so) smooth, and easy to hold in your hand
1537	pos	I definitely recommend it for any use; work, gaming, school, etc
1537	pos	10/10 great product
1538	pos	Perfect love ir
1539	pos	Great mouse for everyday work of gaming
1539	pos	My teenage son is very happy
1539	pos	This will last long time, better spend money to get good quality than keep buying cheap product
1540	pos	perfect except the buttons on the side bump SOOOO easily and close videos and crap on me all the time
1541	pos	Best mouse I have ever had
1541	pos	Fully customizable with the g hub app
1541	pos	DPI settings are great and the customizable buttons on the mouse are perfectly placed
1541	pos	I like somewhat heavier mice and this feels great
1542	neg	how this mouse got over 4 stars rating
1542	neg	this is A junk
1542	neg	dont buy
1542	neg	i dont understand who made it, but how come they put left click and dpi button are in the same spot loli dont who design, but i am so sure this is very very not gooddont buyand they said i can custom button function hahahow nice answer
1543	neg	I got this around 8 months ago and the left click sometimes doesn't work and sometimes it double clicks really fast, my razor last like 3+ years everything else it's fine but durability is not one of them
1544	pos	Finally had to replace my old G502 after over 7 years, one button finally failedI got an extra one just to keep in my closet if I ever need another
1545	pos	The mouse worked perfectly up until recently, one of the side buttons and the left mouse click have been getting stuck and are having issues holding
1545	pos	I use these buttons on a daily basis so it makes sense that they’ve stopped working properly but I’d hoped it would have lasted a bit longer
1546	pos	Good
1547	pos	Perfectly built for beginner gamers
1547	pos	I bought thiss cause every wireless mouse I bought had a lag
1547	pos	This turned out great
1547	pos	If you’re a fan of lighter mice this might not be the option for you because this is known to be the hefty one among the pro gamers
1548	pos	I really like this mouse I like it's feel and how customizable it is in terms of weight
1548	pos	The rgb G logo is a nice touch and the software for the mouse it also very good
1549	pos	Excellent gaming mouse for a very, very VERY good price
1549	pos	I almost don't notice the cord when gaming 10/10GHub Works well, anyone how's saying otherwise needs to take a little bit of time to learn how to use it
1550	pos	I have already owned the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, so the upgrade to the G502 Hero was an easy choice for me
1550	pos	Ergonomically, I wish the right side of the mouse was a bit wider so that my pink is't constantly hanging off
1550	pos	The better DPI and improved optical sensors do seem noticeable to me
1550	pos	My biggest issue with this purchase was that the product came clearly repackaged
1550	pos	I was expecting a brand new, unwrapped product but this product has clear signs of use
1551	pos	Great mouse
1551	pos	Good dpi settings and very smooth scrolling
1551	pos	Software for this is great uses very little resources
1551	pos	Only gripe is the mouse wheel feel; it feels spongy
1552	pos	I like how this product has tons of extra macros buttons to press, perfect for creating hot keys and for gaming
1552	pos	First one broke due to my own error but this mouse is very nice, a great gaming mouse and is still good for browsing
1552	pos	The one thing I dislike is how easy the macro buttons can be bumped, not a big deal just a little annoying at times
1553	pos	The only downside I have to this product is the button behind the scroll wheel
1553	pos	It is far too sensitive and makes accidental bumps a common occurrence
1553	pos	Otherwise this is by far the best mouse I have ever owned
1553	pos	Absolutely love it
1554	pos	Great mouse for gaming
1554	pos	Good quality
1555	pos	It's a mouse that is reliable and functions well
1555	pos	What else is there to say
1556	pos	a clever mouse，But I returned it because it's not work well with MacBook
1556	pos	the introduction should mention that
1557	pos	Logitech is elite
1557	pos	This mouse is no different
1557	pos	Not only is great in gameplay but the feel and use is superb
1557	pos	Kudos to Logitech for a great product
1558	pos	I keep destroying kids on Xbox with this mouse so they keep insulting me so I just cry every time I play with this
1559	pos	Love the extra weight that can be added
1559	pos	I usually play sniper or other builds that require a great deal of accuracy
1559	pos	Being able to add the weight to the mouse makes it much 'slower', which considerably improves accuracy
1559	pos	Love it
1559	pos	That said, logitechs gaming software kinda sucks balls, so -1 star for that
1560	pos	I went from the razor naga 2014 to this because I wanted to change it up
1560	pos	I’ve been using it for world of Warcraft for a year now
1560	pos	Easy to set up and very comfortable
1560	pos	All buttons work with shift modifiers
1561	pos	It's a great mouse, the only thing I don't like about it is that the smooth scrolling button is too sensitive
1562	neg	It was a great mouse for about 6 months, and then it started double clicking during games and getting me killed
1563	pos	I've been through many of these
1563	pos	You get 1-2 drops from the desk before it malfunctions or is completely unusable
1564	pos	Really cool, Has a bunch of buttons
1564	pos	You can push the scroll wheel to different sides as buttons and you can change its settings to free-scroll by clicking a button right next to it, Has a bunch of colors, comes with weighs you can pop in to make the mouse heavier if you want
1564	pos	Worth every penny
1565	neg	left clicker wore out really quickly
1565	neg	middle mouse wheel can spin but it only registers it for a brief moment and then stops while wheel is still spinning
1566	pos	This mouse is very comfortable to hold
1566	pos	Easy to reach specialty buttons, removable weights to change how heavy it is, and a nice ball bearing mouse wheel feature to allow a non-stop roll with just one swift swipe down
1567	neg	Those saying that Logitech quality has fallen off are absolutely right
1567	neg	I'm a relatively heavy computer user
1567	neg	In the past I've had the G303, the M500, and various other mice in the $15-$40 range
1567	neg	They normally last 14-18 months; even the $15 cheapy from Walmart
1567	neg	Paid almost $55 for this one and in 4 months the buttons are randomly not clicking, double clicking, and letting go halfway through a drag
1567	neg	Very disappointing
1567	neg	Don't waste your money
1568	pos	My son told me that his Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB gaming mouse would not scroll
1568	pos	He asked for a new mouse
1568	pos	This Logitech G502 was not the same as what he had
1568	pos	It is better
1568	pos	He likes it a lot more than his previous mouse
1568	pos	I use Logitech peripherals and figured it would be a good choice for his gaming needs
1569	neg	Trash mouse with trash double click problem after 5 months just like trash razer mice, so annoying
1570	pos	The mouse is bound to fail there is a know issue with the switches they use
1570	pos	mine failed after 1 and a half years
1571	pos	Great mouse for the price
1571	pos	This is my second G502 hero now
1571	pos	Only issue I had
1571	pos	The slides went bad on my first one after a year of use
1571	pos	And my second one the slides went bad after one month
1571	pos	I had to buy after market slides to fix the mouse and now it works great
1572	pos	Our son needed a new mouse for gaming and he said he loves this one
1573	pos	Excellent product
1574	pos	The scroll wheel is pretty rough and feels kinda had
1574	pos	Everything else is fantastic
1574	pos	The cord is great
1575	neg	Macros containing Ctrl, Alt, or Shift will not work with on-board memory
1575	neg	It's a known bug and Logitech hasn't done anything for months to address it
1575	neg	Edit: You can get it to work if you use their older software
1576	pos	I have 5 of these at home
1576	pos	They are great and I like the weight of them and how easily they glide
1576	pos	Very responsive and the programmable buttons do what I need them for
1576	pos	Great mouse for sure
1577	pos	is all you got to worry about watch that driver software
1578	pos	Very nice looking and works great just a great item overall
1579	pos	I ordered this a while ago in the second half of 2019
1579	pos	Just this last week, I was no longer able to hold right-click
1579	pos	It ended up thinking I was pressing it really fast instead of holding it
1579	pos	It also seems that this is a recurring problem for this specific mouse
1579	pos	I hope it gets fixed soon cause it is otherwise an excellent mouse
1580	neg	It was great for the first week but then the scroll wheel stopped working
1581	pos	Pretty happy with it
1581	pos	Replaced my previous G series mouse from years ago
1581	pos	Weight is shifted more towards the middle
1581	pos	The fabric cord has very little drag
1581	pos	If you're familiar with the g series line, it's definitely the high end of that wheel house
1582	pos	Click* spinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnIt works good for high level comp FPS games too I guess
1583	pos	I use this for gaming and it's just a solid all around mouse
1583	pos	Software to customize the dpi is easy fits in my hand nicely and custom weighting it really nice
1584	pos	I bought the mouse in February, and I expected it to last about another two years, as my last Logitech mouse did
1584	pos	But I was experiencing problems with the right click button in less than 6 months
1584	pos	I tried to buy my old mouse but it was unavailable
1584	pos	Don't buy this mouse
1585	pos	My new favorite mouse
1585	pos	Fits my hand great and has a customizable weight
1585	pos	All the buttons you could want and you can easily customize it with the software
1586	pos	Works good
1586	pos	Good for gaming and daily use
1587	pos	Using it now; No complaints
1588	pos	Been using it ever sence I got and seems to be working fine so far
1589	neg	My LMB does not register while being held down
1589	neg	It will click once, but when attempting to drag an item across my desktop, or dragging a screen, it requires several clicks and short drags
1589	neg	Would not buy again
1590	pos	It was a gift for my grandson and he loves it
1591	pos	Excelente calidad precio, recomendado
1592	pos	Best mouse I've ever used, the overall feel is great
1592	pos	The thumb rest makes moving the mouse feel effortless
1592	pos	This mouse glides very smooth across the insignia mouse pad I use
1592	pos	Nice and lightweight
1592	pos	I just bought a second one for an additional computer
1592	pos	I hope Logitech never stops making this model
1593	pos	After buying a few different mice, none of them compare to this one
1593	pos	I absolutely love it
1594	pos	It was easy to hold and slide on pad
1595	pos	Best mouse you can get for the price
1595	pos	It's got the looks and a nice feel when gaming, but I would say it's for people with bigger hands so it may not be for everyone
1596	pos	I’ve used this mouse for a very long time and the extra buttons always come in handy, and the quick dpi as well as the spinning wheel are very useful
1597	pos	Was great while it lasted but the left and right buttons just stopped working after about 6 months of use
1598	pos	MY SON LOVE IT, GIFT
1599	pos	Absolutely my favorite mouse I've ever used
1599	pos	Using all the weights feels great for gaming and work
1599	pos	Extreme customization options, great paired with G910 keyboard 👍
1600	neg	It's just not comfortable
1600	neg	I've used many mouses since the 90s and this is one of the least comfortable I've touched
1600	neg	You can't easily do the lift, it doesn't work well on many surfaces
1600	neg	Just a bad mouse all around
1601	pos	Love the mouse its actually my second one I had bought first one just died was less then 1 month old and had no damage it just died
1601	pos	But amazon reps were great and offered me a refund which I used to purchase a replacement and it has been great
1601	pos	Mouse feels great and Logitech seems to have pretty good software
1602	neg	Mouse didn't last very long
1602	neg	The majority of mice I've used have lasted me more than 2 years
1602	neg	As for this one, problems arose not even 3 months later
1602	neg	The mouse was giving me problems such as double clicking, not clicking, and getting stuck
1602	neg	The mouse finally gave out, and the left mouse button broke off and is completely unusable
1602	neg	Unfortunate, given the marketing of the mouse and what it's mean to do
1602	neg	It was perfect until 3 months later
1603	pos	It took me about one week to finally settle on a mouse which was the G502 Hero
1603	pos	So I bought it as soon as I could, I must say it is great
1603	pos	Just the way it fits in my hand it couldn't be more perfect
1603	pos	One thing about buying it is when I opened the package I ended up getting the G502 SE Hero
1603	pos	Which is the version of it that has a silver scroll wheel and white strips on the mouse
1603	pos	Even though it was a mistake I'm happier with the SE because it looks great
1604	pos	Ive had this mouse for almost two years, and I've had very few issues until recently
1604	pos	The mouse has started double-clicking (2 clicks for the price of one)
1604	pos	This is pretty disappointing since Logitech is known for its longevity, and I'm well past the return period
1604	pos	A great mouse, but when it goes downhill, it does it in a very noticeable way
1605	pos	This is good for my son to use, it is very sensitive
1605	pos	He likes it very much
1606	pos	This is my second G502 mouse the first one lasted for many years and worked great
1607	pos	The mouse works amazing, great sensor and too quality software
1607	pos	My recommendation is to buy it only from Amazon, I bought one from an associate and they sent me something used so be careful
1608	pos	I can't give this mouse less than 5 stars
1608	pos	Although I personally ended up changing to a lightweight mouse, the G502 it's great for gamers
1608	pos	If you play fps with low dpi though, stick with a lightweight mouse, your wrists will thank you
1609	pos	Really good mouse
1609	pos	My only issues with them have been the wheele gives out a bit to easy
1610	pos	the mouse works perfectly, it is super sensitive, its software is very user friendly and the weights make it really comfortable
1611	neg	every single button on the mouse (left, right, middle, and all of the side buttons) started to double/triple click on a single press after a couple months of use
1611	neg	customer support and the warranty i got were entirely useless, so now I just have a broken brick of a mouse that i can't return/replace or use
1611	neg	nice
1612	pos	Good mouse for price
1613	neg	This mouse has a sleek design that fits in my hand nicely
1613	neg	The mouse works awesome and the customizability with the Logitech software is amazing
1613	neg	However, a major issue that I have with the mouse is it randomly disconnects when I’m using it
1613	neg	This issue really bumps down the rating because what good is a mouse design if the functionality is not there
1613	neg	I’ve used it on a several laptops and computers, and the issue still occurs
1613	neg	Not sure what’s wrong with the mouse
1614	neg	This mouse started having double click issues and issues with not being able to drag and drop items after about one month randomly, as time went on it became consistent
1614	neg	Now I'll have to attempt to get ahold of Logitech for an RMA replacement, this is a huge waste of time, and I've had to go buy a cheap Walmart mouse just to get by in the interim
1614	neg	😠
1615	pos	I would prefer they had a little finger rest as my hand gets tired holding it up during lengthy sessions
1615	pos	The buttons are responsive
1615	pos	I fail to see the advantage of the little weights included
1616	neg	The absolutely horrible switches will only last you a matter of months
1616	neg	So if you are looking for a mouse that you have to replace every few months, go ahead and buy this
1617	pos	The weights really don't do much for me but they're a neat little feature
1617	pos	I love the extra side buttons
1617	pos	I would say that if you have a bigger hand that would work better for a couple of the top buttons
1617	pos	But quality is great, cord is nice and long so I can have my pc a good ways away from where I'm using the device
1618	pos	what more can i say
1618	pos	works great
1618	pos	if you are not a gamer though
1618	pos	you don't really need this
1619	neg	So, I got this gaming mouse after reading great reviews
1619	neg	At first it seemed great, but just after a few months, the left click button becomes inconsistently activated, which not only aggravated day to day work, but makes high stakes FPS not feasible for the hardcore gamers
1620	pos	Owned the G502 Proteous Spectrum and decided to buy this, not much of a change but when I bought this, the wireless G502 was released after a few days of buying it
1620	pos	There isn't really a big change between the old model and the new model
1621	pos	Best mouse I ever used in a while
1622	neg	Bought June 2019, in roughly a year the house has begun to double click, I can’t recommend based on how quickly it broke down
1622	neg	Ergonomics are fine, while it was working properly the mouse was fine however I woulden’t purchase a second time as the product does not withstand regular use
1622	neg	I am looking elsewhere for my replacement and would suggest looking elsewhere to potential buyers
1623	pos	Used for gaming
1623	pos	Buttons are well placed, function great
1623	pos	strong positive click
1623	pos	Programming is easy, and versatile
1623	pos	Weight system is interesting, but it not a "fine tune" I put all the weights in, and it felt fine
1623	pos	The DPS adjustment had a bigger impact on playability
1624	neg	This mouse was so close to being perfect
1624	neg	HOWEVER, this double clicking is a major issue
1624	neg	I can't drag anything without it unclicking
1624	neg	Makes it hard to game and working in DAW
1624	neg	So close to being perfect
1624	neg	I researched how to fix this problem but turns out, it happens on all G502 hero
1624	neg	Funny that's what it's called, CAUSE I WISH I SAVED MY MONEY
1625	pos	This mouse is amazing didn’t get any issues YET, the mouse is a little heavy which is fine for me and it can drag click it also has it’s own software, the build quality is great, it is good for small hands ( i guess
1625	pos	) really recommend
1626	pos	I have been waiting to get this mouse for a bit and now that I have it so pleased with it and it meets all my expectations great quality really if you are looking for a superior mouse this is it
1627	pos	Pros:Feels premiumOutstanding main buttonsScroll wheel has two modesCons:HeavyNotched scroll wheel is clunkyFree wheel scroll mode is odd
1628	pos	This product is under rated for both price and quality
1628	pos	Definitely worth $40
1629	neg	If you wanna waste your money I'm some thing, This the right thing
1629	neg	It was good for at least 2 months
1629	neg	Suddenly, it started to miss clicks, from both buttons
1629	neg	The cursor started to miss the point click precision and finally it stopped working, just like that
1630	pos	One of the highest quality gaming mice I’ve had the pleasure of purchasing
1630	pos	I frequently play rainbow six siege/cs:go/Fortnite competitively and this mouse has ABSOLUTELY made a difference
1630	pos	Feels very sturdy and premium and very comfortable to use as a dude with slightly bigger hands
1630	pos	100% a must buy in my opinion if you are even slightly a pc gaming enthusiast
1631	pos	Comfortable to hold and use mouse
1631	pos	Decent amount of extra buttons for binding keys
1631	pos	Only complaint is the wheel is super fragile
1631	pos	You barley bump it and it rotates
1631	pos	Also clicking the buttons too hard and cause the single to be sent through the wheel and it scrolls when you don't want it to
1632	pos	im currently using this as my fornite mouse, easy to bind buttons but its a heavier mouse making it a little harder to flick but better to have weight to slide
1633	neg	I love the mouse it fits my hand perfectly and the buttons are in convenient spots but the accidental double clicking ruins any type of consistency for gaming and also navigating web pages and such its just annoying
1634	pos	My son loves this mouse
1634	pos	lol
1635	pos	This is definitely a 5 star mouse
1635	pos	The double click issue is long gone and the mouse is perfect now
1635	pos	The software is extremely open, and lets me customize the mouse fully
1635	pos	It fits in my hand perfectly, and the only complaint I would have is that the button spacing is a little annoying at times, but it just takes getting used to
1636	pos	this mouse is great for larger hands, feels good, buttons take a bit to get used to but can be useful for fps games along with the weights
1637	pos	Fits my hand perfectly, and the weight is perfect with the included weights
1638	pos	I have a hard, tip-grip and have problems usually with button placement around thumb
1638	pos	Not with this mouse
1638	pos	I can dig in my thumb to my hearts content
1638	pos	Perfect weight
1638	pos	Responsive
1638	pos	Yah, great mouse, but these things do depend on your grip and own taste
1639	pos	Decent price for a nice mouse
1639	pos	Great for gaming, nice software allows pretty easy customization (macros and whatnot), and ergonomic for everyday use: working or gaming, personally feels nice to me
1640	pos	Great quality works amazingly I mean if you are looking at this mouse you should know how good anything Logitech is and it definitely keeps that great standard
1641	pos	Lasted me longer than any other mouse (almost a year), and very nice
1641	pos	Takes a good week of getting used to, but once you do it's like butter in your hands
1641	pos	If you just want a nice durable gaming mouse, look no further than this one
1642	pos	I dont need to adjust my dpi so this isnt very useful
1643	pos	Good product
1643	pos	But the wheel is too sensitive
1644	neg	I want to like this, but the driver applications they make you install DOES NOT WORK on the Apple M1 laptop
1644	neg	You won't be able to use it, so you'll be missing out on like 80% of the features you're paying for
1644	neg	Spend your money elsewhere
1645	neg	I’ve only had this thing for a couple months now and every 5-10 minutes while using the Logitech program it gives me a “ backend connection issues “ I have tried ever vacant slot on my pc to no avail
1645	neg	This is a problem that is going on with a lot of my friends as well who have this mouse
1645	neg	This is very annoying and I expected more from a high end mouse I spent my money on
1645	neg	I wasted a lot of money on this and got screwed in the long run
1646	neg	Right mouse button sticks causing delays
1646	neg	If you are gaming, this is a pretty big deal
1647	neg	The box seems to be tampered with and opened maybe
1647	neg	I haven't opened the mouse and the box it self is old and oily i think i got a used version
1647	neg	Logitech is supposed to be a good brand and I have a keyboard from them but i don't know how I got sent a used product
1647	neg	Hopefully we can work something out :/
1648	pos	The weights and software to edit all buttons the way I like are great
1648	pos	It's the perfect spot for those that do not quite want all the buttons the Razor Naga's have but need more than a standard mouse
1649	pos	It's a magnificent product that you can modify in weight, I personally have only 1 in it at the moment and it is the best Mouse I have had for everything
1649	pos	I have had from Dell's, to other logitech mice, and HyperX Mice
1649	pos	Nothing compares to this mouse
1650	pos	Bought this for my brother in law's birthday
1650	pos	Good for gaming
1651	pos	Great for gaming, easy on hands, comfortable to use
1652	pos	I've tried other mice and I ALWAYS COME BACK TO LOGI
1653	pos	Moves beautifully, feels great on the hands (which immediately made me throw my Razer Deathadder in the trash) and is INSANELY precise for gaming
1654	pos	I got this mouse for 37 dollars and it is amazing it moves really smooth and the adjustable weights actually do a little change
1654	pos	the mouse has minimum RGB but I prefer it like that because it’s not too distracting with all the lights
1655	pos	love the g502 hero best mouse ive used so far
1656	pos	I love everything about this mouse the only complaint is dpi buttons on the left mouse button get hit during hectic times on occasion I will miss click and my mouse will speed up
1657	pos	Amazing gaming mouse
1658	pos	This is by far the best mouse I've ever used
1658	pos	My only gripe is that my mouse wheel is a little loose and super sensitive, but it doesn't bother me at all
1658	pos	It's worth the money
1659	neg	Only solution that seems to show any amount of success is to replace the switch on the left-main button, or warranty it
1660	neg	you dont want this mouse it's trash
1660	neg	buy the proteus core
1661	pos	Ordered for my grandson n he loves it
1662	pos	Very comfortable to use, hate the software but overall the mouse quality is good, i like how you can adjust the weight
1663	pos	My son is a computer gamer and he absolutely loves this mouse
1663	pos	Its exactly what he expected for the price and is very happy
1663	pos	No complaints and would purchase this item again if needed
1664	neg	I had the G502 Proteous Core and the Right Mouse button started to fail
1664	neg	I then bought the G502 HERO to replace it and in less than a year the same issue happened
1664	neg	Right Mouse button fails on click, for gaming specifically it sucks massively
1664	neg	I used to love Logitech Mice, but I cannot recommend this one anymore
1664	neg	1/10
1665	pos	Only dislike is that I'm not a fan of the weird rubber/svelte material that your thumb rests on, the feel is strange and neither slippery or sticky, somewhat fails to have friction with the thumb
1665	pos	Also, the button in front of the thumb is too close, and I have small hands
1666	pos	Its the g502, fits in your hand well and has good features
1666	pos	Good mid range mouse
1667	pos	que buen mouse encantado mas de un año de uso en gaiming
1668	pos	I finally dumped Razer after having so many issues with scroll wheel clicking and the reviews around this mouse seemed fine
1668	pos	I got my first one and the middle click was broken and I would double click so I went through all the absurd trouble to mail it back
1668	pos	I got my replacement a week later and the same issue
1668	pos	These mice suck and the middle mouse click is trash
1669	pos	I like  it
1670	neg	The right click does not hold down at random times and support is useless
1671	pos	I like how simple it is to change its settings
1671	pos	All you need to do is download logitech hub and itll auto discover your logitech device if its plugged in or connected
1671	pos	It's very simple to change the buttons of the mouse and actually nice to have the extra weights in case you want a heavier or lighter mouse
1672	neg	My last g502 I replaced because the clickers got soft on the left click
1672	neg	This replacement did exactly the same thing in literally 6 months
1672	neg	Awful quality
1673	pos	I liked this mouse, cause so presised aiming and you can also change sensivity of the mouse, by using buttons, that attached to the mouse
1673	pos	Realy love this one
1673	pos	Also, do not forget to install "Logitech G" app to see more things, that ghis mouse can do
1674	pos	Mouse so good I’ve bought 3
1674	pos	Works great with no issues, programming is easy with the Logitech software
1674	pos	I recommend this to anyone and everyone
1675	neg	The mouse is fine except for the fact that I had to tear it apart twice to fix the left and right mouse button
1675	neg	The buttons were double-clicking when I barely held them down and was making it impossible to play most games
1675	neg	I had to manually take apart the mouse and fix the switches
1675	neg	Ergonomically, the mouse is very comfortable
1676	neg	This mice is already heavy, and it provide extra kit to make it heavier
1676	neg	Very confusing button
1676	neg	Not recommend for gaming, I play FPS game most of time and it made me very uncomfortable
1677	pos	The media could not be loaded
1677	pos	This mouse is super fit for me, I use it to play league and Apex everyday
1678	pos	The best mouse I have for a good price
1679	neg	This is the 2nd Logitech mouse I've had where the right mouse button stopped working correctly
1679	neg	Garbage product
1679	neg	Find another brand, this one is terrible
1680	neg	See photo
1680	neg	Delivered to me like this
1681	neg	Out of the box it looked used or almost refurbished,  but still looked virtually new, so I decided to just use it
1681	neg	FIRST MISTAKE
1681	neg	After using it almost daily for about  2 months I'm getting constant double clicks
1681	neg	Seeing as I use this for gaming this has been a major pain
1681	neg	I've read this problem a lot with this mouse, good size, but bad clicks
1682	neg	after 3 months a button stopped working, I do not recommend it for games
1683	pos	Great
1684	neg	The mouse feet is cut to the edge an unsticking an the click on the mouse works on an off this is very bad I cant even use it anymore an I jus got bought it recently
1685	neg	Mouse didn't last long
1685	neg	it started having really bad double click issues after only a few months, I would avoid it
1686	pos	I liked the feel and mousewheel for casual use
1686	pos	But in intense gaming situations the mouse wheel would rattle causing issues in aiming
1686	pos	The software must be open 24/7 as well causing performance drops in some instances
1687	pos	Great mouse and is holding up very well
1687	pos	I have noticed for people not used to it, it can be very sensitive
1687	pos	I like it though
1688	neg	I loved this mouse until the left click stopped working
1688	neg	It happened pretty fast and will not hold down or allow you to drag and highlight
1688	neg	Very annoying for work and gaming
1688	neg	I did some research and it seems like a pretty common problem for this mouse
1688	neg	Screenshot shows the mouse events of just one click
1689	pos	it is not a perfect fit but is way better for someone with large hands
1689	pos	less kinking of the fingers
1689	pos	wish it was longer but that's not the fault  of the mouse
1690	neg	Scroll wheel is literally dog water
1690	neg	I don’t know why but the scroll wheel breaks so freakin easily for no reason
1690	neg	Logitech instead of adding a useless infinite scroll wheel, please just fix your scroll wheel and make it more stable
1691	neg	Within the first month an issue with the left click double clicking began
1691	neg	Then the issues with GHub started
1691	neg	I've had to uninstall and reinstall the software twice now,  and you have to open it every time you get on your computer to reload your presets
1691	neg	If it weren't for these issues I'd be happy with it, but unfortunately it's trash and I won't be buying another Logitech product
1692	pos	Very comfortable, good amount of buttons on mouse for custom keybinds
1692	pos	Weight adjustment
1692	pos	I just dont like the mouse scroll design
1692	pos	While locked in, the mouse scroll is loud to the point people on discord point it out
1692	pos	This is only when the scroll is being used with fast movement
1692	pos	Unlocking the scroll wheel removes all the noise but is super sensitive
1692	pos	I wish the default scroll was a little less noisy
1693	neg	Used Logitech product for a long time
1693	neg	Love G9X and G602, this one is pure garbage
1693	neg	And you know what
1693	neg	it couldn't even smoothly work, every time I tried to drag any folder/file I have to wait for 2s, and then spend 2s to find the mouse pointer god knows where it moves
1694	pos	I can’t even give it 4 stars because it’s such a good mouse and the quality is so great since I’ve had it, however my only gripes are the software doesn’t allow DPI outside of in 50 intervals and there isn’t an extra side wing for my pinky since I have rather large hands
1694	pos	Still 5/5
1695	neg	I loved it for around 9 months, then the left and right mouse buttons stopped working/double clicking
1695	neg	its now 100% unusable
1695	neg	highly disappointed in this mouse, it should have lasted far longer for being an 80$ mouse
1696	pos	Bought for a friend as a Christmas gift
1696	pos	He loves it
1697	pos	Feels amazing, great all around
1698	pos	This a great gaming mouse, I got it to replace my old Logitech G500, and it's a perfect replacement
1698	pos	Highly recommended:)
1699	pos	Nice mouse
1700	pos	Like that it comes with weights
1700	pos	Just a nice hold for gaming
1700	pos	Good little mousey
1701	pos	Overall great feel and size
1701	pos	I loved that you can easily change the DPI (mouse cursor sensitivity)
1702	pos	Best mouse I've had at a fantastic price
1703	pos	this mouse is decent
1703	pos	it is playable and smooth but keep in mind if you used before 60gram mouse mine was g102 after this using g502 hero it's hard cause g502 is 120 gram
1703	pos	but in overall it's awesome mouse nice smooth comfy insane sensor
1704	neg	and looks like I lost product number somewhere
1704	neg	still have box but Logitech said serial number needs to be attached on mouse cord, not written on mouse box so I can't even RMA it
1704	neg	now trying to order replacement switches (Kailh GM 4
1704	neg	0) and then don't break mouse completely
1704	neg	sensor is good but
1704	neg	Logitech, next time don't waste whole budget on sensor and use decent switches please
1705	pos	Best mouse I ever used
1706	pos	Had to disable the thumb button
1706	pos	Other than that, highly recommend it
1707	pos	I like the ability to adjust the weight of the mouse, and the precise sensor
1707	pos	The overall look and feel is excellent, but the scroll wheel is my favorite part of the mouse
1708	pos	Best mouse I've used in this price range for gaming
1708	pos	Plenty of customizable and programmable features
1708	pos	Highly recommend
1709	pos	I normally use the side button of the wheel for productivity tasks, like copying and pasting, I didnt pay explicit attention when I started using it but now i dont use it because it kinda feels loose and I dont wanna break it, it may be just me being paranoic but overall the built quality its good
1710	pos	It's a great fit for my hand, I use the palm grip where i let my arm do most of the work
1710	pos	Extra buttons are always helpful
1710	pos	I was using a 10 dollar mouse before that would cramp up my hand and I no longer get those even after long hours of use
1711	pos	If I could I would remove the sniper button
1711	pos	I never use it and I don't think any game recognizes it
1712	pos	This is a great product
1712	pos	However it is really hard to grip with your fingers without hitting a button
1712	pos	So you are gripping it with your palm
1713	pos	I love the G502 line
1713	pos	So far this one is working great
1713	pos	It has already survived having liquid spilled on it once
1714	pos	good product
1715	pos	Wow
1716	pos	Very responsive , great product for price
1717	pos	Great overall mouse
1717	pos	I wish the wireless version wasn't more than twice the price though
1718	pos	Mouse is used, has dirt, smudges, and the wheel seems wobbly
1718	pos	other than that it seems like a nice mouse
1718	pos	i'll update the review after i replace it
1718	pos	Edit: Think I'll just go with something else
1719	pos	Love it
1719	pos	Works great
1719	pos	Speed is on point
1720	pos	Good quality mouse
1721	pos	GREAT PRODUCT
1721	pos	THANK YOU AMAZON, VENDORS, DELIVERY PERSONS AND ALL WHO CONTRIBUTE TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE
1722	pos	We bought two
1723	pos	Very price for what you get
1724	neg	The mouse wheel seems loose and clicks on it's own when I move the mouse too quick and the pads on the bottom are bubbling and not in good shape
1724	neg	Would not recommend and am very disappointed with the product
1725	pos	Love this mouse and the new hero sensor
1725	pos	My go to for bang for your buck mouse
1725	pos	You can add weights program buttons and love the infinite scroll wheel
1726	neg	This was a 5/5 star mouse for me until it developed the double clicking issue after only a month
1726	neg	It happens quite consistently now, making me paranoid whenever using it which makes it now useless to me
1727	pos	Amazing mouse, my son is loving it
1728	pos	Dpi up/down buttons are too close to left click button and you can easily misclick during gaming
1728	pos	There's also no finger rest on the right side of the mouse, only a thumb rest
1728	pos	This mouse is great for general use but terrible for gaming
1729	pos	I really love the feel of the mouse and it's very comfortable but after about 15 months the left click started either double clicking or whenever I would hold the button down, the mouse would release it and reclick
1729	pos	It became a real issue when trying to play games and needed to hold down the button
1730	pos	Great Product
1731	pos	Works dam good
1732	pos	Hands down the best mouse I have used
1732	pos	I also have used the Razer Basilisk and this one definitely feels better
1732	pos	The infinite scroll is addictive and a great feature
1733	neg	I Purchased this mouse in May of 2019 and the right mouse button is already malfunctioning
1733	neg	I game around 1-2 hours a day and have had $10 mice last longer than this
1733	neg	Very disappointed as my last 4 mice have been logitech
1734	pos	One of the best mice I have ever used (especially for general use) with a respectable sensor
1734	pos	It might be too heavy for some where twitch aiming is critical
1734	pos	I've bought Razer (which have an obvious planned obsolescence design in place) and the quality of the G502 is night and day compared to "gamer" brands like that
1735	pos	My son added this to his gaming computer, and he’s really pleased with it for the cost
1736	pos	I like this mouse a lot, it feels good in my hand, has very precise and quick movements
1737	pos	This mouse was worth buying
1737	pos	I loved that it came with weights and love the way the clicking sounds and feels
1737	pos	The mouse fits my hand even though my hand is kinda small
1737	pos	Very easy to use and install the driver and set up all the settings you would like
1738	pos	In my opinion, best gaming mouse on the market
1738	pos	Having 2 buttons I can bind by my thumb, then two extra next to the index, the mouse wheel has adaptive scroll from smooth to bump, it just feels and preforms flawlessly
1739	neg	Complete junk
1740	pos	the mouse itself is probably really good, but mine was shipped incomplete, it said used-very good, but it was well worn down in some places and is missing some weights and the bottom cover I have no problems with the mouse, but I’m unsatisfied with the seller
1741	pos	This, while seemingly a solid product, didn't fit my hand and is very heavy - I don't know why Logi even bothers with the weights, as it's already at the upper end of the weight scale in the realm of all mice on the market
1741	pos	Also, it's small-ish - I don't have particularly large hands, but it was hard to use given it's smallish size - UNLESS you're a claw gripper - in which case, it might be great for you - it wasn't for me - and given the above comments, I returned it
1742	neg	After you use the scroll wheel, there's like a 50% chance the scroll wheel reverses once afterward
1742	neg	Maybe I just have a defective model, either way it's terrible
1743	pos	The mouse works great
1743	pos	The people who are complaining about the scroll wheel breaking have clearly neglected to read the instructions and are misinterpreting an intended feature as a defect
1744	pos	Excelente
1745	pos	Best mouse I ever used 100%Worth it
1746	pos	Sets up easily very fast and accurate
1746	pos	The free wheel is a great feature
1746	pos	I am very pleased with it
1747	pos	Nothing to dislike
1748	pos	Been using it for my new gaming setup and it performs extremely well
1748	pos	Software is very useful and easy to use
1748	pos	I paired the mouse with my Logitech G910 Orion
1748	pos	Best peripherals I've ever used
1749	neg	Just like some other dude here mentioned, I had the same problem
1749	neg	Dented box, fingerprints on the weights, strong smell of them being oiled and scratches all over the mouse - not cool at all considering I paid the full price of 80$ and got something renewed and used which is worth 40$ at best
1749	neg	Absolutely disappointing
1750	pos	Works nice and smooth
1751	pos	As of this week, about 9 months in, started experiencing issues with double clicking
1751	pos	Thought it was a game issue, but proceeded to minimize windows instead of drag them
1751	pos	It's very nice otherwise
1751	pos	Going to see if it is still within warranty
1751	pos	I am hesitant as other have reported the double clicking issue, so I wonder if it will just happen again
1752	pos	recommended for small hands, it's pretty good for gaming and for all day use, only problem is that you have to install Logitech software to change colors on the mouse
1753	pos	The mouse feel great and is very responsive, the only draw back is the weird feel of the mouse wheel, it feel cheap
1753	pos	But overall a great mouse for the price
1754	pos	use the weights to get the optimal balance between aim and comfort
1754	pos	Perfect mouse with no driver issues  like the razor crap mouse I replaced
1754	pos	Price is right and the performance is even better
1754	pos	I have big hands but I claw mu mouse
1754	pos	If you palm it might be a little small for that
1754	pos	Otherwise awesome mouse and I would recommend it
1755	pos	only complaints about this are the mouse scroll side to side clicks are squishy and the dpi up and down could be better
1755	pos	i like rubber texture on the mouse scroll this has a slightly slippery metal
1756	neg	If you like a smaller mouse, I guess this is fine
1756	neg	But it felt terrible in my hand and the scroll wheel felt like like a piece of lead
1757	pos	Ergonomically it fits my hand well
1757	pos	I have large hands and have no problem with it
1757	pos	Adding the weights makes it feel a lot more precise and I needed that coming from a lighter mouse
1758	neg	Idk why everyone loves this mouse, at least to me it feels really weird in hand and not the most optimal gaming mouse out there
1759	neg	Purchased in October
1759	neg	Mouse lasted for barely over half a year before succumbing to the infamous "double click & drag" disease
1760	neg	Started support process on 6-12-2020 it is now 7-16-2020, had to jump thru ridiculous amounts of red tape to get it send back
1760	neg	Now they have had it since 7-6-2020 and nothing from them about getting a replacement for defective mouse
1760	neg	Unacceptable from such a well known company
1760	neg	Very displeased
1761	pos	Great mouse besides the materials and lack of software for the scrolling
1761	pos	The material for thumb rest is very difficult to clean and easy to destroy
1761	pos	I bought a second one three years later after the first one stopped working one day
1762	neg	This thing which is simply spin out of control, pin the mouse to the top of the screen, or the bottom of the screen and really mess up your orientation at random
1762	neg	It took about two months to get through logitech technical support, however, they did replace the mouse
1763	pos	I purchased this about three months ago
1763	pos	I would buy it again
1763	pos	no issues in the first three months
1764	pos	Excellent mouse for all around use
1764	pos	The sensor is excellent,  buttons are good with good clicks
1764	pos	The g hub software is good as well
1764	pos	You can set different profiles for different use cases
1764	pos	I like the aesthetics too
1764	pos	I like being able to adjust the weight and balance of the mouse
1765	pos	Button positioning is excellent but runs a little short for long hands, wrist is left exposed and exerts pressure on mouse-pad unless you hold it up
1766	neg	The mouse will stop shooting when playing fps games
1766	neg	It will happen every time you are shooting the enemy
1766	neg	(especially WARZONE)
1767	pos	The mouse has poor weight distribution, the mass center is high because of the heavy metal wheel, and it dangles a lot horizontally in hyper scroll mode
1767	pos	The hand gets tired quickly, the wrist hurts after gaming or working with graphics
1767	pos	Also, the right button sticks to fingers from sweat and rattles loudly
1768	neg	This thing mouse is good, my problem is that it kept double clicking after a certain point of its lifespan, the first one was after a year, then after less then 2 months the second one
1768	neg	And in my confusion I looked up if anyone else had problems and apparently it's a common problem
1768	neg	It's a good mouse but unless they fix that double click issue then I can't recommend it
1768	neg	And yes it double clicked even wired in
1769	pos	Gaming
1770	pos	Overall not a bad mouse, the materials are very premium and buttons are fully customizable with the Logitech software
1770	pos	NOTE: if you are coming from a light weight or this is your first mouse, know that even without the additional weights, this mouse might be heavier but you can get used to it
1771	pos	Good mice for the price, the Logitech ghub allows for alot of customization
1772	pos	Even improved my productivity after getting these
1772	pos	The fantastic speed and sensitivity on this mouse makes me feel like I have never been in full control before, and now I am
1772	pos	It makes me feel alive
1773	pos	so, i have had major issues with the click and click and drag
1773	pos	cant click and drag a file around, it just releases mid move
1773	pos	really not impressed
1773	pos	put up with it long enough
1774	pos	Nothing to dislike so far
1774	pos	It appears to be very robust and responsive to inputs
1774	pos	The customization is a great addition
1775	pos	I love this mouse but download the Logitech GHUB software from a web browser
1775	pos	Makes a world of difference being able to program each button and delete the dpi changing buttons to helpful ones to game with
1776	pos	i bought  protection for my logitech g502 hero wire mouse an my mouse button are miss clicking an the mouse wheel button u push right isnt working either and the  under grip that help it slide is peeling off i tired to contact square trade website an do a claim but says it cant find it when ik i bought it for the mouse cause this was the only 2 thing i bought that day i have only had it about a year PLS HELP
1777	pos	Great gaming mouse
1777	pos	For the price this is far better than any Naga
1777	pos	Exceptional quality and functionality
1778	pos	Works great the sensor is precise enough to get me the snaps I need in game
1779	pos	For the average user I know it’s an excellent mouse
1779	pos	I have larger hands than the average person and this mouse is not made well for that, especially in the thumb area
1779	pos	The curvature is too much and my thumb doesn’t rest well and collides with the side buttons quite a bit
1779	pos	This is a personal issue yes, but one to keep in mind
1780	pos	one of the best mice ive ever used
1781	pos	beatiful cheap
1782	pos	Nothing to dislike about it at all Great quality mouse choice for a gamer been lookung for a mouse worth using but now ive found it 100% recommend for anybody looking for a great quality mouse ive had many mice but this one is def my favorite hands down
1783	neg	My son saved his money to purchase this Mouse
1783	neg	Only 1/2 the lights work
1783	neg	It arrived that way
1783	neg	Disappointing to pay $40 and not all parts work
1784	pos	Great mouse and easy to configure
1785	pos	Just wanted a few more buttons than my g203
1785	pos	This serves its purpose so far
1786	pos	4 stars for gaming because of the g hub software
1786	pos	It doesn't like to auto switch like it's supposed to
1786	pos	But the mouse itself is much better than the last gaming mouse I used
1787	neg	Left clicking and holding to drag are not working
1787	neg	The button works only intermittently
1787	neg	This mouse was bought four months ago today and now does not work
1788	pos	Very reliable mouse ,great Item
1789	neg	It actually hurt my hand on the very first day since the mouse is a lot bigger than normal sizes
1789	neg	When my hand finally adapted to it, then the wheel broke within 2 weeks of use
1789	neg	So I am returning it with a 1 star
1790	pos	I purchased this mouse 6-7 months ago, two months ago it started to randomly double click
1790	pos	The build quality and ergonomics of this mouse are good, but the double click is hard to use since I mostly use this mouse for shooting games
1790	pos	This problem may be due to an older version of the mouse, but I do not recommend buying this mouse
1791	pos	this is my second one, i had my first for over two years still works great but the fly wheel was a little worn so i bought the latest edition
1791	pos	still works great
1792	pos	I love this mouse
1792	pos	It's nice, crisp and responsive
1792	pos	I instantly noticed a difference while gaming with it and it's very comfortable to use for hours on end
1793	pos	Love this mouse and it works great
1793	pos	You can adjust the weight and program the buttons as well and I find the buttons easy to press even the ones on the side
1794	pos	The dpi buttons are right next to the left mouse button so while trying to shoot in game you may trigger the max dpi and start spinning
1795	pos	Got it for a Christmas present for my son and he absolutely loves it says it works great for all of his gaming needs
1796	pos	Amazing mouse for 40$ , you won't be disappointed
1797	pos	It's worth the upgrade from the G502 Proteus Spectrum
1797	pos	I can feel the difference in the sensor, and it is made to last longer
1798	pos	Very casual gamer here
1798	pos	Maybe play 4-8 hours a week
1798	pos	I mostly play shooters
1798	pos	The right mouse button (aim) started to not respond when clicked
1798	pos	Tried to clean with can of air
1798	pos	Took apart and cleaned with rubbing alcohol
1798	pos	Nothing worked
1799	pos	Like
1800	pos	for gaming its best
1801	pos	Can't get a better mouse for the price
1801	pos	Built well and feels comfortable
1801	pos	I like that you can add the weights to get that just right feel
1802	neg	This mouse was great out of the box and I had no problems with it until 4 months later my left click suffers from random double clicks on my single clicks
1802	neg	I have no clue how it came to this but it saddens me
1802	neg	It's still kinda usable, but the unintentional double clicks can be annoying and actually quite dangerous
1802	neg	It's quite a struggle
1803	pos	Great product for a great price
1804	pos	This device is a replacement of my old mouse
1804	pos	Much more comfortable and responsive than my old one
1804	pos	It is well built, but then again, what’s there to expect from Logitech
1805	pos	Great mouse except the wheel is very sensitive and has some left/right play in it
1805	pos	Great for web browsing/scrolling, but ex: switching weapons during gaming leaves you sometimes going past the desired selection
1806	pos	My sons used this for gaming, it react very fast , comfortable , agronomic, even afrer a lot of hours of playing their hands fills great , without any pain, another great product from Logitech technology
1807	neg	During my use of the mouse it worked great and the software was easy to use but after a year this mouse has stopped clicking consistently on the left mouse button
1808	neg	would be perfect if it was quality
1809	pos	The mouse works great and feels awesome but the little weights that come with it have a horrible vomit-like smell that stays on your hands for hours
1809	pos	all in all, good mouse
1810	pos	Good hand fit, thinner then the Corsair I was using, very light but does come with weights if your in to that sorta thing
1811	pos	It looks and feels super high quality, but the scroll wheel is rough and not very smooth, and the weights don't change it much, I'm waiting on my new mousepad because it doesn't glide well on my current one so I had to order yet another item to use it comfortably
1811	pos	Other than that, I would rate it 5★
1812	pos	Good for gaming, however sometimes the speed is hard to balance
1812	pos	Sometimes I click the button by accident and hard to fix back
1813	pos	All around my favorite mouse but i received a 16k sensor version, probably why the price is like half off kinda drawlin but great mouse
1814	pos	Great mouse for gaming
1814	pos	It's a little on the small side for my hand so it cramps up after long sessions
1814	pos	But overall a good mouse
1815	pos	I love this mouse
1815	pos	I bought it specifically for the weights, which allows me to make it the perfect weight for sniping
1815	pos	Just a heads up - the scroll may seem broken
1815	pos	There’s a button next to the scroll to lock it
1815	pos	Thought that mine was broken until I found the button
1816	pos	Perfect
1817	pos	I like the look and feel of this mouse, for gaming, and surfing the we, --it has more than enough buttons to be assigned to all the tasks,
1818	neg	Left click stopped working
1818	neg	I can’t click and hold since the hold only registers intermittently
1818	neg	Piece of garbage now
1819	pos	Pro:-great hand feel-great weight and can adjust weight-super accurate-scroll wheel has really great tactile feedbackcons:-really need to use logitech software to get it dialed into preference
1820	pos	It feels pretty heavy even without the extra weights
1820	pos	Accurate movements and great feel make this probably the best mouse I have used
1821	neg	Pain in the rear mouse
1821	neg	Keeps refusing to recognize long presses
1821	neg	Cant drag anything around my screen anymore
1821	neg	Logitech like other brands seem to be going downhill in design
1821	neg	Was such a huge fan of this company
1822	pos	This mouse is amazing, it is very comfortable to hold and the response is fantastic
1822	pos	I love the quick Change of resolution and the feedback from the buttons
1823	pos	Very comfortable mouse
1823	pos	Easy to configure
1823	pos	The weight customization is really nice as well
1823	pos	Loving this mouse
1824	neg	mouse wheel did not last a month
1824	neg	its broken
1824	neg	the buttons are fine but for some reason wont stay programmed
1824	neg	a waste of my money
1825	pos	Precise, does have a good click tones on the main and side buttons
1826	pos	Great mouse works and functions well
1827	pos	Good feeling mouse all around, but the main problem my head with this gaming mouse was it’s free scrolling scroll wheel
1827	pos	There are many times that I would play a game and use the scroll wheel to swap between weapons and find myself using a different weapon when I intentionally scroll to because of the scroll wheel being free locking
1828	pos	I recommend it
1829	pos	The one complaint I have is that based on placement of the dpi shifters, if you don't have a whole lot of room, you'll bash it and change your dpi
1829	pos	This can be changed in GHub though, so it's not too big a deal
1830	neg	This is a great mouse
1830	neg	That feels and performs amazing and the weight can adjusted to your preference
1830	neg	However, the left mouse button started double clicking randomly regardless of the computer it was used on
1830	neg	This is a known issue with logitech mice
1830	neg	If it wasn't for that this would be a perfect mouse
1831	pos	Bought to replace Logitech mouse with broken scroll wheel
1831	pos	Mouse feels on the small side
1831	pos	Even with all the included weights, the mouse tilts forward when left clicking
1832	pos	The actual performance of the mouse is great, but the location of the buttons for raising/lowering sensitivity is RIGHT next to the left click
1832	pos	This has resulted in unexpected sensitivity changes in the middle of games which is infuriating
1833	pos	I long for the day plastic is no longer used
1833	pos	Plastic is shitty does not matter because the material is cheap and ugly
1833	pos	the side buttons are annoying at times
1833	pos	over all gaming experience has been great
1834	pos	Great deal for what I paid for it
1834	pos	Lots of options and all buttons have a good feel to them
1835	pos	I love this mouse
1835	pos	All the buttons work fine, and the smooth scroll wheel glides for a really long time
1835	pos	Its very comfortable
1835	pos	If you like light gaming mice, this is a bit heavy even with no weights
1836	pos	I purchased this mouse for about $40-$50 dollars, and it was a great upgrade from my previous Red Dragon mouse
1836	pos	I enjoy being able to map the buttons for production
1837	neg	ive had it like 2 weeks it constantly disconnects when plugged in, i just had to plug it in 5 times for it to finally connect its absolutely awful already deteriorated enough to where it barely works and i havent even taken it off the desk
1838	pos	Good mouse
1838	pos	Has buttons
1838	pos	I click them
1838	pos	Has some minor customization with some plastic pieces
1839	pos	Cumple todo lo deseado
1840	neg	At first, I liked it, it was nice and sturdy, it looked good and felt good
1840	neg	But after a while of using it, I noticed that it kept hiccuping, like the cursor on the screen would stop while I was moving the mouse, this proved very difficult to deal with since it refused to move at one point while I was playing a game
1840	neg	A waste of 50 bucks
1841	pos	Bought it for fps gaming and so far loving it, the added features such as the dpi button, scroll lock and the ability to balance weight according to your will is quite impressive
1842	pos	I ordered it on accident
1843	pos	Feels great in your hand and is customizable with the weights
1843	pos	The number of buttons to program works out really well for me playing everything from EFT and Cod to WoW and New World
1844	pos	It’s fken perfect
1844	pos	Although the software is a bit tricky for an untrained eye
1844	pos	I highly recommend this product for any gamer to have
1844	pos	I Originally wanted the wireless version but it’s overpriced so I’ll just settle for this one
1845	pos	Great mouse
1846	neg	Disappointed that the left click of the mouse stopped working properly after a year's use
1847	pos	This product is really bad
1847	pos	It's hard to hold with my massive hands and the set up is anoyingly hard to do
1847	pos	The only good thing about this product is it's rgb can be customized slightly
1848	pos	a nice mouse
1849	pos	I mean it
1849	pos	11 buttons which are configurable
1849	pos	Check
1849	pos	Extremely comfortable
1849	pos	Check
1849	pos	Ridiculously responsive
1849	pos	Absolutely
1849	pos	RGB
1849	pos	Yup
1849	pos	Epic scroll wheel
1849	pos	Yuppers
1849	pos	DPI shifter
1849	pos	Yup
1849	pos	Trust me and get this mouse
1849	pos	You won't regret it in the slightest
1850	pos	Take one star off because it is too sensitive
1851	pos	Works well
1851	pos	If you want to configure the buttons you need to download Logitech Gaming Software to your computer
1851	pos	You can assigned timed macros and single key presses to any button
1851	pos	There is a middle button which is automatically set to change the mouse’s configuration “profile”
1851	pos	This makes it easy to change your configuration from one game to the other with only a single press
1851	pos	I highly recommend this mouse
1852	pos	It good for its price
1852	pos	After a month, I started to hear the scroll wheel squeak a tad bit
1853	pos	Feels sturdy great tracking macros are easy to setup clicks feel good
1854	pos	Is a good mouse, very ergonomic, and I like the customization tools with it, but the main issue is Drag & Drop
1854	pos	It doesn't make sense that I had to revert to an Amazon basics mouse, because I can't drag and drop with the Logitech G502 Hero
1854	pos	Very frustrating
1855	pos	Amazing mouse
1855	pos	Bought to connect to a gaming laptop and it works great
1855	pos	No lag
1855	pos	Very smooth
1856	neg	it's a pain
1857	pos	I got it to help with my wrist issues and it definitely did
1858	pos	Great for gaming, DPI buttons too close to left click, but you get used to it
1858	pos	Very durable, I've RAGED and slammed this thing and it's lasted
1859	pos	Very good quality and comfort
1859	pos	Great for gaming
1860	pos	X-mas gift for young grandson
1860	pos	He is a gamer and says it is easy to handle
1861	pos	People who like flatter wider mice to rest their hand on should look elsewhere
1862	neg	Just less than a month with using it not that much and suddenly the middle wheel button is not clicking anymore and it's broken
1863	pos	Increíble mouse, estoy muy contento con el
1863	pos	Los múltiples botones funcionan perfectamente
1863	pos	La posibilidad de hacer scroll infinito es muy útil
1863	pos	Lo único que me molesta solo un poco es la posición del botón sniper que es solo un poco difícil de alcanzar
1863	pos	Del resto está perfecto
1864	pos	This mouse really is great
1864	pos	I use it for engineering design, for the programmable buttons
1864	pos	Logitech really put the buttons in the right spots
1864	pos	The design is solid and feels durable
1864	pos	I have all of the auxiliary weights in it and I really like the feel of that
1864	pos	I love it
1865	pos	Good product but the money paid for it is a bit expensive
1865	pos	We needed it so purchased it, but wont buy it again, only because of the price
1865	pos	The value is decent
1866	neg	The "customizeable features" are horrible
1866	neg	You can't customize all the buttons, only like 3 of them, and when you do change the features they keep resetting and you have to go through the whole process of customizing everying again
1867	pos	No more recharging and having it go dead in the middle of a raid
1868	pos	for $50, has all I want
1869	pos	I like the weights to customize the "feel" when using the mouse
1869	pos	Buttons are easy to program and intuitively designed
1870	pos	I used the legendary Logitech MX518 since 2010
1870	pos	Made the leap and it was worth it
1870	pos	It took me two weeks to get confident with it, so if you buy it and wonder if you regret switching, just give it some more time
1871	pos	Can't map all the buttons for some reason but other then that it's really good the scrolling is the best vary smooth 👌
1872	pos	This mouse is perfect for gaming
1872	pos	Fits my hand really well
1872	pos	Accurate and responsive
1872	pos	Really like the weights that come with it
1872	pos	allows you to adjust the feel of the mouse
1872	pos	Would buy again
1873	pos	How I have missed you
1873	pos	And to have you upgraded now
1873	pos	I'm having a handful of mousey pleasure right now
1873	pos	In fact, I liked it so well I got it for work too
1874	pos	Good deal
1875	pos	Bought it for my son, who had the Razer DeathAddr before it
1875	pos	He is very happy with it
1875	pos	He claim that it is more comfortable for FPS games then the Razer
1875	pos	The app is also more intuitive and easy to use
1876	pos	Excellent mouse overall
1876	pos	Love the way it feels & you can tell right out of the box that it's quality all around
1876	pos	May get another sometime down the road for my laptop
1877	pos	overall a good mouse have had it for about 3 months and the only problems that i have are that for my claw grip it is not the best and the bottom is alrady starting to ware
1877	pos	on all other counts one of the best mice that i have ever used
1878	pos	Overall good mouse and the logitech ghub software makes it easy to program any of the programmable buttons
1878	pos	My only issue is the scroll wheel feels a bit too loose
1878	pos	Its not as tactile as i would have liked
1878	pos	Maybe thats because of its second free spinning mode
1879	pos	Hi, you just started reading reviews for the Logitech G502 Hero mouse
1879	pos	Stop scrolling down, and click add to cart
1880	neg	AVOID
1881	pos	Everything arrived as expected, pretty good mouse, my second G502
1882	pos	Have you ever felt the need to go through all of your weapons 6 times over in under 1 second
1882	pos	How about only spamming overhead or thrust attacks without having to keep your finger on the mouse wheel
1882	pos	Well now you can
1882	pos	And if you don't want to use the Chad Scroll Wheel feature, you can just lock it in place
1883	pos	This Mouse Is The Best Selling Gaming Mouse In The World, Amazing
1884	pos	I love the feel and motion of this mouse , glides through your mat like butter , Weights were something i didint know i needed till i tried them
1884	pos	:p overall so happy with this mouse i just had to write a review
1884	pos	hehe
1885	pos	It is only needs to be wired when charging
1886	pos	Best mouse that i ever had
1886	pos	Maybe to many buttons for me personally
1886	pos	Other than that, sensational mouse
1887	neg	Only been using it for a few months and right click is messing up
1887	neg	The scroll is super heavy and loud
1888	neg	Have used Logitech products for years
1888	neg	This mouse was fine until the left button started freaking out
1888	neg	Warranty process has been ridiculous so far
1888	neg	Still waiting for a response after jumping through several hoops to prove the issue and that I actually purchased it
1889	pos	Great feel and comfort to use
1889	pos	I love the added weights to customize the mouse
1889	pos	Really helps when aiming and precision movements
1889	pos	Totally recommend this product
1890	pos	As a college student who just built their first PC, I went to see the recommended products for my tower and peripherals
1890	pos	The G502 was one and I don’t regret it
1890	pos	Having multiple mouse buttons plus the G-Hub driver/application helps in fine tuning DPI to you needs, wether it be gaming or productivity
1891	pos	Perfect
1892	pos	As of today I got this mouse but as I checked the ratings I have read that their was a chance for your mouse being used which is true
1892	pos	The mouse wasn't scratched or anything like that it looked fairly new but when I checked the weights I saw fingerprints, scratches and steins
1892	pos	If the mouse was in the same shape as the weights I would give the rating a 1 star and other than that it is just as what 5 star raters say
1893	pos	good value
1894	pos	Very solid mouse
1894	pos	It feels like it would last a lifetime, and it's very comfortable to use as well
1894	pos	I'm not a huge fan of the mouse wheel, but it doesn't detract from the over quality of the mouse
1895	pos	This item was gifted
1895	pos	I believe the recipient is very pleased
1896	neg	I was planning to buy a new one, but I received a used oneThe condition was bad
1896	neg	1
1896	neg	There is no weight2
1896	neg	The scroll is too heavy3
1896	neg	There was hair on the backAfter all, I put it in the garbage without using it
1896	neg	I'm sorry just because the fit was good
1897	pos	G502 best for fever
1898	pos	Its a gamererers moused
1899	pos	Simply the best
1899	pos	The most comfortable and highest precision mouse
1899	pos	I had proteus core and I still think the hero is  better
1900	pos	like it but the light is weak
1900	pos	very good quality and decent price
1901	neg	This is my third G502, same problem
1901	neg	The right click mouse button starts to double click or not activate at all after a while
1902	pos	I went back to my G602, it seems like a smaller mouse
1902	pos	good mouse but smaller than expected
1903	pos	nice feel to it
1904	pos	This mouse is great
1904	pos	Fully programmable buttons and it fits in my hand perfect
1904	pos	All the buttons are in ideal locations for quick use
1905	pos	This mouse does the job for gaming, and general use—it certainly is a step up from generic mice
1905	pos	The only issue I personally have is the fact the DPI mode toggle switch on the side is very sensitive, and the way my hand rests on the mouse ends up toggling it a lot
1905	pos	Otherwise, this has been a great purchase
1906	pos	Priced right for a casual/pseudo competitive gamer
1906	pos	This is the peripheral for you
1907	pos	I son love his mouse, great gaming product
1908	pos	Great mouse so far
1908	pos	Moves the cursed very quickly
1908	pos	Much faster then my old mouse
1909	pos	really good mouse so far so good
1909	pos	only problem is i this thing is pretty open somewhat of a neat freak and it's hard to clean
1910	pos	Excellent mouse
1910	pos	Between this mouse, the g pro hero and the mx518 I can easily say the G502 Hero is my favorite mouse hands down
1910	pos	The only thing I would change is the scroll wheel is a little slippery when using the step mode
1911	pos	Honestly been in love with the G502 for a good while now with the adjustable movement and scrolling speeds along with the multiple buttons on the mouse itself
1911	pos	If you're a gamer this is definitely a mouse for you
1912	pos	Nice
1913	pos	The quality of this mouse is amazing it has amazing censors
1913	pos	The only downside is if you were planing on playing a game which relies heavily on the mouse scroll wheel which is very well made but may need some getting used to
1914	pos	Lo compre para jugar videos juegos
1914	pos	Excelente calidad
1915	neg	The friction less pad peeled up and this happen when i got it
1916	pos	I dont know what to say really, I dont have a lot of experience with mice
1916	pos	This is everything I could have imagined and more
1917	pos	Its a great mouse, but the new software doesn't always work right (atleast it did before I switched) but switching to the old one was easy and it works great, won't be changing it any time soon
1918	pos	You can't go wrong with this mouse, I am very impressed and pleased with the quality and features
1919	pos	Love this mouse
1919	pos	Fits my hand perfectly, and adjustable weight is very nice
1919	pos	Software with macros and lights is great
1920	pos	Like everything except the wire gets in the way
1921	pos	Mouse is kinda heavy but it fits my hand perfectly
1921	pos	(palm grip)
1921	pos	Thing is sensor running perfectly
1921	pos	At my first try my clicking acc increased %10 but tracking is kinda harder
1921	pos	(probably switching from lighter mouse)
1922	pos	good
1923	pos	This mouse has it all
1923	pos	Infinite scroll wheel, on the fly dpi switching, 5 programable buttons, removable weights, ergonomic design, rubberized texture, and the logo is rgb not to mention the Logitech G Hub software is awesome
1923	pos	I wouldn't buy any other mouse if I would have known how good this mouse is
1924	pos	I didn't want a wired mouse but I could live with it the inconvenience when the wireless version costs a lot more
1925	pos	I personally have a some problems with this mouse because of my very large hands
1925	pos	For most people I would rate as a five star but for me I can only a muster a 4 star
1926	pos	Nice mouse
1926	pos	It looked great
1927	pos	My son uses it mainly for gaming
1928	neg	In less than a year the left click button stopped working correctly and now does not hold the click
1928	neg	I'm dissapointed
1929	pos	Love the way this mouse feels
1929	pos	Only complaint is the Logitech app itself it’s hard to customize or change
1929	pos	But other then that the mouse itself is amazing
1930	pos	👍
1931	pos	This mouse is a good buy for the $50 or so
1931	pos	The mouse itself has a lot of programmable buttons but my favorite part is the way that it gives a comfortable and controlled grip
1931	pos	FYI this mouse is on the heavier end even without the weights
1931	pos	This is ok just depends on your opinion for high dps or low dps
1931	pos	Good mouse I like it :)
1932	pos	any type of high end mouse user will appreciate this
1932	pos	good ergonomics
1932	pos	feels comfy
1932	pos	solid construction
1932	pos	good scrolling
1933	pos	Love the weight, it's mostly ergonomic, but some of the extra buttons are little obscure
1934	neg	I just got the mouse, played with it for a few days and I've noticed that the mouse will spinout when playing shooters
1934	neg	Not very happy with it for that
1934	neg	The ergonomics are nice however, I wish there was a sort of grip for the pinky to rest on
1935	pos	This is the 3rd one I've bought
1935	pos	They're all wonderful
1935	pos	The software is decent, but the actual quality of the mouse is flawless
1935	pos	I cant see myself switching away from this anytime soon
1936	neg	Only had it for about a year, and now my left click is randomly double clicking when I only want a single click
1936	neg	There is a connection issue between the plate and the sensor
1937	pos	Was a pretty useful mouse for 10 months, then it developed a problem of registering a double click when I only click once or not registering me holding down the mouse button because its registered a double click
1937	pos	Makes fps a little more annoying for both automatic and single shot guns
1938	neg	g hub wont see this mouse,  only fix that works is starting in ADMIN mode
1938	neg	what the hell Logitech
1939	pos	all good
1940	pos	It fits nicely in my hand, love all the additional buttons, works awesome for my gaming and programming needs
1941	pos	Best mouse
1942	pos	My kids have used several gaming devices like this one
1942	pos	As of right now, this mouse appears to be their favorite
1943	pos	Worked like a charm until it started acting up
1943	pos	When dragging a selection it would unselect part way through and start a new selection
1943	pos	Took me a while to figure out it was a hardware mouse issue
1943	pos	Now it's unavailable to return
1943	pos	First issue I've had with a logitech product
1943	pos	Might be a fluke
1943	pos	Maddening
1944	neg	Scrolling wheel not working
1944	neg	It’s keep rotating for no reason
1944	neg	Logitech g hub don’t find this mouse for no reason
1944	neg	Total disappointment:(
1945	pos	I like the mouse, however when ever I try to move an item by drag and drop, I end up pushing the button located by the thumb
1945	pos	I have tried different grips, but always with the same effect
1946	pos	It is a really nice mouse for it's price
1947	pos	great mouse little expensive but worth it in my opinion
1948	pos	Works as expected
1949	neg	I have had to send this mouse back twice both times after the first couple uses the scroll wheel just falls apart cant move it without having the scroll wheel go flying
1950	pos	Excellent mouse, has all the right buttons and placements and excellent software to back it up
1950	pos	Also must add that I had an issue with the right click button not responding accurately to clicks
1950	pos	The company stood behind their product and shipped me out a new mouse without hassle
1950	pos	Would recommend this mouse 100%
1951	pos	Got this as part of my nephews Christmas
1951	pos	He loved it
1951	pos	Definitely loves to game so I scored points with this purchase
1952	neg	The mouse is completely missing one of the teflon feet, meaning it does not slide smoothly on a mouse pad
1952	neg	It is also missing the weights that were supposed to come with it
1952	neg	I am more than disappointed
1952	neg	I'm furious
1953	pos	Love it
1953	pos	Works great
1954	neg	almost have had it for 2 years, right click is occasionally functional most of the time it registers many clicks
1954	neg	so like, who needs to aim in a FPS
1954	neg	past that it's been pretty nice
1955	pos	Lo mejor para jugar
1956	neg	It's a piece of garbage
1956	neg	I ordered this in april 2020 and come 2021 now when i hold the right mouse button down it keeps clicking instead of holding
1956	neg	So basically don't expect it to last if you're buying this because you are tired of going through cheap mice
1957	pos	My favorite mouse Bought a razer hate it Went G50 to happy
1958	pos	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson who is a computer wiz
1958	pos	He loves it
1958	pos	Perfect gift
1959	pos	So far I love this mouse
1959	pos	I had been using a Logitech G5 mouse for years until it finally started to die a couple months back
1959	pos	I find the G502 very comfortable to hold and use
1959	pos	I love the way it looks
1959	pos	There are a lot of buttons for someone used to one at their thumb but I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it
1959	pos	I'll update if my opinion changes with more use
1960	pos	Been a Razer guy most of my PC gaming life
1960	pos	Move to the LG mouse
1960	pos	Feels great in the hand
1960	pos	The scroll wheel can be tactile or smooth
1960	pos	Plenty of customizable buttons
1961	pos	Best mouse in the market period
1961	pos	This is my 2nd time owning one
1961	pos	Upgraded from G502 to G502 Hero just for rgb because I'm a basic pleb
1961	pos	15/15⁵
1962	pos	Coming from a Corsair Scimitar to this one was a great change, I lost a lot of buttons, but this one feels better on the hand, I've improved my gameplay also with this one
1962	pos	Great mouse overall
1963	pos	works like a dream
1964	pos	Good quality, no lags and comfortable
1965	pos	I have the this and the high end keyboard
1965	pos	Use them daily
1965	pos	Time tested quality product
1965	pos	Could use the keyboard for self defense
1966	pos	Awesome mouse
1966	pos	Haven't had a single issue with it and it runs smooth
1966	pos	Love how I can add and subtract weight from it
1967	pos	Love the mouse
1967	pos	It's my 2nd one I got since my friend used it and loved it so that was a perfect birthday gift
1968	pos	I had no idea a mouse could do so much
1969	pos	Looks great
1969	pos	I'm happy to keep using Logitech, I wish the price was more competitive, but it's all good
1970	neg	Inaccurate overpriced piece of garbage
1971	pos	This is a great mouse
1971	pos	I was having issues with my wired mouse getting interference
1971	pos	I was worried the cord would get in the way, but it does not
1971	pos	This is has a nice weight and feels nice
1972	neg	I loved this mouse, and it would have been my "forever" mouse if the left button hadn't stopped working after 3 months of use
1972	neg	Infuriating
1973	pos	My daughter liked it for her gaming

1976	neg	Trash
1977	pos	It is comfortable, responsive, and just all around a great mouse
1977	pos	I have ZERO cons for this mouse
1978	neg	Scroll wheel only registering 1/0 of the scrolls after a month of use

1979	pos	I think it's a good mouse just too heavy for me
1980	pos	Works well
1980	pos	Has a design that takes getting use to
1980	pos	I had a double click problem only 2 months of having it but I  fixed it
1981	neg	I've had the same mouse since forever but these latest ones are built like hot garbage

1982	pos	This mouse feels so smooth and comfortable
1982	pos	Very responsive and can be easily adjusted
1982	pos	Plus you can adjust it's weight with inserts that go in the bottom of the mouse for a personalized feel
1983	pos	Good for gaming

1985	pos	Bought this mouse about a week ago, the standard weight feels really comfortable to me but I really like how I can add or subtract weight

1985	pos	Really happy with my purchase and will definitely look to this brand for future upgrades

1993	neg	Would not recommend

1994	pos	it’s a great mouse with awesome tracking

1997	pos	I won't continue to use it to find out how long it will really last as I have a spare already
1998	pos	Thoroughly enjoy this product
1998	pos	I just want to say don’t think your mouse wheel is broken when you get it
1998	pos	There is a button on the mouse that stops it from forever spinning and it is located right under the scroll wheel

2020	pos	It bothers me since it is new, shouldn't have issues so soon
2021	pos	Excellent material for a good price
2022	pos	Works great as intended
2023	neg	Not sure if it’s genuine or not but no excuse for the glider pad to be nowhere near where it’s supposed to be fresh out of a sealed box

2024	pos	I won’t buy another mouse until the new version comes out
2025	pos	I use this mouse primarily for normal computer use and some gaming (World of Warcraft)
2025	pos	It works perfectly and it fits very nice in my hand
2025	pos	The DPI is fully adjustable and I have tuned it to my personal preference so that it's not too sensitive or too dull for the expected movement that I need

2026	pos	Amazon sent me a used/open box mouse with hair in the section for the weights
2026	pos	Returned and picked up from Best Buy
2026	pos	Still a great mouse
2027	pos	I'm very picky with mice size and weight, and I've been pleasantly surprised with this one
2027	pos	It also has a couple extra buttons near the left-click button, which is awesome

2033	neg	Skip this and get the proteus instead
2034	pos	I loved this mouse VERY MUCH
2034	pos	, it is super comfortable and it looks super high quality
2035	pos	Not much to say, It is a really good Gaming Mouse
2036	pos	good mouse but too small if you have big hands
2037	pos	Love the weight and how sensitive the mouse buttons are, makes for easiness in FPS games
2037	pos	Wish there were more usable buttons though and not so many that affect your DPI
2037	pos	Overall, great mouse

2045	pos	Back button on side is too easily, accidentally pressed other wise a great product
2046	neg	Less than 1 year old mouse, left mouse button double clicks all the time
2046	neg	I've tried various tweaks to settings and swapping usb ports and nothing fixes the issue
2046	neg	It's a known faulty switch-BUYER BEWARE
2047	neg	Worked fine for a short while and then died
2047	neg	The ergonomics of this mouse are really weird too
2047	neg	So unless you have small hands and long fingers prepare to be uncomfortable
2047	neg	And the sniping button is way way too far forward to be any use
2048	neg	Extremely heavy and very slick
2048	neg	Only my second mouse I’ve ever bought but I went back to my g403 within about 3 hours of unboxing this mouse
2048	neg	Also sounded like something was rattling every time I moved it
2048	neg	Cheaply made
2049	pos	I hate this mouse wheel almost as much as I hate Jeff
2049	pos	Other than that it’s nice
2050	neg	When we went to program the dpi button it didn’t work and tried five times and still didn’t work
2051	pos	This mouse is so good that i should only mention the negatives
2051	pos	1-) It's a bit smaller than i expected
2051	pos	Pay attention before buying2-) some accidental clicks
2051	pos	3-) The software is a little tricky
2051	pos	in both finding and using it
2051	pos	Other than these minor inconveniences, it's a highly recommended mouse
2051	pos	I love it
2052	pos	Best mouse I have ever owned
2053	pos	It's a good mouse, but if you use index finger on left click and middle finger on right click, your little finger and ring finger tend to fall off with no where to go and feels uncomfortable
2054	pos	Sooo good
2054	pos	Using it for 4 months now
2054	pos	It's a beautiful thing

2057	pos	very smooth in game
2057	pos	you can pay more, but you can't really get a better gaming mouse
2057	pos	as long as the ergonomics of this mouse fit you hand, it's a winner
2058	pos	Its amazing performs great and app lets you customize dpi amazingly for certain games I just wish the buttons to change dpi were not as close to left click button
2059	neg	Just be careful with this mouse, as eventually the mouse wheel will quite easily wear down and spin uselessly
2060	pos	I love all the buttons on the mouse it definitely great for fps games
2060	pos	also the setup is super easy
2060	pos	you can customize the lighting and button functionality with the Logitech app
2061	neg	Mouse is great in your hand
2061	neg	The click sounds are good
2061	neg	Everything can be tailored with the Logitech app
2061	neg	Except the Primary click stopped working after 6 months
2061	neg	I wrote to the support team 2 weeks ago and have yet to hear back from them
2061	neg	If you're willing to buy a mouse every six months this mouse is for you
2061	neg	:/
2062	neg	About 2 1/2 months the left click started to not register, month later and now the right is doing the same while getting worse
2062	neg	I've used a older version of this same mouse and can confidently say the quality has gone down over the years
2063	neg	I bought this mouse and a keyboard, the keyboard and the amazon box in which both products came was perfect, the only thing that was broken is the mouse, so i think they gave me an used mouse
2064	pos	I love this it may be a little overpriced but if you love gaming get this
2065	pos	Bought for my grandson and he loves it

2082	pos	Easy to customize
2083	neg	Almost after a month of buying the mouse and only a few hours of gaming use per day, the bout feet(bottom side) starts peeling which very annoying and messes up how the mouse functions
2083	neg	Do not recommend buying for gaming and for daily use
2084	pos	This mouse is great for gaming

2085	pos	It's easy to use and perfect for gaming
2085	pos	I would recommend this to anyone
2085	pos	(:
2086	pos	Online product claims it has a 25k DPI sensor but when it arrived it clearly says 16k
2086	pos	Overall decent mouse for $40
2086	pos	Wish the mouse clicks were quieter
2087	neg	The most was ok for the first 5-6 weeks but less than 2 months of use the wheel stopped working completely
2088	pos	Got this for my son for Christmas he loved it
2089	pos	Thumb position is a bit cramped but that is to be expected as there are buttons there that are supposed to be easy to press
2089	pos	All in all it a quality mouse with very nice feel
2090	pos	I like it is kind of heavy even without the weights on it but it’s cool good sensor good wire
2091	pos	Bought this mouse in December 2018, just last night the right click stopped working
2091	pos	Here I am buying it again
2091	pos	Absolutely fantastic mouse 10/10 would buy a 3rd time too
2092	pos	Great mouse, took me a few days to realize I could lock and unlock the scroll wheel so it wasnt spinning like crazy but aside from that it is a good mouse for casual gaming
2093	pos	Solid mouse with solid software
2093	pos	I love the 3 profiles you can switch between and the ability to switch dpi speeds during a game
2093	pos	Rgb is pretty minimal but I love the mouse
2094	pos	Awesome
2095	pos	Super comfortable, a little heavy but it glides really well on my mousepad so i dont notice it
2095	pos	Looks really nice too
2096	pos	Very ergonomic, good material, and good for gaming, Some times it doesn't work but in 99% sure that it's just my mouse
2097	pos	This mouse is everything i was looking for but the only downside thats not even noticeable is the 3rd light went out seconds after i plugged it in and used it but overall the weights are good and the sniper button is useful
2098	pos	Muy practico
2099	pos	Great mouse
2099	pos	With keybinds, my gaming experience has improved and I am happy with this purchase
2100	pos	The mouse works great

2101	pos	Before i got this i had been in desperate need for a better mouse and all i can say is i love it
2101	pos	Worth the buy
2102	pos	Great for gaming and comfortable

2106	pos	Love the feel
2106	pos	I have small hands and this fits very well
2106	pos	Love how I can control the weight
2107	pos	Good
2108	pos	The Scroll wheel broke in less than a week, I do use the mouse every day for hours, but a week of lifespam is ridiculous
2109	pos	Everything works fine for me
2109	pos	I was a bit worried since many of the reviews complained about buttons not working, but I haven't experienced any issues so far
2109	pos	Definitely worth the price
2110	pos	No me agrado que en el título dijera como nuevo, llegó sin caja, el alambre de conexión un poco maltratado, sin sus pesas y pues el precio fue de casi 60 dólares me esperaba algo un poco más
2111	pos	Huge step up from my old mouse
2111	pos	Good weight and has a nice smooth "grippy" feel
2111	pos	Only wish it had a few more buttons but I'm definitely happy with it
2112	pos	Feels great, works consistently, and the configuration software is actually functional
2112	pos	Would recommend this over RedDragon or Corsair mice any day
2113	pos	Me llego todo bien pero no tengo fotos xd
2114	pos	The product is very good, it arrives in perfect condition, at the beginning it takes a little getting used to (I used a smaller mouse), in general very good product
2115	pos	Was great, until left button just stopped working outta nowhere after a couple months
2116	pos	Amazing featureset, great options customizable from Logitech G Hub or the older Logitech Gaming Software
2116	pos	Only issues I've heard is on the software side, hopefully Logitech can work that out
2117	pos	This is a great product, but I recommend getting the wireless for people who uses a laptop
2117	pos	The wire is a bit of a drag, but overall still works the same way
2118	pos	For some people who’s week or spent a long time on gaming this mouse is very heavy
2118	pos	But it have perfect griping sense and smooth on mouse pad, so it’s a great mouse
2119	pos	I bought it for the purpose of gaming and it is perfect
2119	pos	All the buttons are mappable to suit your gaming needs
2120	pos	Logitech G502 - This mouse is one of the apex best out there
2120	pos	The looks, feel, and sensitivity of it are unmatched
2120	pos	The ability to reduce or increase the weight to what works for your personal choice is outstanding
2120	pos	100% satisfied
2121	pos	Love it
2121	pos	Would highly recommend to those for gaming 100%
2122	pos	This is exactly what I was looking for and fits my hand and grip perfectly
2122	pos	Would strongly recommend to anyone who is looking into a new gaming mouse
2123	pos	For gaming and internet
2124	pos	As a lot of other people says, this is a great buy
2125	pos	It works very well in every aspect
2125	pos	My only complaint is that the dpi presets on xbox are a little slow
2126	pos	Good mouse
2126	pos	Quite unusual form, uncomfortable from the beginning
2126	pos	But after one week of the usage everything is fine
2127	pos	I love the G502 I've had three so far the first died due to it being dropped during a move the second had a bad left switch that would multiple click
2127	pos	Now I have this one and it works great for price
2128	neg	ive had this mouse for a little over a month and the right click started to double click AFTER A MONTH
2129	pos	pressed the infinite scroll button and let her rip, hasn't stopped scrolling for over 2 hours
2130	neg	Some clicks get doubled and it often messes up click and drag
2131	pos	I use this primarily to play FPS and it works great
2131	pos	It is very comfortable and the buttons are convenient
2131	pos	My picture is after two weeks of use
2132	pos	Very nice
2133	pos	Get it
2134	neg	Several people have this same problem, but the mouse only lasts <1 year before the click feature breaks and behind frequently double clicking without even letting go of the button
2135	neg	Did not last long have to return got it For Christmas for my grandson I haven’t had time to refund if I have one but thumbs down 👎
2136	pos	Feels comfortable in my hand slides easily across the mouse mat
2137	neg	Plugged it in to my pc let it do all of its updates and the stupid thing wouldnt even work
2137	neg	If you going to get this one i suggest just getting the 604 light speed
2137	neg	Much better mouse
2138	pos	This mouse I'd say is the best mouse on the market for the price, nice rgb lighting and up to 16,000 dpi
2138	pos	Mouse is comfy and having 11 programable buttons is a nice luxury
2139	pos	I like that it came with weights, to improve mobility
2139	pos	You can add or remove them easily
2139	pos	Also the design fits most hands my 9 year old can easily use the mouse
2140	pos	just hevy, but the mouse works well
2140	pos	I'd use this mouse in the office not gaming
2141	pos	I'll always be faithful to the g502
2142	pos	Great mouse awesome for gaming easy to use software would buy again
2143	pos	i love this mouse alot the only problom i have is that when i eat something greasy you see the grease on the mouse and its kinda nasty but other then that i love it and it works great
2144	pos	Great value for $50 and has everything you need in a pro gaming mouse
2145	pos	Some buttons are not able to be programmed for everything
2146	neg	Worked great for a little while
2146	neg	Lasted 8 months then began behaving erratically
2146	neg	It cannot click drag at all now and clicks vary between unresponsive and double clicking
2147	pos	Easily recommended
2148	pos	was nice but my right click no longer functions properly after only 1 year
2148	pos	guess i won't go logitech for any mice anymore
2148	pos	my g9x lasted forever (since 2011) and this was the mouse i got after the cord on that finally died
2148	pos	Obviously, build quality has gone way downhill
2149	neg	I really like this mouse but I haven't even had it for a year and I'm having issues with the right button not holding
2149	neg	It very frustrating to play first person shooter games and trying to aim down a scope because it will flicker in and out a few times
2150	pos	Definitely recommend this mouse
2150	pos	So smooth and has a ton of extra binds/buttons
2150	pos	Perfect
2151	pos	Solid mouse
2151	pos	Love that you can add or remove weights
2151	pos	I have big hands so this was a really good fit for me but it’s also comfy for my wife to use
2151	pos	Mouse wheel also is heavy and does t feel like it will break
2151	pos	Overall good mouse and worth the price
2152	pos	Good mouse but god a mouse should not be this expensive
2153	pos	Very good, move smoothly
2154	pos	If you liked the Alienware TactX mouse with the dual-scroll capability, ergonomics, and DPI buttons, this is the mouse for you
2154	pos	Free-scroll mode is even better
2154	pos	It's an excellent upgrade and excellent mouse
2155	pos	My hands are average size, I wish the whole thing was just a little smaller and had extra buttons on the right hand side as well
2155	pos	It is clearly high quality
2156	pos	As a new pc gamer coming from ps4 specifically for rainbowsix siege, this mouse is awesome
2156	pos	I changed a lot of keybinds to the mouse buttons and it works great
2157	pos	I love it, all the buttons are completely programmable, I've set it up so I can play som games with only my mouse, it's amazing
2158	pos	The best out there with a tight budget
2159	pos	I've had this for a little over a year with no issues
2159	pos	Has the option to change the weight to fit what you like
2160	neg	Less than a year, and my right click is gone to complete shit

2165	pos	Bought this for my wife, who uses it for gaming
2165	pos	It is small enough that it fits her hand comfortably, but not too small

2168	pos	Comfortable
2168	pos	Neat settings and features
2169	pos	Excellent
2170	pos	Good gaming mouse with lots of different levels of customization of dpi, problem is hand oils stick to it and Logitech’s program for its devices no longer detects the mouse so I no longer can control what each dpi setting is on the mouse
2171	pos	amazing works and holds up very well
2172	neg	Cool mouse, but only useful for mild gaming
2172	neg	There are only 2 buttons on the side and they only read as 1 and 2 (the numbers above the letters on your keyboard), not as extra mouse buttons
2172	neg	There's also no way to configure how they are read by your computer
2173	pos	Is overall a great mouse
2173	pos	It’s just that when I use it sometimes the mouse lags a tiny bit when I move the cursor which can be really annoying to deal with
2174	pos	Very impressive
2174	pos	Much better then any other mouse I've bought, would definitely recommend
2174	pos	I've had it for a couple months and is functioning as intended

2180	pos	Every mouse I have used before this was crap
2180	pos	I never really wanted to put much into a mouse, but for this price it is well worth it
2180	pos	I put all the weights into the mouse and I love the options
2181	neg	This is my second mouse and they both both defective for the exact same reason
2181	neg	Click and hold is intermittent

2182	pos	I love this mouse
2182	pos	Can't image using anything else at this point
2183	pos	Could be a tad bigger, but i have large hands
2183	pos	5/5 for normal hands
2184	neg	Has problems with double clicking and draging and dropping 3 months in
2184	neg	Constantly double clicks or fails to drag because of bad left mouse button inputs

2185	pos	It hasn’t broken
2186	neg	Unfortunately the day after the return window closed, this mouse quit working properly

2190	pos	Feels great in the hand, the extra buttons are really nice and the response time on the buttons is excellent
2190	pos	I like my dpi a bit higher (~1100 dpi) and this mouse provides a great feeling of control for that with its extra weight
2191	pos	Bought for my son he seems to like it said it works great
2191	pos	Shipped fast
2192	neg	Scroll wheel breaks for no reason
2192	neg	This is the second one I got

2193	pos	I got this for my grandson; he seemed to like it

2196	pos	La compre para mi hija y le gusto
2197	neg	When I purchased the mouse, it was marked as being new
2197	neg	When I got the mouse, some things where missing from the packaging, the mouse was very dirty as it seems to have been used already and the box torn up
2198	pos	What does ergonomic mean
2198	pos	I like this mouse
2199	pos	Great mouse
2199	pos	Love all the buttons
2200	pos	The box come in  really bad conditions without protection of amazon like another box or anything
2200	pos	But the mouse didn't suffer any damage
2200	pos	So i'm happy with it
2201	pos	Solid mouse, 403 had smoother wheel but these keys are easier to feel and the multi key repeating is more consistent on this one
2202	pos	I was tired of plugging in my mouse to charge it
2202	pos	This mouse has even more buttons and is just as ergonomic
2203	pos	G402 felt better for grip
2203	pos	This one is 4 stars
2203	pos	The G402 get's 5 stars from me
2203	pos	That should sum it up nicely
2204	pos	It’s a great mouse if you don’t like light mouses because you can add weight on it
2205	pos	Replacement mouse loving D3 again
2205	pos	Buttons take a little getting used to but working better than expected
2206	pos	Logitech brought the power yet again

2209	pos	Great gaming mouse
2210	pos	comfortable for degenerate binge gaming for extended periods of time & u can add weights to the mouse to become even stronger, physically and mentally
2211	pos	There’s a lot of buttons to customize and it looks very cool but it was too big for my hand (small size)
2212	pos	El mouse en general fue mucho de mi agrado, muy comodo y se siente muy alta calidad la verdad un mouse clasico que recomiendo mucho si vas a comprar un mouse
2213	pos	I've now bought two of these
2213	pos	My first one began double clicking after several years, but I bought another one because I do like the design
2214	pos	Very solid mouse but the scroll wheel absolutely sucks
2214	pos	Both modes are bad
2215	pos	Love all of the features and it works well
2216	pos	Enjoy it
2217	pos	Good mouse, the app for programming it is not that good, I changed the dpi buttons to other buttons for my games but they would revert back to dpi buttons randomly, I would have to go back in the application and change them again here and there but the mouse itself is really good
2218	pos	Good
2219	pos	The media could not be loaded
2219	pos	El producto se publica como nuevo
2219	pos	Pero cómo ven me llegó uno re acondicionado
2220	pos	Works great for gaming
2221	neg	In just under 3 months the Right Mouse button has stopped working and now I cannot play and ADS on my fps games
2221	neg	Not satisfied with the longevity of it
2221	neg	One star until support fixes my defective profuct
2222	pos	Best mouse in the world this mouse is amazing I bought it to play fortnite because my other mouse laser was worn out and failing this mouse was an amazing alternative although 16k dpi is cool it’s completely unnecessary I just love this mouse in general
2223	pos	this mouse works good on hard wood or whatever, however it does not work on mouse pads
2224	pos	Very responsive and amazing accuracy
2225	pos	They've come out with different models and I just think this one is their best one
2225	pos	This is the third one of the g502 that I've purchased
2225	pos	Love it
2226	pos	Fácil de de configurar, un poco grande para mi gusto pero ofrece muy buenos resultados y los botones extras un éxito total lo uso para dota 2 y apex legend
2227	pos	Great mouse for gaming; I have small hands and it's not too big or heavy (especially because you can adjust the weight by switching out metal pieces inside) for me
2227	pos	Very comfortable, even for long gaming sessions
2228	pos	great mouse, can't really drag click on it but other than that it combines all the good features of my other mice into one
2229	pos	It is a great mouse, the free spinning scroll wheel is a god send
2229	pos	It lasts forever and it fits great in the hand
2230	pos	This is a very good mouse if you want a good mouse for an affordable price
2230	pos	I use it to game Fortnite and i can say that my game improved with this mouse
2231	pos	Very (VERY) happy with this mouse, feels fast and light for gaming
2231	pos	Highly recommend
2232	neg	I  bought this mouse a few months ago and now it won'ts stop disconnecting and reconnecting to my computer
2232	neg	Very annoying
2232	neg	Would like something done to fix this
2233	pos	Its so beautiful thank you
2234	pos	Everything about it is great, excellent, or perfect
2234	pos	I'm astonished, quite frankly
2235	neg	Worked great, really enjoyed it, until 4 months of normal use later, when its cable futzed out, and it would no longer connect to my computer
2235	neg	Best mouse in the world ain't worth jack shit if I can't connect it to my computer
2236	neg	Avoid this mouse
2236	neg	Guaranteed double clicking after around 6 months
2236	neg	I've gone through two of these mice with normal use and the third is probably going to be dead out of the box at this point
2236	neg	I recommend selling the mice if you get a warranty replacement and buying something else
2237	pos	I love everything about this beauty of a mouse
2238	pos	I love this mouse, I had the previous version the g 502 proteus core and it lasted me 8 years
2238	pos	I was sold on logitech after that
2239	pos	The mouse is smooth and easy to use and setup
2239	pos	The integrated memory lets you keep setups across devices easily
2239	pos	The only thing I would like to be improved would be the upload times of the profiles, and the load times of them when plugging in the mouse
2239	pos	Other than that it's perfect
2240	pos	Great for gaming
2240	pos	Has weights 2
2240	pos	5 grams 5 of them
2240	pos	Very precise and the user interface makes customizing very simple
2241	pos	Mouse clicks noticeably lighter/cheaper feeling to me, infinite scroll wheel gummed up in less than one month, the new software is lacking features namely macro function using the on-board profile doesn't work, over all its a good mouse that has fallen victim to updates and newer = better fallacy
2242	neg	Every time I plug it into my PC it decides to stop working or just move on its own, when I use my other mouse it works just fine it’s not input lag the mouse has been also used before I can see that
2243	pos	I ordered it yesterday and it arrived the next day, and the game feels great in my hands
2243	pos	It also adds iron to add weight to the mouse
2243	pos	I love this mouse
2244	pos	This is the definitive mouse for gaming
2244	pos	super customizeable in terms of DPI, hell even the weight for mouse is customizable
2244	pos	This thing is great out of the box no customization needed but if you do want customize any of it, all the drivers are easy to find and work with
2245	pos	I imported it from the USA to Colombia, the box arrived a little damaged but is normal for this kind of shipping, the product functions perfect and is the best mouse I've ever had, 100% recommended
2246	pos	I've blew threw 9 mice this year and this one seems to be the winner of them all wired or not
2247	pos	Amazing mouse and good software
2247	pos	Not good for people with big hands, the mouse doesn’t have any arch to it
2248	pos	Nothing
2249	pos	It's good
2250	neg	2021, after a year usage this mouse got serious left click issues
2250	neg	very disappointed that logitech products got such issues
2250	neg	Received in good condition with box
2250	neg	Like the free willy scrolling
2250	neg	Dislike the slightly lower profile of the mouse
2250	neg	Overall a good product, guess I need some time getting use
2251	pos	Nice upgrade from a standard vanilla, non-gaming mouse
2251	pos	My son loved the weights you can add to customize and it has worked great for several months
2251	pos	I'm planning on buying one myself
2252	neg	Bought two on March 5th 2020
2252	neg	One for both my wife and I
2252	neg	Both mice started having problems with the left click button by June 1st same year
2252	neg	I have reached out to Logitech customer service but haven’t heard back yet
2253	neg	Much smaller than exoected
2254	neg	Don't get this one, the left mouse is faulty on all of them and it will just break eventually
2255	pos	like versatility,cost and response
2256	neg	This mouse is too big to hold in the hand , my hand is a bit difficult to operate
2257	pos	Great dpi, nice quality, and awesome rgb
2257	pos	My mom wants one
2257	pos	:)
2258	pos	Great Product
2259	neg	This mouse was great
2259	neg	Until it wasn't
2259	neg	Now, the LMB is always microclicking, missing clicks, or just in general on the fritz
2260	pos	I'm a software engineer and using this mouse 10 hours a day for the past couple of years
2260	pos	It is perfect
2260	pos	I have 3 of them (office , home, my wife's computer)
2261	pos	I keep hitting button 4 lol fat thumb lol other than that a great mouse
2262	pos	I had the Proteus Core for about eight years and the only reason I replaced it is because I wore it the hell out
2262	pos	This is the same amazing mouse with a few tweaks
2262	pos	I honestly hate the gaming mice with dozens of buttons
2262	pos	This one is absolutely perfect
2263	pos	I love this mouse
2263	pos	It is high quality with nice weight which feels really nice in your hand
2263	pos	It is a bigger style mouse so if you have tiny hands this might not be the mouse for you, but as for me, I have probably above average sized hands and man does this mouse feel great
2264	pos	Awesome mouse for an awesome deal
2264	pos	Very happy with this purchase and I do recommend this mouse to others
2265	pos	i love this mouse but one problem i found is when you add the tuning weights the cover will lose its ability to stay strongly attached so if you also have this problem make sure the weights are all the way in
2266	pos	I think this mouse pad is perfect, it’s the best size I could find and I love it
2266	pos	It fits nice on my desk and I have so much room with this thing for my mouse
2266	pos	It makes me feel free when I game, I’d recommend this to anyone who is  looking for a new mouse pad for low dpi gaming
2267	pos	Great mouse for the price
2268	pos	Best mouse I've used in a long time perfect mouse for gaming been the best mouse I've had in a long while so worth it Marcos are so fun to mess with I recommend anyone should buy this mouse
2269	pos	Pretty good
2270	pos	Feels great
2270	pos	Weights make it a good option
2271	pos	The logitech application that can be downloaded on your pc is great
2271	pos	I didn’t find it heavy, but i didn’t add any weights
2272	pos	Pretty nice overall
2272	pos	The mouse wheel takes a long time to get used to
2273	neg	Its a bad mouse, i really liked it until mouse button 1 stopped working after 7 months
2273	neg	When i hold mb1 it doesn't work,  it only works to click
2273	neg	I want my money back or a new mouse
2274	pos	Works as expected
2275	pos	Fits hand well
2275	pos	scroll wheel stopped working under 2 weeks of use
2276	pos	works great feels great

2292	pos	Get it your MMO games will love it
2293	pos	This is a great mouse for gaming and just for everyday computer use
2293	pos	Super comfortable for long usage

2294	pos	Custom DPI settings and extra buttons help tons on FPS games
2295	pos	I love this mouse
2295	pos	Perfect weight and amazing buttons

2297	pos	So far my son loves it
2298	pos	Gaming mouse
2298	pos	Great feel
2299	pos	So in love with the way it feels
2300	pos	I bought this vs the Deathadder Elite, and it just doesn't track as well as my Deathadder
2300	pos	However, the weight system in the G502 is unmatched and the customizability of all the buttons was something I wish my other mouse had
2300	pos	Good mouse just not for me
2301	pos	Some buttons like the DPI buttons next to the left mouse button is too big and easy to accidentally click
2301	pos	And its a hassle to program them
2302	pos	Nice fit to my hand and easy to use with the PS5
2303	pos	Arrived quickly and functioned perfectly
2304	pos	Great product
2304	pos	Highly recommend this mouse for gaming

2308	pos	I've only heard good things about this mouse and it really delivered
2309	pos	It's all functional but I wish it had a manual that explains all the buttons and how they work 😅
2310	pos	Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves
2310	pos	Mouse for gaming
2311	pos	After a year, when I have to "drag and drop" between folders and programs, it slips and can't hold onto the items
2311	pos	Hope there is a fix
2312	pos	My hand doesn't hurt as much now
2312	pos	You'll like it
2312	pos	My hand fits around my junk which is about 2 inch's around
2312	pos	so that's the ball park
2313	pos	Mouse feels great, quality seems good for price
2314	pos	This mouse is great for gaming the fell is amazing and the rgb is outstanding
2314	pos	It has a very good glide
2315	pos	Out standing had it for a couple months no complain
2316	pos	Recomendado 100 % no da problemas y da muchas cosas mas que por el precio esta normal no barato y tampoco está caro
2317	pos	I recommend this mouse if you are looking for a mouse with more than four buttonsAll ten buttons are programmableIt is not the lightest mouse from LG but you can use it with a high speed mouse pad to make it feel light as a featherVERY FUN
2318	pos	My friend loves the mouse and it works well
2318	pos	However, the state of the box looks as if someone played football with it
2319	pos	This mouse is a 10/10 works perfectly and if you get the software for it you can customize your dpi and color of the mouse
2320	pos	Title
2321	pos	I use this mouse for Fortnight gaming
2321	pos	I like most it precision,  the ability to define each button
2321	pos	I didn't like the design- little complicated, the installation of it software wasn't easy, I had to contact costumer support
2322	pos	Overall great product
2323	pos	Son loves this one
2324	pos	High quality mouse, on sale its a no brainer pickup if you need a new mouse
2325	pos	Good product

2326	pos	Love the mouse it’s awesome
2327	pos	AMAZING MOUSE I bought it three times in a row it is so perfect, perfect for my hand perfect for everything, just an amazing mouse over all
2328	neg	After 10 months, the RMB randomly releases and engages when holding it for any amount of time, apparently it's a known issue, well done Logitech
2329	pos	Great mouse with a comfy shape
2329	pos	The tape/grip is very nice compared to my other mice
2330	pos	AMy grandson loved it
2331	neg	This mouse worked great for about 2 months, but now the clicker wont click
2331	neg	No more Logitech for me
2332	pos	Act like you have spin bot with 16k DPI
2332	pos	Worth the VAC ban
2333	pos	Logitech G502 HERO feel like legend
2334	pos	This mouse is great for gaming, the logitech software is easy to use
2334	pos	I would recommend this mouse to anyone looking to upgrade to a gaming mouse
2334	pos	The 16000 dpi is great for using multiple monitors but too sensitive to game with for me
2335	pos	coollll
2336	pos	Very nice mouse
2336	pos	Button layout and the overall size are great for smaller hands
2337	pos	use it, very good
2337	pos	only problem is after a year of use, the left click starts to misclick a lot
2338	pos	Perfect
2339	pos	Great mouse, OMG great mouse
2339	pos	great price it trashes the 20 dollar/no support/m8 and says goodbye forever
2340	pos	HAve not had any issues
2340	pos	However The GHUB softwear is combative with some games Anti cheat
2341	pos	Too many buttons that change dpi or have dpi setting
2341	pos	Nice wheel that had an option to keep spinning instead of stop
2342	pos	by far the best mouse I have had
2342	pos	feels great and the options are amazing
2343	pos	Upgrade from my older one, still amazing
2344	pos	My only issue is my thumb hits the side buttons
2344	pos	Otherwise it’s a good mouse
2345	pos	5 stars for the mouse- 1 star for Logitech’s software not working correctly
2346	pos	Love this mouse

2352	pos	Bought this for my son he is 10 and loves computers, he games develops games and animation stories he absolutely loves it
2352	pos	Highly recommended
2353	pos	Great product right out of the box
2353	pos	Comfortable and very responsive
2354	neg	Cons: The side light does not turn on (defective out of the box)
2354	neg	Pro: The infinite wheel is amazing
2355	pos	Been using it for less than 6 months and am having issues where it stops moving
2355	pos	The buttons still work, but to make it function again, I have to unplug it and plug it back in
2355	pos	Overall, I can't saw I'm overly happy about it, but when it was working it was decent
2356	pos	Very sleek really fits my hand
2357	pos	One of the best mouses I used I owned about 4 different mice in the last year and since I bought this one I’m never switching again or buying another unless it breaks than I’ll reorder this one
2358	pos	Tal cual se describe  mi hijo fasinado excelente  su funcion
2359	pos	My son is using it for gaming and has no problems
2359	pos	Everything seems to be working as it’s supposed to
2360	pos	Really good quality, comfortable shape, scroll wheel is awesome, button customization is great for both gaming and desktop use

2392	neg	basically use the mouse for its intended purpose
2393	neg	The scrolling wheel did not work when I received it, have to send it back and will have to upgrade to something else
